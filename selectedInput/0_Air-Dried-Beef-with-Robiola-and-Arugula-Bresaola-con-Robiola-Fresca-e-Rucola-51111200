1. Arrange the bresaola slices on a platter and allow them to come to room temperature, about 15 minutes.
2. Place the arugula in a large bowl. Drizzle with just enough olive oil to lightly coat the leaves, then season to taste with lemon juice, salt, and pepper, and toss to combine.
3. Mound the salad in the center of a serving platter, reserving some for garnish. Arrange the slices of bresaola and Robiola on top, garnish with the remaining arugula, and serve.

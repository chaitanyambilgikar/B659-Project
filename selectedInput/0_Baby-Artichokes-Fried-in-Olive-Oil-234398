Line platter with paper towels. Heat oil in heavy medium saucepan over medium-high heat until deep-fry thermometer registers 350°F. Using tongs, carefully lower 5 artichokes into oil. Cook until golden brown and wooden skewer inserted into center meets slight resistance, turning occasionally, 2 to 5 minutes, depending on size of artichoke. Using tongs, transfer artichokes to lined platter and drain. Repeat with remaining artichokes in 3 more batches. Sprinkle with salt and serve.

Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.
Peel, core, and cut the apples into 1/2-inch (1.5-cm) slices.
Lightly flour a work surface and roll out the dough into a circle about 14 inches (36 cm) in diameter. Transfer it to the prepared baking sheet.
Smear the frangipane over the dough, leaving a 2-inch (5-cm) border. Arrange the apple slices in concentric circles over the frangipane, or simply scatter them in an even layer. Fold the border of the dough over the apples and brush the crust with some of the melted butter, then lightly brush or dribble the rest of the butter over the apples. Sprinkle half of the sugar over the crust, and the remaining half over the apples.
Bake the galette until the apples are tender and the crust has browned, about 1 hour. Slide the galette off the parchment paper and onto a wire rack.
Serve warm or at room temperature. You can drizzle the galette with warm honey or glaze it with strained apricot jam, thinned with just enough water to make it spreadable.

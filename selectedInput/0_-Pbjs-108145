1. Lay the slices of bread on a breadboard. Spread the foie gras mousse on four of the slices. Sprinkle with coarse sea salt. Spread the jam on the other 4 slices of bread. Join the jam slices with the foie gras slices to make 4 sandwiches.
2. Using a bread knife, cut off the crusts with gentle sawing motions, then cut the sandwiches diagonally into quarters, so you end up with triangles. Stack on a serving platter and march them out to the party.

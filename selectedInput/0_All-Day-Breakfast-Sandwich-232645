Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderate heat until foam subsides, then add sausages and cook, turning, until browned, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and halve lengthwise. Return sausages to skillet and cook, cut sides down, until cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes more. Transfer to a plate and keep warm, covered with foil. Add bacon to skillet and cook, turning over once, until browned, 2 to 3 minutes total, then transfer to plate with sausage and cover again.
Add remaining tablespoon butter to skillet and heat until foam subsides. Crack eggs into skillet and season lightly with salt and pepper, then fry (sunny side up or over easy) until whites are cooked and yolks are just set, 4 to 5 minutes.
Make sandwiches with sausages, bacon, eggs, and baguette.

Cook first 3 ingredients covered in heavy small saucepan over medium heat until apricots are tender, about 20 minutes. Transfer contents of pan to processor. Add vanilla and puree, scraping down sides of bowl occasionally. Transfer puree to large bowl and cool. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and chill. Bring to room temperature before continuing.)
Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350°F. Spray 9x9x2-inch pan with vegetable oil spray. Using electric mixer, beat egg whites with pinch of salt in large bowl until soft peaks form. Gradually add sugar and continue beating until stiff but not dry. Fold whites into puree in 2 additions. Spoon apricot mixture into prepared pan, smoothing top. Place pan on baking sheet with sides. Pour enough water into baking sheet to measure 1/2 inch. Set sheet in oven and bake until apricot mixture is firm in center and golden brown, covering very loosely with foil if browning too quickly, about 40 minutes. Let stand at least 15 minutes and up to 3 hours.
Spoon apricot whip into deep bowls. Serve, passing berries separately.

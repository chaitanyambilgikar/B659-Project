Combine 2 cups chopped dried apricots, 1/2 cup chopped dried tart cherries, 1/2 cup sake or dry white wine, 1/4 cup fresh orange juice, 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice, and 1 cup water in a large saucepan; let soak for 2 hours. Place 1 whole star anise, 1 small bay leaf, 1/2 cinnamon stick, and 1/2 teaspoon finely grated peeled ginger in the center of a layer of cheesecloth. Gather up edges; tie with kitchen twine to form a bundle. Add to pan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat; reduce heat to low and cook, stirring often, for 30 minutes. Stir in 1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons miso. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until mixture is thickened, 5-10 minutes. Let cool.

Prepare the Delicious Slicing Bread, adding the vanilla extract to the dough. Set aside.
Lightly grease a 10-cup Bundt pan or fluted pan.
Combine the sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Toss 1 tablespoon of the sugar mixture over apples in a medium bowl and stir to coat. Set aside.
In a microwave-proof bowl, melt the butter in the microwave on medium high for 30 to 40 seconds, until melted. Stir in the brown sugar until dissolved. Pour into the bottom of the prepared pan and sprinkle half the pecans, if using, over the brown sugar mixture.
Spray a 1/4-cup scoop with vegetable spray. Scoop out balls of the bread dough and arrange in one layer over the pecan and brown sugar mixture. (This will yield about eight scoops or half the dough.) Sprinkle half of the remaining cinnamon sugar over the balls of dough. Spread the apples over the dough and top with a second layer of balls of dough, using all the remaining dough. Sprinkle with the remaining cinnamon sugar and the remaining pecans over the top. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and set in a warm, draft free area to rise about 45 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 375°F. Remove the plastic wrap from the dough and bake for 30 to 35 minutes, until the top is brown. Remove to a wire rack and cool for 10 minutes. Invert onto a serving plate. Let cool an additional 10 minutes. Pull apart or slice with a bread knife. The monkey bread is best served warm, and can be reheated in a 350°F oven for 5 to 7 minutes.
Shortcuts: Use a commercial bread mix in place of the Delicious Slicing Bread.
Place pecan halves in a plastic zip-top bag and seal. Crush with a rolling pin until coarsely chopped.

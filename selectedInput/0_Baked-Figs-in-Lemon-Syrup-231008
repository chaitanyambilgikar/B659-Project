Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350°F. 3Boil water and 1/2 cup sugar in a small saucepan, stirring, until sugar is dissolved. Remove syrup from heat. Squeeze enough juice from 2 lemons to measure 1/3 cup and stir into syrup, then discard lemon halves.
Remove zest from remaining lemon in long strips with a vegetable peeler and, if necessary, trim any white pith from zest with a sharp paring knife. Cut zest lengthwise into thin julienne strips. Reserve lemon.
Blanch zest in a 1- to 1 1/2-quart saucepan of boiling water 1 second, then drain in a sieve and add to syrup. 3Cut away any remaining pith from lemon. Working over a bowl, cut segments free from membranes.
Spread butter in a 1 1/2-quart flameproof gratin dish or 10-inch heavy ovenproof skillet. Arrange figs, cut sides up, slightly overlapping in 1 layer. Sprinkle with remaining 2 teaspoons sugar and bake until figs are softened and begin to exude juice but still hold their shape, 25 to 30 minutes.
Transfer figs with a slotted spoon to a shallow serving bowl and put gratin dish or skillet over a burner at moderately high heat.
Add syrup and deglaze gratin dish or skillet by boiling until syrup is reduced to about 3/4 cup, 6 to 8 minutes. Add lemon segments along with any juices in bowl and pour syrup (with lemon segments) over figs. Cool to warm or room temperature before serving.

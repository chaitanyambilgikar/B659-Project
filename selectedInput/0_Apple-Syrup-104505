Combine apple juice and sugar in heavy large saucepan. Bring to boil over medium-high heat, stirring until sugar dissolves. Boil 10 minutes. Add apple and raisins and boil until mixture is reduced to 1 1/2 cups, about 15 minutes longer. Stir in butter and cinnamon. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Rewarm over low heat until heated through.) Serve warm.

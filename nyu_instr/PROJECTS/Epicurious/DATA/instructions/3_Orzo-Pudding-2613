Preheat oven to 350° F. Combine milk and orzo in heavy medium saucepan. Bring to simmer, stirring constantly. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook uncovered until orzo is tender, stirring mixture occasionally and scraping bottom of pan, about 15 minutes.
Whisk egg yolks, whole egg, sugar and salt in medium bowl to blend. Gradually whisk in hot milk and orzo mixture. Add raisins. Return mixture to same saucepan. Stir over medium-low heat until mixture thickens and just begins to bubble, about 3 minutes. Stir in vanilla and nutmeg. Divide pudding among four 3/4-cup custard cups. Place custard cups in 8x8-inch baking pan. Add enough hot water to pan to come halfway up sides of cups. Bake until puddings are set, about 15 minutes. Remove from pan. Serve warm, or cover and chill up to 1 day.

For Celery Root Puree:1. Place the milk, water, salt, celery root, and potatoes in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Lower the heat; simmer until the vegetables are very tender, 20 to 25 minutes; drain and return them to the pan.
2.Place the pan over low heat to cook off excess moisture; transfer the vegetables to a food processor. Add the butter, then puree until just smooth and creamy. Season with salt and pepper. Keep warm.
For Braised Celery1. Trim the bottom of each celery bunch (make sure the ribs remain together); then measure 5 inches up from the bottom and cut off the celery tops at that point (you'll be using the bottom end). Remove and discard the 3 or 4 tough outer ribs. Remove any stringy parts with a vegetable peeler; cut each bunch of celery lengthwise into quarters.
2. Warm the oil in a large sauté pan or skillet over medium heat. Add the carrot, turnip and celery quarters; season with salt and pepper and cook 3 minutes. Pour in the broth and bring to a boil.
3. Adjust the heat so that the broth simmers steadily. Cook the vegetables for about 25 minutes or until they are very tender and the liquid is nearly gone. You should have tender vegetables lightly glazed with the broth. Remove and discard the carrots and turnips. Serve the celery immediately.

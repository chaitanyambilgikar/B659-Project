In a bowl with an electric mixer beat the cream until it just holds stiff peaks, add the sugar and the ground ginger, and beat the mixture until it holds stiff peaks. Fold in the 1/4 cup candied ginger, transfer the whipped cream to a serving bowl, and garnish it with the additional candied ginger.

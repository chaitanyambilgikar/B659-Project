For crust: Mix flour, sugar, cinnamon, and salt in processor. Add butter; using on/off turns, process until mixture resembles coarse meal. Whisk honey, yolks, and 1 tablespoon ice water in bowl. Add honey mixture to flour mixture; using on/off turns, process until clumps form. Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk. Wrap in plastic; chill 1 hour.
Roll dough out on floured surface to 12-inch round. Transfer to 10-inch tart pan with removable bottom. Press dough onto bottom and up sides of pan. Fold overhang in; press to form double layer. Cover and chill 30 minutes or up to 1 day.
For streusel: Mix all ingredients in medium bowl. Using fingertips, rub in butter until pea-size clumps form. Refrigerate while preparing filling.
For filling: Preheat oven to 350°F. Whisk first 4 ingredients in large bowl to blend. Add grated apples; stir to coat.
Transfer to crust, spreading evenly. Sprinkle streusel over. Bake until streusel is golden and filling is bubbling, about 1 hour. Cool. (Can be made 8 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.)

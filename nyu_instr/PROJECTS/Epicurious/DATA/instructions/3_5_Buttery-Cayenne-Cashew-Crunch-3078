Butter nonstick baking sheet. Combine all ingredients in large nonstick skillet. Stir over low heat until butter melts and sugars dissolve. Increase heat to medium and boil, stirring constantly until mixture turns golden brown, thickens and begins to mass together, about 5 minutes. Immediately pour out onto prepared baking sheet, spreading evenly. Cool completely. Break into pieces.

Simmer stock and pasilla chilies in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat until chilies are soft, about 20 minutes. Strain pasilla broth into medium bowl, pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard solids in strainer.
Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add onion, corn, and garlic; sauté 1 minute. Add pasilla broth, mussels, butter, and lime juice. Cover and simmer until mussels open, about 2 minutes. Uncover; stir in jicama and cilantro. Season broth to taste with salt. Transfer mussels with broth to large bowl (discard any mussels that do not open). Serve, passing lime wedges separately.
* Available at Latin American markets and in the produce section of some supermarkets.

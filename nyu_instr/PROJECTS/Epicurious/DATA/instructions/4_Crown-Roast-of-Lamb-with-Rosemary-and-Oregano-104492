Preheat oven to 450°F. Mix chopped rosemary, minced garlic, chopped oregano, salt and black pepper in small bowl. Place crown roasts of lamb, spaced apart, on large baking sheet. Brush lamb all over with olive oil. Rub herb mixture all over lamb. Cover bones loosely with sheet of foil. Roast lamb until instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of lamb registers 125°F to 130°F for rare, about 20 minutes (or 130°F to 135°F for medium-rare, about 30 minutes; or 135°F to 140°F for medium, about 35 minutes).
Transfer lamb to platter; let stand 5 to 10 minutes. Remove foil and string. Cut lamb between ribs into chops and serve.

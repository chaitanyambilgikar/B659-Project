Preheat oven to 475°F. Lightly sprinkle rimmed baking sheet with flour. Roll out pizza dough on lightly floured surface 1/4-inch thick. Using 2 1/2-inch diameter cookie cutter, cut 16 dough rounds. Arrange rounds on prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle rounds with Fontina cheese, dividing equally. Place 2 tomato quarters on each round, pressing gently into dough. Sprinkle tomatoes with Parmesan cheese. (Can be prepared 2 hours ahead. Cover and chill.)
Bake pizzette until golden brown, about 12 minutes. Drizzle pizzette with olive oil, then sprinkle with basil and lightly with salt and pepper. Drape prosciutto strips over. Arrange on platter and serve immediately.

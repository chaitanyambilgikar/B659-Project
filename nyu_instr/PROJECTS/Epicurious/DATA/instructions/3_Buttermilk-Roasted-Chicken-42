Remove giblets from chicken. Place chicken in heavy large plastic bag. Pour buttermilk into bag. Seal bag. Turn to coat chicken. Refrigerate 1 to 2 days, turning occasionally.
Position rack in lowest 1/3 of oven and preheat to 400°F. Place rack on baking sheet. Remove chicken from buttermilk marinade and place on rack breast side up. Season with salt and pepper. Roast until juices from thigh run clear when pierced with a small knife, covering loosely with foil toward the end if browning too quickly, approximately 1 hour. Let chicken stand 10 minutes before serving.

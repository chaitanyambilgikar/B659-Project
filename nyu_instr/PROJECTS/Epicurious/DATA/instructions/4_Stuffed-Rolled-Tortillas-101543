Preheat oven to 375°F.
Spread about 1/4 to 1/3 cup of the filling on each of the tortillas, then dot the filling with 2 tablespoons of the ricotta. Roll up the tortillas into tight cylinders.
Spread 3/4 cup of the spaghetti sauce over the bottom of a baking dish large enough to hold the tortillas in a single layer.Set the tortills, seam side down, on the sauce. Spread the remaining sauce over the tortillas and top with the shredded cheese. Bake until the filling is hot and the cheese has melted, about 20 minutes.
Meanwhile prepare the garnishes. Serve the tortillas hot and pass the garnishes.

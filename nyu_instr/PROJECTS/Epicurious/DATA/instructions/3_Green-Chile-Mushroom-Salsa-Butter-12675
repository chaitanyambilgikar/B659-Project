In a food processor blend together salsa butter, and salt until combined well. (Salsa butter may be made 3 days ahead and covered, chilled.)
To make the salsa: Heat a dry comal or flat iron griddle over moderately low heat until hot and pan-roast poblanos, tomatoes, and garlic, turning them occasionally to ensure even roasting, until browned and soft throughout, 25 to 30 minutes.
While vegetables are roasting, if using dried morels, in a small bowl soak in hot water until soft, about 15 minutes. Remove morels from soaking liquid and halve. Strain soaking liquid through a sieve lined with paper towels into another small bowl, reserving soaking liquid. If using fresh morels, wash well, pat dry, trim, and halve.
In a small heavy skillet heat oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and sauté dried or fresh morels, stirring, until browned lightly, about 1 minute. If using dried morels, add reserved soaking liquid and boil until liquid is evaporated. Sauté dried or fresh morels, stirring until browned, about 3 minutes more.
Wearing rubber gloves, stem and seed chiles. Discard tomato stems and garlic stems.
In a food processor pulse chiles, tomatoes, garlic, morels, and epazote until chopped coarse (do not purée). In a bowl stir together chile mixture, water, and salt. (Salsa may be made 3 days ahead and chilled, covered. Bring salsa to room temperature before using.) Makes about 1 1/2 cups.

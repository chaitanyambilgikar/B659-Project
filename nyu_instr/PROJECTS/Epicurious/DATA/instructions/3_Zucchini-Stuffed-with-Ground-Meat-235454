Preheat oven to 400°F.
In small saucepan over high heat, combine rice and 1/2 cup water. Bring to boil, then reduce heat and simmer, covered, until water is absorbed, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside to cool.
In medium skillet over moderately high heat, heat oil until hot but not smoking. Add beef and sauté, stirring occasionally and breaking up large lumps with wooden spoon, until meat is browned, about 10 minutes. Set aside to cool.
Using apple corer or small melon-ball cutter and working from both ends, hollow out each zucchini, removing all seeds and leaving shells about 1/3 inch thick. Discard pulp and seeds. Place zucchini in large bowl and add 6 cups cold water and 2 tablespoons salt. Soak 15 minutes, then rinse, pat dry, and set aside.
Cut shallow X through skin at bottom of each tomato. Bring medium pot of water to boil. Fill medium bowl with cold water and place on work surface near pot. Working in batches, add tomatoes to boiling water and cook 30 seconds to blanch. Using slotted spoon, transfer each batch to cold water to cool quickly. Using small sharp knife as aid and starting at X on bottom, pull skin off tomatoes. Cut tomatoes in half; remove and discard seeds. Cut tomatoes into small dice.
In large bowl, combine rice, beef, and tomatoes. Mix in pepper and remaining 1 teaspoon salt. Using small spoon, stuff 4 tablespoons of mixture into each zucchini.
Arrange zucchini in nonstick baking pan or ovenproof dish. Pour tomato juice over. Drizzle with ghee and bake 30 minutes, or until knife slides in easily and sauce is thickened. Serve hot.

Quarter dough, then roll out each piece into an 8-inch round with a rolling pin. Put one fourth of cheese filling (about 1/3 cup) in center of 1 round and fold dough in half to enclose filling and form a semicircle. Press edges together to seal. Beginning at 1 end and working toward the other, stretch sealed edge outward, pinching and rolling edge to form a rope. Transfer to baking sheet. Make 3 more calzones in same manner, transferring to baking sheet.
Bake calzones until golden and puffed, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool on baking sheet 5 minutes before serving.

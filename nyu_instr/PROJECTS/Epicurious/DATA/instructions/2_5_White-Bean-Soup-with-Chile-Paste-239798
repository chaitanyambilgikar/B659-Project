For chile paste: Place chiles in bowl; add enough water to cover. Let stand at room temperature overnight. Drain. Boil 1 1/2 cups water, sugar, and chiles in small saucepan until 2 tablespoons liquid remain, about 15 minutes. Transfer to processor; puree until smooth. With machine running, gradually add oil. Season with salt and pepper. DO AHEAD: Can be made 3 days ahead. Cover; chill.
For soup: Place beans in large pot. Add enough water to cover by 4 inches. Let soak overnight.
Drain beans. Melt butter in same pot over medium-high heat. Add celery, carrot, onion, and garlic; cook until soft, stirring often, about 15 minutes. Add beans and 8 cups water. Bring to boil, reduce heat to low, and cook until beans are soft, stirring occasionally, about 1 1/2 hours. Stir in cumin and coriander; cool. Working in batches, puree soup in blender, adding water by 1/4 cupfuls if too thick. Return to same pot. Stir in cream. Season with salt and pepper. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover; chill.
Rewarm soup. Divide among bowls. Drizzle with chile paste. Swirl paste into soup; serve.

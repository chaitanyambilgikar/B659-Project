Wash rice in several changes of water until water runs clear, then drain rice well in a sieve. Bring rice and 3 cups water to a boil in a 3-quart heavy saucepan and cook, covered, over very low heat until water is absorbed and rice is tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove pan from heat and let stand, covered, 10 minutes. Fluff rice gently with a fork.
Heat oil in a deep 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then cook mustard seeds, stirring, until seeds begin to pop. Add ginger and 1/4 cup peanuts and cook, stirring, 2 minutes. Add turmeric, rice, and salt to taste, stirring to coat rice thoroughly. Remove skillet from heat and stir in lemon juice. Sprinkle with remaining peanuts and zest.

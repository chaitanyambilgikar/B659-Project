Heat oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then cook onion, bell peppers, garlic, salt, and pepper, stirring occasionally, until onion is golden, about 15 minutes.
While peppers cook, preheat broiler and prick sausages all over with a fork, then broil sausages on rack of a broiler pan 3 to 5 inches from heat, turning over once, until golden brown and cooked through, 10 to 12 minutes.
Transfer sausages to a cutting board and let stand 5 minutes, then halve lengthwise.
Make 4 sandwiches using bread, pepper mixture, and sausages.

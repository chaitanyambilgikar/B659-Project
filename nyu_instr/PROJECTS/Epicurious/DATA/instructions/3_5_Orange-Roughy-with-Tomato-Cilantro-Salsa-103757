For salsa: Toss all ingredients in large bowl to combine. Cover and refrigerate. (Can be made 4 hours ahead. Keep chilled.)
For fish: Preheat oven to 400°F. Heat oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle fish with salt and pepper. Place flour in shallow baking dish. Coat fish with flour. Working in batches, sauté fish until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Using spatula, transfer fish to baking sheet. Bake fish until opaque in center, about 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, cook haricots verts in large pot of boiling salted water until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Drain. Transfer to ice water to cool; drain. Season to taste with lemon juice and olive oil. Divide haricots verts equally among plates. Top with fish fillet and salsa.
*Chipotle chilies canned in a spicy tomato sauce, sometimes called adobo, are available at Latin American markets, specialty foods stores and some supermarkets.

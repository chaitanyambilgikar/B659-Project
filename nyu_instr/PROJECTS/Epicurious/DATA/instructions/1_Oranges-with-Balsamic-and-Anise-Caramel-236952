Bring sugar, water, and anise seeds to a boil in a 1- to 1 1/2-quart heavy nonreactive saucepan, washing down any sugar crystals on side of pan with a pastry brush dipped in cold water and stirring until sugar is dissolved. Boil syrup, without stirring, gently swirling pan, until mixture is a golden caramel. Reduce heat to low and carefully stir in vinegar (mixture will steam vigorously and caramel will harden). Stir until caramel is dissolved, about 1 minute.

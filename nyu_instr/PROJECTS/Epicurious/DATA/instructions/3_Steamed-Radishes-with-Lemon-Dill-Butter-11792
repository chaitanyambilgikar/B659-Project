In a steamer set over boiling water steam the radishes, covered, for 5 minutes, or until they are just tender. In a large skillet melt the butter over moderately low heat, add the radishes, the lemon juice, the dill, and salt and pepper to taste, and heat the mixture, stirring, until the radishes are heated through.

Peel shrimp and, if desired, devein. With tweezers remove any bones from fish fillets.
Preheat oven to 300°F.
Finely chop shallots. Cut butter into tablespoons. In a small saucepan boil wine, broth, lemon juice, and shallots until liquid is reduced by about half. Whisk in 2 tablespoons oil and simmer until emulsified, about 2 minutes. Remove pan from heat and whisk in butter 1 piece at a time, adding each new piece before previous one is incorporated. Keep sauce warm, covered. (It should not get hot enough to separate.)
Halve zucchini lengthwise and cut crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick pieces. In a small saucepan of boiling salted water cook zucchini until just tender, about 1 minute, and drain in a sieve. In a bowl toss zucchini with 1 tablespoon sauce and keep warm, covered.
Pat fish fillets dry and season with salt and pepper. In a large nonstick skillet heat 2 tablespoons oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and in batches sear fish, skin sides down, until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Turn fish over and cook until just cooked through, about 2 minutes more for rouget and about 4 minutes more for snapper. (Add more oil if necessary between batches.) Transfer fish as cooked to a shallow baking pan and keep warm, covered, in middle of oven.
Wipe skillet clean and heat 2 tablespoons oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking. Sauté shrimp, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and just cooked through, about 4 minutes.
Mound mash in center of each of 6 plates and top with fish. Arrange shrimp and zucchini evenly around mash and drizzle sauce over all.

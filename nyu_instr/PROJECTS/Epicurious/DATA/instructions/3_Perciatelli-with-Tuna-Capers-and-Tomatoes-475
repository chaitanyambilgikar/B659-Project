Cook pasta in pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite.
Meanwhile, heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-low heat. Add anchovies with capers and garlic and sauté 2 minutes, mashing to paste with back of fork. Mix in tomatoes with their juices and white wine. Increase heat to medium-high and cook until sauce thickens slightly, about 5 minutes. Add tuna and parsley and mix to break up large tuna chunks.
Drain pasta. Add to sauce and toss to blend. Season to taste with pepper.

Preheat oven to 350°F with rack in middle.
Remove wrappings from cheese, then enclose cheese in box and bake on a baking sheet 20 minutes. Let stand while making toasts.
Meanwhile, mince and mash garlic to a paste with 1/4 teaspoon salt, then stir together with pimentón and butter. Spread butter thinly onto bread and bake until just crisp, 10 to 15 minutes.
Cut off top rind of cheese and serve cheese warm with toasts.

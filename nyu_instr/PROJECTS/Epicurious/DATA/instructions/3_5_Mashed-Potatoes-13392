In a kettle combine the potatoes with enough cold water to cover them by 2 inches, bring the water to a boil, and add salt to taste. Simmer the potatoes for 1 hour, or until they are tender, drain them, and return them to the kettle. Steam the potatoes, covered, shaking the kettle, for 30 seconds, or until they are dry. Peel the potatoes while they are still warm, force them through a ricer or a food mill fitted with the coarse disk into a bowl, and beat in the milk, scalded, the butter, and salt and pepper to taste. Transfer the potatoes to a heated serving dish.

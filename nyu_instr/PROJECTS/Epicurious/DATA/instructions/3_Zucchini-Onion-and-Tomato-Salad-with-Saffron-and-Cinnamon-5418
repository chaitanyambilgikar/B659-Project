Heat oil in large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add zucchini, onions, garlic, cinnamon stick and saffron. Cover; cook until zucchini is tender and onions are almost tender, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in tomatoes, parsley and mint. Cool to room temperature. (Can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.) Mix in lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper and serve.

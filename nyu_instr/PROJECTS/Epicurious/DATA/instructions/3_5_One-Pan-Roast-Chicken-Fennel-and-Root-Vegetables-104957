Preheat oven to 425°F. Rinse chicken; pat dry with paper towels. Rub chicken with 1 tablespoon oil; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place in center of large rimmed baking sheet. Roast 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, toss potatoes, carrots, and fennel with remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil in large bowl to coat. Crumble oregano in small bowl; mix in garlic powder. Sprinkle all but 1/4 teaspoon oregano mixture over vegetables; toss to coat.

Roast chicken and vegetables until cooked through and golden, brushing chicken once with any pan juices and turning vegetables over once with spatula, about 1 hour. Arrange chicken and vegetables on platter; garnish with reserved fennel fronds. Scrape any pan juices into bowl and serve alongside.

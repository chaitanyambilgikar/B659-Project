Preheat oven to 375°F. Using 2-inch-diameter cookie cutter, cut out 8 rounds from each tortilla. Place rounds on heavy large baking sheet. Brush both sides of tortilla rounds with olive oil. Bake until rounds are golden and crisp, about 9 minutes. Set tortilla wafers aside.
Preheat oven to 400°F. Sprinkle 3 tablespoons water over heavy rimmed baking sheet. Place salmon fillet, skin side down, on baking sheet. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Bake until salmon is opaque in center, about 15 minutes. Cool completely. Remove skin from salmon. Coarsely flake salmon into large bowl.
Combine flaked salmon, smoked salmon, crème fraîche, and butter in food processor. Using on/off turns, blend ingredients just until coarse paste forms (do not overprocess).
Transfer salmon mixture to medium bowl. Stir in tarragon, lemon juice, and lemon peel. Season rillettes to taste with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate until firm, about 2 hours. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Store wafers airtight at room temperature. Keep rillettes refrigerated.)
Spread rillettes over tortilla wafers. Arrange wafers on platter. Sprinkle with chives and serve.

In a steamer set over boiling water steam the potatoes, covered, for 10 to 12 minutes, or until they are just tender, transfer them to a bowl, and let them cool to room temperature. In another bowl toss the okra with the cornmeal and salt and pepper to taste, transfer the mixture to a sieve, and shake off the excess cornmeal. In a deep skillet heat 1 inch of the oil to 375°F., in it fry the okra, stirring, for 2 minutes, or until it is golden, and transfer it to paper towels to drain. In a small bowl whisk together the vinegar, the honey, the mayonnaise, 1 tablespoon water, and salt and pepper to taste. Add the dressing to the potatoes with the okra and the tomato and combine the salad well.

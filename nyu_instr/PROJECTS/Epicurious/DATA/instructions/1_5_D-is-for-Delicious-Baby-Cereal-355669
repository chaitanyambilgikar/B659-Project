In a food processor, grind the brown rice or oatmeal until it is a fine powdery substance (babies over 7 months can have unground). Transfer to a medium saucepan, add the water, and cook on medium heat, until thick and cooked through, about 3 minutes. Let cool and add a tablespoon or two of breast milk or formula until desired consistency is reached. Serve lukewarm or at room temperature.

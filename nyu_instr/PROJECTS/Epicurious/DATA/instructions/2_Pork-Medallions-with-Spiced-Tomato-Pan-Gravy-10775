In a large heavy skillet heat the oil over moderately high heat until it is hot but not smoking and in it brown the pork, patted dry, transferring it as it is browned to a plate. In the fat remaining in the skillet cook the onion and the garlic over moderate heat, stirring, until the onion is golden, add the tomato purée, the water, the nutmeg, the coriander, and the cloves, and simmer the mixture for 10 minutes. Stir in the pork and any juices that have accumulated on the plate and simmer the mixture, covered, for 5 minutes, or until the pork is cooked through. Season the pan gravy with salt and pepper and serve it with the pork over the noodles.

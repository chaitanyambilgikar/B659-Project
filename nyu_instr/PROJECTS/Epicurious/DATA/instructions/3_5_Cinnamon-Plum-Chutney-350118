Stir mustard seeds in small dry skillet over medium heat until seeds darken slightly and begin to pop, about 5 minutes. Transfer seeds to heavy large saucepan. Add plums, brown sugar, vinegar, onion, cinnamon sticks, and coarse salt. Stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat to medium-high and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until liquid is thick and syrupy and mixture is reduced to 7 cups, stirring frequently, about 55 minutes.

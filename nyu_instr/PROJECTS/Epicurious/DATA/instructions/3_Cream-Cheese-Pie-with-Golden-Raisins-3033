Preheat oven to 350°F. Lightly butter 10-inch-diameter glass pie dish. Mix crumbs and melted butter in small bowl. Press crumb mixture evenly over bottom and up sides (but not onto rim) of prepared dish. Refrigerate while preparing filling.
Blend cream cheese, 1/2 cup sugar and flour in processor until smooth. Add vanilla. Gradually pour in milk and process until smooth, occasionally scraping down sides of bowl. Add eggs; process until blended. Transfer batter to prepared crust. Mix remaining 2 tablespoons sugar with cinnamon in small bowl; sprinkle over filling. Carefully place raisins atop filling (some may sink).
Bake pie until set in center, about 1 hour. Transfer to rack and cool 1 hour. Refrigerate uncovered until cold, about 2 hours; cover and chill overnight.

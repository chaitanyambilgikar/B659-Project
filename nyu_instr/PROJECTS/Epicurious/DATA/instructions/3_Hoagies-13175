Halve the rolls horizontally, leaving on edge cut to form a hinge, spread the mayonnaise on the cut sides of the rolls, and on the bottom halves of the rolls layer the lettuce, the onion, the salami, the capicola, the provolone, and the tomato. In a small bowl whisk together the oil, the vinegar, the orégano, the cherry peppers, and salt and pepper to taste, drizzle the dressing over the fillings, and cover the fillings with the top halves of the rolls. Cut each sandwich in half.

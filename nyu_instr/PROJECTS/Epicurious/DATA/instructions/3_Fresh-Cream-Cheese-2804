Heat milk in heavy large saucepan over low heat until lukewarm (about 90°F. to 100°F.). Pour milk into large bowl. Stir in buttermilk. Cover with kitchen towel. Let stand at room temperature until mixture has formed a soft curd that resembles yogurt, about 24 hours.
Line large colander with clean muslin cloth. Set colander into sink. Pour in milk mixture and let drain 10 minutes. Fold cloth over curd to cover. Set colander on rack in deep bowl. Enclose bowl and colander in large plastic bag. Refrigerate until thick cheese forms, draining off liquid after 8 hours, about 24 hours. Transfer cheese to small container. Cover and store in refrigerator up to 4 days.

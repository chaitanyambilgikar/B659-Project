To each pound of ground beef add 1/2 cup of grated sharp Cheddar cheese, 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce and 1 grated onion. Season to taste with freshly ground pepper and form into cakes. Wrap each cake with a slice of bacon and grill as with plain hamburgers . These are exceptionally fine served with sliced raw onion marinated in an olive oil and wine vinegar dressing and plenty of hot mustard.

1. Boil a large pot of salted water.
2. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine all the ingredients except the flour. Blend well, then slowly stir in the flour until the mixture becomes a stiff batter.
3. Place a colander with large holes over the pot and, with a rubber spatula, press small amounts of the batter through the holes directly into the water.
4. As the spaetzle gradually rise to the surface of the boiling water, use a slotted spoon to transfer them to a serving dish. Serve immediately, while still warm.

1. Season the fillets with the salt and pepper and dredge them in the flour. Shake off any excess flour. Put half of the oil in a large sauté pan over high heat. When the oil is hot but not smoking, sauté the fish on one side for 3 minutes. Then flip and cook on the other side until just done, 1 to 2 minutes; the fillets should be golden brown and just cooked through. Transfer them to a platter and keep them warm in a 200°F oven while you make the sauce.
2. Add the remaining oil and the butter to a sauté pan and cook over high heat until the butter starts to foam. Add the shallot. Cook until it is golden and the butter is a pale hazelnut brown, about 1 minute. Add the orange juice and cook for 1 minute more. Add the lemon juice. When the butter mixture starts to foam again, remove the pan from heat. Season with more salt and pepper, if desired.
3. Put a piece of sole on each plate, drizzle with the brown butter, and serve immediately.

Combine 6 1/2 cups stock, black-eyed peas, bay leaves, 2 teaspoons thyme and 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper in heavy large saucepan. Bring to boil. Reduce heat; simmer uncovered until black-eyed peas are tender, adding more stock if necessary to keep peas submerged and stirring occasionally, about 1 1/4 hours. Drain well; discard broth and bay leaves. Transfer black-eyed peas to large bowl.
Bring 1 1/4 cups water to boil in heavy medium saucepan. Add rice and salt. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to low; cover and cook until rice is tender and water is absorbed, about 20 minutes. Transfer warm rice to bowl with black-eyed peas.
Whisk oil, vinegar, 1 teaspoon thyme and 1/4 teaspoon cayenne in small bowl. Add dressing to black-eyed pea mixture; toss. Stir in bell pepper and red onion. Season with salt and pepper. Chill at least 45 minutes and up to 6 hours.
Arrange lettuce on plates. Spoon salad into lettuce leaves and serve.

In a small dry heavy skillet toast fennel seeds over moderate heat, shaking skillet occasionally, until fragrant, about 3 minutes.
In a blender blend seeds, vinegar, oil, and salt and pepper to taste until emulsified.
In a large glass baking dish combine fennel marinade and all vegetables except lettuce leaves and marinate, covered and chilled, overnight.
Divide vegetables among lettuce leaves, letting excess marinade drip off, and roll up leaves to enclose vegetables. (Use wooden picks to secure lettuce cones if necessary.)

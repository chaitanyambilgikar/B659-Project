Heat olive oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add sausage, bell pepper, mushrooms and green onions. Sauté mixture until vegetables soften, about 7 minutes. Add pasta, pesto sauce and 1/2 cup Parmesan. Toss until mixture is combined. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Divide pasta mixture among plates. Pass additional Parmesan separately.

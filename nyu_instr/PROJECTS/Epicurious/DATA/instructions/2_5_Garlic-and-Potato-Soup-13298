In a heavy saucepan cook the garlic and the potatoes in the oil over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are pale golden, add the water and salt to taste, and simmer the mixture for 20 minutes, or until the potatoes are very soft. In a blender purée the soup in batches until it is smooth, transferring it as it is puréed to a bowl, and stir in the scallion and salt and pepper to taste.

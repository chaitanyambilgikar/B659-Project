Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 450°F.
Peel potatoes and cut into 3/4-inch cubes. Transfer potatoes to a 2 1/2-quart shallow baking dish and toss with oil, rosemary, salt, and pepper. Arrange potatoes in 1 layer and scatter bacon on top.
Bake until bacon is crisp and potatoes are cooked through and golden around edges, about 35 minutes. Loosen potatoes with a metal spatula before removing from dish.

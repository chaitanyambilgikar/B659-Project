Sterilize four 8-ounce Mason-type jars.
Quarter and pit plums and cut into 1/4-inch pieces. In a 2-quart heavy saucepan stir together plums and remaining ingredients and bring to a boil over moderate heat. Lower heat and simmer mixture, stirring occasionally, 15 minutes. Pour chutney into jars. Wipe rims with a dampened cloth and seal jars with lids. Put jars in a water-bath canner or on a rack set in a deep kettle. Cover jars with hot water by 2 inches and boil, covered, 5 minutes. Transfer jars with tongs to a rack and cool completely. Store chutney in a cool, dark place.

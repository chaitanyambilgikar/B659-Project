In medium bowl, whisk together soy sauce, sugar, rice wine, and five-spice powder.
Transfer fish to 2 rimmed plates. Drizzle each piece with 1 tablespoon soy sauce mixture and scatter with julienned ginger. (Set remaining sauce aside for finishing dish.) Cover and refrigerate 15 minutes.
Fit large saucepan with flat steamer basket, fill with 1 inch water, and bring to boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low and transfer 1 plate to steamer basket. Cover and steam 4 minutes. Without lifting lid, turn off flame and allow residual heat to finish cooking until fish is just cooked through, about 1 minute more. Carefully remove plate (keep warm in oven). Return water in steamer to boil, transfer second plate to steamer, and steam remaining fish in same manner.
While fish is steaming, in small saucepan over moderate heat, heat vegetable oil. Keep warm.
Divide fish among 4 plates and top with julienned scallions. Pour splash of hot oil over each dish. Serve immediately with bok choy.

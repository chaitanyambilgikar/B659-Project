1. Combine the mayonnaise with the tuna, parsley, capers, shallots, and anchovies. Whisk in enough olive oil (or water), a little at a time, to achieve a creamy consistency. Taste, and add salt and black pepper as necessary.
2. Lay out 4 slices bread. Top each with a thin layer of sauce; cover with a slice of turkey, then more sauce, then another slice of turkey, then finally more sauce and top layers of bread. Slice the sandwiches in half to display the interior layers, and serve.

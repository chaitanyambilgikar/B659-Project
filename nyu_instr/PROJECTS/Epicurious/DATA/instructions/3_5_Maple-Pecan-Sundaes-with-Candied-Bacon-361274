Preheat oven to 400°F. Line rimmed baking sheet with foil. Place rack in center of foil. Lay bacon slices on rack. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon maple sugar evenly over bacon. Bake until sugar is melted, about 8 minutes. Sprinkle remaining 1 tablespoon sugar over same side of bacon. Bake until bacon is deep brown and glazed, 12 to 14 minutes longer. Remove from oven.
Preheat broiler. Broil bacon until sugar on top bubbles thickly, watching closely to prevent burning, 1 to 2 minutes. Cool bacon completely on rack. Cut into 1/4-inch dice.
Combine maple syrup and cinnamon sticks in deep medium saucepan and bring to boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until sauce is thickened and reduced to 1/2 to 2/3 cup, about 5 minutes. Remove cinnamon sticks. Mix lemon juice and ginger into sauce. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.
Stir pecans and bacon into maple sauce. Scoop ice cream into dessert dishes. Spoon sauce over and serve.

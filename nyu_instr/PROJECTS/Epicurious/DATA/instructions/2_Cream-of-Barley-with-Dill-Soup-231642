Cook shallots in butter with 1/2 teaspoon salt in a 3-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Add barley and cook, stirring frequently, 1 minute. Add broth and 3 cups water and boil, covered, until barley is tender, about 10 minutes.
Pour broth through a medium-mesh sieve into a bowl and set aside half of barley mixture. Transfer broth and remaining barley mixture to a blender, then add 2 tablespoons sour cream and blend until very smooth (use caution when blending hot liquids). Return soup to saucepan, then stir in white pepper, remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, and remaining barley mixture.
Divide soup among serving bowls. Thin remaining tablespoon sour cream with remaining tablespoon water and drizzle over soup. Sprinkle with dill.

Rub the inside with lemon, sprinkle with salt and pepper and arrange on a well greased grill (or use a greased hinged grill). Cook on both sides to brown evenly and baste with melted butter and lemon juice or white wine. Fish cooks quickly. A small whole fish will only take 15 to 20 minutes. Larger ones take a half hour or more. Test with a fork or toothpick. The fish is cooked when the flesh flakes easily.
Serve with more melted butter and lemon juice or white wine, or with parsley butter. Fried potatoes and a crisp green salad or cucumber salad are excellent with fish dishes. Serve a fine dry white wine, chilled of course.

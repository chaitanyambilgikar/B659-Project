For Cake: Preheat oven to 350° F. Butter three 9-inch-diameter cake pans with 1 1/2-inch-high sides. Dust pans with flour. Sift first 6 ingredients into medium bowl. Blend Apricot Puree, pumpkin and buttermilk in small bowl. Using electric mixer, beat butter in large bowl until fluffy. Gradually add sugar, beating until well blended. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Mix in vanilla. Mix in dry ingredients alternately with pumpkin mixture, beginning and ending with dry ingredients. Divide batter equally among prepared pans. Smooth tops. Bake cakes until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 25 minutes (cakes will not rise to tops of pans).
For Frosting: Using electric mixer, beat cream cheese and sugar in medium bowl until fluffy. Add Apricot Puree, pumpkin and spices and beat until blended. Cut around pan sides to loosen cakes. Turn out cakes. Place 1 cake layer on platter. Spread 1 cup frosting over. Top with second cake layer. Spread 1 cup frosting over. Top with third cake layer. Spread remaining frosting over sides and top of cake. Garnish with dried apricot cutouts, if desired. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover with cake dome and refrigerate. Let stand at room temperature 1 hour before serving.)

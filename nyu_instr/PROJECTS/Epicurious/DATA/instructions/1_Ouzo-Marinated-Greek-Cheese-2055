Cut cheese lengthwise into four 1/2-inch-thick pieces. Arrange in single layer in shallow dish. Mix ouzo, oil, parsley, thyme and pepper in small bowl. Pour over cheese. Marinate at least 4 hours and up to 8 hours, turning once.
Preheat broiler. Remove cheese from marinade and transfer to 4 small broiler-proof gratin dishes. Drizzle 2 teaspoons marinade over each piece of cheese. Broil until cheese is soft and just begins to melt, about 4 minutes. Serve with bread.

In a bowl whisk together the flour, the cornmeal, the baking powder, and the salt. In a small bowl whisk together the butter, the egg, the honey, the sugar, and the milk, stir the butter mixture into the flour mixture, stirring until the batter is just combined, and fold in the blueberries. Divide the batter among 12 buttered 1/2-cup muffin tins, bake the muffins in the middle of a preheated 425°F. oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until they are golden and a tester comes out clean, and turn them out onto a rack.

Preheat oven to 375°F. Combine first 5 ingredients in 8-inch square baking dish. Pour 1/2 cup broth over vegetables. Bake until vegetables are very tender, about 40 minutes. Transfer mixture to processor and puree until smooth, adding additional broth as necessary to thin to sauce consistency.
Season to taste with salt. (Can be prepared 2 days ahead. Cover and refrigerate.) Bring sauce to simmer and serve.

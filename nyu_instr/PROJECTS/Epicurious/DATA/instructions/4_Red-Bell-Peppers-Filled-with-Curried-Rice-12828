In a heavy saucepan combine the rice, 1 1/2 cups water, and salt to taste, bring the water to a boil, and cook the rice, covered, over low heat for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the water is absorbed and the rice is tender. In a kettle of boiling salted water blanch the bell pepper halves for 4 minutes, plunge them into a bowl of ice and cold water to stop the cooking, and let them drain well on paper towels.
In a skillet cook the almonds in the butter over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until they begin to turn golden, add the curry powder, and cook the mixture, stirring, for 30 seconds. Add the raisins, the scallions, and 1/2 cup water and cook the mixture, stirring occasionally, until the liquid is reduced to about 1/3 cup. In a bowl combine well the rice, the almond mixture, the cayenne, and salt to taste, divide the mixture among the bell pepper halves, and serve the bell peppers at room temperature.

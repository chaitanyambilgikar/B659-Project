1. Mix together all the ingredients but the chicken in a large bowl. Divide the mixture between two resealable plastic bags. Make 4 or 5 deep slits in each piece of chicken and place the pieces in the bags. Coat the chicken well and marinate it overnight in the refrigerator.
2. Preheat oven to 500°F. Remove the chicken from the bags and blot it with paper towels to remove excess marinade. Place it in a roasting pan and roast for about 20 minutes, then turn the pieces over and roast for another 10 minutes, or until done.
3. Serve with white rice, along with naan bread, saag paneer, and samosas (all available frozen at Kalustyan's; frozen samosas are also sold at ethnicfoodsco.com). Fry the samosas according to the package directions on the morning of the party, then reheat them at 350°F for 6 to 8 minutes before serving. They taste best with mango or coriander chutney (available at Kalustyan's).

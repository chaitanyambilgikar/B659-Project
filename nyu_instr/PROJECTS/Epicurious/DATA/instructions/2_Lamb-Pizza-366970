1. Make the dough and let rise the first time as directed.
2. To make the topping, in a large, heavy frying pan, heat 1 tbsp of the oil over medium-high heat. Add the lamb and cook, breaking it up with a wooden spoon, until browned, about 8 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the lamb to a bowl, then discard the fat in the pan.
3. Return the pan to medium heat and add the remaining 1 tbsp oil. Add the onion and garlic and sauté until tender and lightly golden, about 8 minutes. Return the lamb to the pan, add the thyme and oregano, and cook, stirring occasionally, for 2–3 minutes. Add the tomatoes and stock and crush the tomatoes with a fork to release the flavor. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, uncovered, until most of the liquid has evaporated and the mixture is thick, about 45 minutes. Season with the salt and pepper. Remove from the heat and let cool completely.
4. Meanwhile, divide the dough into 4 equal pieces, shape each piece into a disk, and let rise for a second time as directed. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Dust 2 large rimmed baking sheets with cornmeal.
5. On a lightly floured work surface, roll out 1 dough disk into a round about 6 inches (15 cm) in diameter and 1/2 inch (12 mm) thick. Pinch around the edge to create a 1/2-inch (12-mm) rim, and place the round on one-half of a cornmeal-dusted baking sheet. Arrange one-fourth of the lamb mixture evenly over the crust, leaving the rim uncovered. Repeat to assemble the second pizza, placing it next to the first one on the other half of the baking sheet.
6. Bake until the dough is set and golden brown, 10–12 minutes. Meanwhile, assemble the remaining 2 pizzas on the second pan and slip them into the oven when the first batch is done. Cut all the pizzas into slices and serve.

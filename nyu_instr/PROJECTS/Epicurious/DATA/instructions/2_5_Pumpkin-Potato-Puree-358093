Peel potatoes and cut into 1-inch pieces, then put in a 3-quart saucepan with 2 teaspoon salt and enough cold water to cover by 1 inch. Simmer, uncovered, until tender, about 15 minutes.
Drain potatoes, then return to pot. Add butter and mash with a potato masher. Stir in pumpkin, warm milk, cheese, sage, vinegar, nutmeg, and 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and pepper.

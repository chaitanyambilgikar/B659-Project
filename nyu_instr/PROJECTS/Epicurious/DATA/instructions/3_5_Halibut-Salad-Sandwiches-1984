Preheat broiler. Season halibut with salt and pepper. Broil until just cooked through, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to plate; cool 10 minutes. Break halibut into small pieces.
Combine mayonnaise and next 5 ingredients in medium bowl and stir to blend. Mix in halibut. Season salad to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be made 6 hours ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
Arrange bottoms of rolls on plates. Mound salad over, dividing evenly. Top with lettuce, then with tops of rolls. Press sandwiches lightly to compact.

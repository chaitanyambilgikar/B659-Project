Trim any excess fat from the pork roast. Butterfly the roast by cutting horizontally through the center almost to the end, then opening the meat up like a book. If in doubt, ask your butcher to butterfly it for you. The meat should lie flat. Place the pork in a shallow dish.
Combine the remaining ingredients to make a jerk paste. Spread the paste all over the pork loin, cover, and refrigerate for 4 to 6 hours. Let the chilled meat come to room temperature before grilling.
Prepare a medium-hot fire in a charcoal grill or preheat a gas grill to 350°F. If you are using a charcoal grill, when the coals have burned down, rake them to the side. Set a drip pan in the center of the grill and arrange the coals around it to provide indirect heat. If you're using a gas grill, place the drip pan away from the burner.
Place the pork on the grill over the pan. Cook for about 2 hours, turning the meat once, or until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the center of the meat registers 155° to 165°F.
Cut the butterflied pork loin in half lengthwise. Cut into thin slices and serve.

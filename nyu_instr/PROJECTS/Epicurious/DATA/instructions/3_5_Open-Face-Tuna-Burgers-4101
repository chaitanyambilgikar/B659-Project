Arrange bread on 4 plates. Spread each slice with 1 tablespoon mayonnaise; then top each with lettuce and tomato.
Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add tuna patties and cook until firm to touch and heated through, about 4 minutes per side. Place tuna on tomato slices and serve.

Pat goose dry and prick all over with a fork. Season goose with salt and pepper. In a large heavy skillet (preferably cast-iron) brown goose in batches, without crowding, pouring off all but 2 tablespoons fat into a large heatproof bowl after each batch and reserving fat in bowl. Transfer goose as browned to a heavy 12 quart kettle.
In skillet cook 1/3 cup reserved goose fat and flour over moderately low heat, stirring constantly with a flat-edged metal or wooden spatula, until roux is the dark reddish-brown color of chestnut shells, about 45 minutes. (Alternatively, make Microwave Brown Roux and transfer to skillet.) Stir in onions, bell pepper, and celery and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are softened.
While roux is cooking bring goose, tasso or ham, tomatoes with juice, and water to a boil. Add roux mixture by large spoonfuls, stirring well after each addition, and simmer gumbo, covered, stirring occasionally, until goose is very tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Transfer goose with tongs to a large bowl and cook until it can be handled. Discard skin and bines and shred goose meat. Stir meat into gumbo with scallions, cayenne, and salt to taste. Gumbo may be make 3 days ahead, cooked completely, uncovered, and chilled, covered. Skim fat from gumbo. Reheat mixture if previously shilled.
Serve gumbo ladled over rice in large soup plates.

Stir together brown sugar, curry powder, and cayenne in a bowl until combined well.
Cook bacon in 2 batches in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat until some fat has rendered and edges begin to brown but bacon is still flexible, about 2 minutes per batch. Transfer bacon to paper towels to drain and cool.
Preheat broiler and lightly oil top rack of a broiler pan (do not line with foil).
Cut bacon slices in half crosswise. Divide sugar mixture among slices, spreading evenly and lightly pressing to help it adhere. Place 1 scallop half, cut side down, on each slice of sugar-coated bacon, then wrap bacon around scallop and secure with a toothpick. Transfer to oiled rack of a broiler pan.
Broil scallops, bacon side down, 4 to 5 inches from heat, turning over once, until bacon is browned and scallops are opaque, about 6 minutes total. Serve immediately.

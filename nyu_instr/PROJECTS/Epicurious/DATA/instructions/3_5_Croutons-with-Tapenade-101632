Finely chop 1 garlic clove in processor. Add olives, anchovies, capers, thyme and rosemary. Process until almost smooth. Add lemon juice. With machine running, gradually add 4 tablespoons olive oil. Blend mixture until smooth. Season tapenade to taste with pepper. Transfer to small bowl.
Preheat oven to 350°F. Arrange bread slices on 2 baking sheets. Bake bread until crisp and golden brown, about 15 minutes. Rub remaining 2 garlic cloves over 1 side of each crouton. Lightly brush croutons with remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. Serve croutons warm or at room temperature with tapenade. (Can be prepared 3 days ahead. Cover tapenade and refrigerate. Cool croutons completely; store in airtight container at room temperature.)

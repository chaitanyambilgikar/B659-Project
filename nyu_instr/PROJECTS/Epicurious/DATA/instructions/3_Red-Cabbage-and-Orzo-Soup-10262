In a saucepan cook the cabbage in the oil over moderate heat, stirring, until it is tender, stir in the broth and 1/2 cup water, and bring the mixture to a boil. Add the orzo, simmer the mixture, stirring occasionally, for 6 to 8 minutes, or until the orzo is tender, and add the soy sauce and pepper to taste. Divide the soup between bowls and top each serving with half the lemon slices and half the scallion greens.

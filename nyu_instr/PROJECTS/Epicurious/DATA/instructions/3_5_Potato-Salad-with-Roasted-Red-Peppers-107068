Steam potato slices just until tender, about 15 minutes. Transfer to large bowl. Drizzle with vinegar and lemon juice. Toss gently to coat. Cool to room temperature.
Combine next 5 ingredients in small bowl; whisk to blend. Pour dressing over cooled potatoes. Add red peppers. Toss gently to mix. Season potato salad to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)

Combine 2 cups hot water and raisins in small bowl. Soak raisins until softened, about 15 minutes. Drain water into large saucepan; reserve raisins. Add 2 tablespoons butter, wine, and saffron to pan; bring to boil. Stir in couscous. Cover, remove from heat, and let stand until liquid is absorbed, about 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in medium skillet over medium-low heat. Add onion; cover and cook until translucent and tender, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes. Mix onion, reserved raisins, almonds, and cinnamon into couscous. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve.

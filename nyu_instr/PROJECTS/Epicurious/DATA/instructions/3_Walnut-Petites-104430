Beat together cream cheese and butter with an electric mixer until smooth. Sift in flour and a pinch of salt and stir until mixture forms a dough. Divide dough into quarters, then chill, each wrapped in plastic wrap, at least 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 350°F.
Make 12 balls from each piece of dough. Press each ball into bottom and up sides of a mini-muffin cup to form a pastry shell. Chill until ready to fill.
Whisk together eggs, brown sugar, and a pinch of salt until blended, then stir in walnuts. Fill each pastry shell with 1 teaspoon filling.
Bake in batches in middle of oven until filling is bubbling and pastry is light brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Run a sharp knife around edges of pastries, then transfer to a rack and cool.

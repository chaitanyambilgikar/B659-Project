Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 400°F. Butter bottom and sides of baking pan, then sprinkle with bread crumbs, knocking out excess.
Whisk together flour and baking powder in a bowl. Whisk together eggs, oil, and milk in a large bowl, then stir in cheeses. Add flour mixture, stirring until incorporated (dough will be stiff).
Press dough evenly into pan, then smooth top with a spatula. Bake until golden and firm to the touch, about 25 minutes. Remove from heat and cool 10 minutes, turn bread onto a cutting board, then turn right side up. Cut into 24 bars (3 by 1 1/2 inches) and serve warm or at room temperature.

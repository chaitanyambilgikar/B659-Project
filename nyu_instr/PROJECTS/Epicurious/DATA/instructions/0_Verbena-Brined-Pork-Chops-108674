Bring all ingredients except pork to a boil in an 8- to 10-quart pot, then cool brine to room temperature. Add chops and chill in brine, covered, at least 8 hours. Remove chops from brine and rinse, then bring to room temperature (about 1 hour).
Prepare grill for cooking. If using a charcoal grill, open vents on bottom of grill, then light charcoal. Charcoal fire is medium hot when you can hold your hand 5 inches above rack for 3 to 4 seconds. If using a gas grill, preheat burners on high, covered, 10 minutes, then reduce heat to moderately high.
Pat chops dry. Grill chops on lightly oiled grill rack, turning over occasionally, until thermometer inserted horizontally into center of chops registers 150°F, 15 to 18 minutes total for charcoal or gas grill.
Transfer chops to a platter and let stand, covered loosely with foil, 10 minutes.

Combine goat cheese, chives and 1 tablespoon chopped parsley in small bowl; stir mixture to blend.
Using meat mallet or rolling pin, pound chicken breasts between sheets of waxed paper to scant 1/2-inch thickness, forming rectangles about 6 inches by 3 inches. Mound half of cheese mixture about 2 inches from 1 short end of each chicken piece. Fold short end over cheese mixture. Continue to roll up chicken, enclosing cheese mixture. Skewer packets closed with toothpicks. Sprinkle chicken generously with pepper.
Heat oil in heavy small skillet over medium heat. Add chicken to skillet and cook until light brown on all sides, about 8 minutes. Transfer chicken to plates. Increase heat and boil pan juices until reduced to 1/3 cup, about 2 minutes. Pour sauce over chicken. Sprinkle with remaining 1 tablespoon parsley and serve.

Preheat oven to 350°F. Combine cake mix, 1 egg, butter and pecans in medium bowl and mix to blend. Press mixture onto bottom of ungreased 13 x 9 x 2-inch glass baking dish. Beat sugar, cream cheese and sour cream in large bowl to blend. Mix in remaining 2 eggs, lemon peel and vanilla. Spread cheese evenly over crust.
Bake until cheese topping sets, about 30 minutes. Cool in pan on rack. Refrigerate until very cold, at least 3 hours. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and keep refrigerated.)
Cut into squares and serve cold.

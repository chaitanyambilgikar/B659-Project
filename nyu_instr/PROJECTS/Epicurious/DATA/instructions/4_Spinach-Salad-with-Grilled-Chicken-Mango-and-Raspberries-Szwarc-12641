Make dressing: In a bowl whisk together all dressing ingredients except oil. Add oil in a stream, whisking, and whisk until emulsified. (Dressing may be made 2 days ahead and chilled, covered.)
In a shallow dish or a resealable plastic bag coat chicken with 3 tablespoons dressing. (Marinate chicken, covered and chilled, 2 hours.)
Heat an oiled well-seasoned ridged grill pan over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and grill chicken, drained, until cooked through, about 7 minutes on each side. Transfer chicken to a platter and cool. (Chicken may be made up to this point 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.)
Cut chicken into 1/4-inch-thick slices and in a large bowl combine with remaining ingredients. Drizzle remaining dressing over salad and toss gently to combine well.

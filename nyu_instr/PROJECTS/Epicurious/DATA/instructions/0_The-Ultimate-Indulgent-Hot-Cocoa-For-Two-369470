Whisk together the cocoa, cornstarch, sugar, salt, and about 1/2 cup half-and-half in a small saucepan over medium-low heat until the cocoa and sugar are dissolved. Whisk in the rest of the half-and-half.
Bring it just to a boil over medium heat, whisking constantly, then reduce the heat and slowly simmer it 1 minute.
Stir in the vanilla and serve.

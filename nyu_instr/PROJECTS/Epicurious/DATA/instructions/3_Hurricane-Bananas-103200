Melt butter with oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderate heat, then stir in raisins, zest, brown sugar, ginger, cinnamon stick, and cloves until sugar is dissolved. Add bananas and cook, turning frequently, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes.
Stir together guava nectar, vinegar, and molasses and pour over bananas. Simmer, stirring gently, until sauce is thickened, about 30 seconds. Discard cinnamon stick and cloves and serve bananas warm.

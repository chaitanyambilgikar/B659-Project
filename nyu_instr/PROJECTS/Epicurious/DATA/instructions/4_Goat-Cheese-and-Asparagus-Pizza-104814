Preheat oven to 400°F. Toss asparagus with oil in medium bowl to coat. Unroll pizza dough on baking sheet, forming 9x12-inch rectangle. Spoon tomatoes over dough, leaving 3/4-inch plain border. Scatter asparagus with oil over tomatoes. Bake pizza 7 minutes. Remove from oven. Crumble goat cheese over pizza. Sprinkle with marjoram and crushed pepper. Bake until crust is golden around edges, about 9 minutes longer.

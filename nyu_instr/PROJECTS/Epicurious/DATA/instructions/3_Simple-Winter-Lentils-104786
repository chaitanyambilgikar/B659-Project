1. Place the lentils in a large saucepan or stockpot. Add the onion, the bay leaves and the carrot and cover by at least 2 inches with water. Bring to a boil, cover, reduce the heat so the lentils are simmering and cook until they are al dente, checking to be sure that they don't cook dry and adding hot water if necessary. Remove the lentils from the heat and season them with salt and pepper. If they are very soupy, drain them. Transfer them to a warmed bowl, and stir in the oil. Season to taste and serve.

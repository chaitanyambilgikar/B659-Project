Peel potatoes. In a saucepan cover potatoes with cold water by 2 inches and simmer, covered, until very tender but not falling apart, about 20 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350°F.
While potatoes are cooking, trim Brussels sprouts. With a paring knife cut 4 firm cup-shaped leaves from stem end of each sprout and reserve. Quarter rest of each sprout and slice thin.
With a slotted spoon transfer potatoes to a colander and drain, reserving cooking water in pan, and transfer potatoes to a bowl. Add butter, salt, and pepper and with an electric mixer beat mixture until smooth.
Have ready a bowl of ice and cold water and bring reserved cooking water to boil. Gently stir in reserved sprout leaves and blanch 5 seconds. Working quickly, with a skimmer or slotted spoon transfer leaves to bowl of ice and cold water. Blanch shredded sprouts 30 seconds and drain in a sieve. Beat shredded sprouts into potato purée.
Transfer leaves to paper towels to drain upside down. Transfer purée to a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch plain tip and pipe into upturned leave cups. Arrange filled leaf cups in a buttered shallow baking dish. Hors d'oeuvres may be prepared 3 hours ahead and chilled, covered. Sprinkle tops of hors d'oeuvres with bacon and heat in middle of oven 3 minutes, or until heated through.

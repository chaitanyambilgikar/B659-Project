In a 10-inch skillet sauté leeks in oil over moderately high heat, turning, until golden, about 10 minutes. Stir in wine and 1/2 cup broth and cook leeks, covered, turning occasionally, until tender when pierced, about 10 minutes. Transfer leeks to a serving plate.
Whisk remaining 2 tablespoons broth and vinegar into skillet and boil, stirring, until thickened slightly. Remove skillet from heat and whisk in mustard and salt and pepper to taste. Pour vinaigrette over leeks.

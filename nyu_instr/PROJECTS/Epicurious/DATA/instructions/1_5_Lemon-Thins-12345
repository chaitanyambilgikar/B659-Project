In a bowl with an electric mixer cream the butter with the brown sugar and the zest until the mixture is light and fluffy and beat in the yolk, the lemon juice, the vanilla, and the salt. Add the flour, sifted, and beat the mixture until it is just combined well. Drop teaspoons of the batter 2 inches apart onto well-buttered baking sheets and bake the cookies in batches in the middle of a preheated 350°F. oven for 8 to 10 minutes, or until they are golden around the edges. Let the cookies cool on the sheet for 1 minute, or until they are just firm enough to be removed, and transfer them to racks to cool.

Cut tenderloin into 1-inch pieces. Place 1 piece between 2 sheets of waxed paper. Pound turkey with mallet or small heavy flat-bottomed saucepan until flattened to thickness of 1/4 inch. Repeat with remaining tenderloin. Sprinkle lemon juice over turkey. Cover and refrigerate 10 minutes.
Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add turkey in batches and fry until just cooked, turning once, about 4 minutes. Transfer turkey to plate; cover with foil and keep warm. Add onion and garlic to skillet and sauté until tender, about 4 minutes. Stir in wine and simmer until wine is reduced to glaze, about 1 minute. Add broth, tomatoes, basil and lemon peel. Cover and simmer until slightly thickened, approximately 3 minutes. Pour sauce over turkey and serve.

Melt butter in small saucepan over medium heat; sprinkle with salt. Pour half of butter into small bowl and reserve. Add chopped sage to remaining melted butter in saucepan; stir over medium heat 30 seconds.
Arrange 8 bread slices on work surface. Brush top side with all of melted sage butter. Divide Fontina cheese among bread slices; sprinkle Parmesan over each, dividing equally. Sprinkle with freshly ground black pepper. Top with remaining 8 bread slices, pressing to adhere. Brush top side of sandwiches with some of reserved plain melted butter. Press 4 whole sage leaves atop each sandwich to adhere.
Heat 2 heavy large skillets over medium heat. Place 4 sandwiches, sage-leaf side down, in each skillet and cook until golden brown on bottom, 4 to 5 minutes. Brush top of sandwiches with remaining plain melted butter; turn sandwiches over and cook until golden brown on bottom and cheese melts, about 4 minutes. Transfer sandwiches, sage-leaf side up, to cutting board. Cut each sandwich into 4 pieces (each mini sandwich should contain 1 whole sage leaf). Transfer to platter and serve.

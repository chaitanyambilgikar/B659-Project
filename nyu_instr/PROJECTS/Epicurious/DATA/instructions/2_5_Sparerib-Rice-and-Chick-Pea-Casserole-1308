Preheat oven to 350°F. Season spareribs with salt and pepper. Brown spareribs in heavy large Dutch oven over high heat. Transfer ribs to plate. Add onion and garlic to pot and sauté until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add all remaining ingredients except pimientos to pot. Bring to boil, scraping up browned bits. Return ribs and any collected juices to pot. Push ribs into rice mixture. Season with salt and pepper. Spread pimientos evenly over top. Cover pot and bake until meat and rice are tender and all liquids are absorbed about 50 minutes.

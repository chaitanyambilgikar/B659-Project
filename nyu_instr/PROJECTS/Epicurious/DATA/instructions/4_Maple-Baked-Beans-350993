1. In a large pan, cover the beans with water. Bring to a boil and simmer until tender, about 1 hour.
2. Preheat oven to 300°F.
3. In a bowl, combine everything else except the bacon. Stir in the beans.
4. Place 1 bacon strip at the bottom of a large ovenproof dish or Dutch oven. Pour the bean mixture over it, then push the other strip in.
5. Add just enough boiling water to the pot to cover everything.
6. Cover the pot with aluminum foil, then a lid. Bake for 5 hours, checking hourly to make sure the beans aren’t drying out. (Add more water as necessary to keep them submerged.) 7 Uncover for the last half hour to brown the top, if desired.

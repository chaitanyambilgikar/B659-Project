Cook sugar in a dry 2-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat, undisturbed, until it begins to melt. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally with a fork, until sugar is melted into a deep golden caramel.
Tilt pan and carefully pour in water, then cream and rum (mixture will bubble up and steam vigorously). Cook over moderately low heat, stirring, until caramel is dissolved. Stir in pecans and serve sauce warm.

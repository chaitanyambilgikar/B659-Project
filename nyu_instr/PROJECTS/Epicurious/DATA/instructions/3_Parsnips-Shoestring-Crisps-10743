In a food processor fitted with the fine julienne disk cut the parsnips lengthwise into strips. In a kettle fry the parsnips, a handful at a time, in 1 1/2 inches of 375°F. oil for 1 minute, or until they are golden brown, and transfer them with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain. In a small bowl combine well the celery salt, the dill, and the pepper and sprinkle the mixture over the parsnip crisps.

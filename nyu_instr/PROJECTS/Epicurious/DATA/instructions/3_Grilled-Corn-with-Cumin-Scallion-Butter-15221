In a dry small heavy skillet toast seeds over moderate heat, shaking skillet, until fragrant, about 1 minute, and cool. In an electric coffee/spice grinder finely grind seeds and salt. Finely chop enough scallion greens to measure 1/3 cup. In a saucepan melt butter with cumin salt, stirring, and stir in scallion greens and lemon juice. Cool butter.
While butter is cooling, peel back husks from corn, leaving them attached at base of ears, and discard silk. Brush kernels with some butter and reassemble husks over ears. Chill remaining butter, covered. Peel off a few layers of husks and tear lengthwise into narrow strips. Tie ends of reassembled ears with strips of husks. Corn may be prepared 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.
Prepare grill.
Grill corn on a rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals, turning it occasionally, 20 minutes. (Alternatively, in a shallow baking pan roast corn in middle of a preheated 450°F. oven, turning it occasionally, 35 minutes.) Reheat remaining cumin scallion butter.
Serve corn with melted butter.

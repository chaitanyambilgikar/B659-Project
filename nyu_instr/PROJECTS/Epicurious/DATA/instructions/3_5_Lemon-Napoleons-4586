Make curd: Whisk sugar, eggs and yolks in heavy medium saucepan to blend. Mix in lemon juice, butter and peel. Whisk over medium-low heat until mixture thickens and just begins to bubble at edges, about 6 minutes (do not boil). Transfer to small bowl. Press plastic wrap directly onto surface of curd. Chill until cold,at least 2 hours. (Can be made 3 days ahead. Keep chilled.)
Make phyllo pastries: Position 1 rack in bottom third and 1 rack in center of over; preheat to 375°F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Mix 2 tablespoons sugar and cinnamon in bowl.
Place 1 phyllo sheet on work surface (cover remaining phyllo with plastic and damp cloth). Brush phyllo with butter; sprinkle with 1 teaspoon cinnamon sugar. Top with second phyllo sheet. Brush with gutter; sprinkle with 1 teaspoon cinnamon sugar. Repeat layering with remaining 4 phyllo sheets, butter and cinnamon sugar. Trim phyllo stack to 12 inches wide by 18 inches long. Cut stack into four 3-inch-wide by 18-inch-long strips. Cut each strip into six 3-inch squares, forming twenty-four squares. Transfer to baking sheets.
Bake phyllo squares 6 minutes. Switch sheets on racks and bake until deep golden brown,about 4 minutes longer. Cool pastries on baking sheets.

Preheat oven to 425°F. Let refrigerated pie crusts stand at room temperature 15 to 20 minutes. Combine raspberries, rhubarb, diced pears, 2 1/3 cups sugar, 3/4 cup all purpose flour, grated orange peel and 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon in large bowl. Mix gently.
Unfold 2 pie crusts. Press out fold lines. Sprinkle each crust with 1 teaspoon flour; spread flour over. Place each crust floured side down in separate 10-inch-diameter pie dishes oe 9-inch diameter deep-dish pie dishes. Divide fruit filling between crusts. Press out fold lines in remaining 2 crusts. Arrange atop pies. Fold edges of top crusts under bottom crusts. Press edges together and crimp. Cut eight 1 1/2-inch-long slits in each top crust, radiating from near center.
Brush pies with egg glaze. Sprinkle with sugar. Bake until golden brown and filling bubbles, covering edges with foil after 30 minutes, about 1 hour. Cool pies completely. Serve pies with vanilla ice cream.

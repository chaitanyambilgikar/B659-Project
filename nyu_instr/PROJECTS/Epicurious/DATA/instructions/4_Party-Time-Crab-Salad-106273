1. Combine the crabmeat and cucumber in a bowl. Carefully toss together with the lime juice and olive oil. Add the slivered basil, salt, and pepper; combine gently, trying not to break up the crabmeat.
2. Mound the crabmeat equally in the center of 6 dinner plates. Top each serving with 2 tablespoons of Mango and Mint Salsa . Sprinkle with chopped mint and place a sprig of basil or mint alongside each salad.

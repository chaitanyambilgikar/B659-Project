Bring wine, garlic, and crushed red pepper to boil in heavy extra-large pot. Add clams. Cover and cook until clams open, about 9 minutes. Using slotted spoon or tongs, transfer clams to 4 large bowls (discard any clams that do not open). Stir tomatoes and pesto into pot and bring to simmer. Ladle pesto broth over clams and serve.

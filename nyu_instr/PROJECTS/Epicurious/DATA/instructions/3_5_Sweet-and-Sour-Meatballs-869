Pour tomatoes with their juices into heavy large Dutch oven. Using potato masher, crush tomatoes. Add broth, 1/2 cup onion, brown sugar, half of garlic and 1 tablespoon lemon juice. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer sauce while preparing meatballs.
Combine beef, breadcrumbs, salt, pepper, allspice, remaining 1 cup onion and remaining garlic in large bowl. Add eggs; blend well. Shape mixture into 1-to 1 1/2-inch balls. Gently drop meatballs into simmering sauce. Partially cover pot and simmer over very low heat until meatballs are cooked through and tender and sauce is thick, about 1 hour 20 minutes. Spoon off any fat from top of sauce. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Cover; chill. Rewarm over low heat before serving.)

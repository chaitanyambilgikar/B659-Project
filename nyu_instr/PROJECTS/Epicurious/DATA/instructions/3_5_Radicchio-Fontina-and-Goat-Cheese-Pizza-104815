Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 425°F. Whisk olive oil and finely chopped garlic in large bowl to blend. Add radicchio strips, grated Fontina, sliced fennel and roasted red peppers and toss to coat; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place crust on rimless baking sheet. Mound radicchio mixture on crust, leaving 3/4-inch plain border. Top with crumbled goat cheese. Bake pizza until crust is crisp and topping is heated through, about 13 minutes. Top pizza with Parmesan shavings, if desired. Cut pizza into slices and serve.

Spread the bread with the butter, cut it into twelve 2-inch squares, and on it arrange decoratively the tomatoes, the olives, and the shrimp.
In a small bowl combine well the mayonnaise and the horseradish, dot the shrimp with the mixture, and garnish it with the dill.
The canapés may be made 30 minutes in advance and kept covered and chilled. Arrange the canapés on a platter.

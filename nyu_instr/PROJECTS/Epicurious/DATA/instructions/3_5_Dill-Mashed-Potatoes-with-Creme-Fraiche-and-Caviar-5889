Cook potatoes in large pot of boiling salted water until very tender, about 25 minutes. Drain well. Return potatoes to pot; mash over low heat until almost smooth. Add crème fraîche and butter; whisk until smooth and fluffy. Stir in dill. Season with salt and pepper. (Potatoes can be made 2 hours ahead. Cover and let stand at room temperature. Rewarm over low heat, stirring frequently.)
Top potatoes with caviar and serve.

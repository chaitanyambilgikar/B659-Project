Cut out four 14x6-inch strips of foil. Fold each lengthwise in half. Wrap 1 around each of four 2/3-cup soufflé dishes. Secure with tape if necessary. Whisk first 4 ingredients in medium metal bowl. Set bowl over saucepan of simmering water (do not allow bottom of bowl to touch water) and whisk until thermometer registers 140°F for 3 consecutive minutes, about 10 minutes. Remove from over water. Using electric mixer, beat until cool, about 4 minutes.
Using electric mixer fitted with clean dry beaters, beat cream in large bowl until stiff peaks form. Fold Grand Marnier mixture into cream.
Divide soufflé mixture among prepared dishes. Freeze at least 4 hours or overnight.
Remove foil collars from soufflés. Serve, passing Bittersweet Chocolate Sauce separately.

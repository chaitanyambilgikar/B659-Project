Cut off the stems of the artichokes with a stainless-steel knife, break off the tough outer leaves, and cut off the top fourth of each artichoke. Snip off the tips of the remaining artichoke leaves with scissors and rub the cut edges with the lemon half. Arrange the artichokes upright in a microwave-safe dish, add 1 inch water and the garlic, and cover the dish tightly with microwave-safe plastic wrap. Microwave the artichokes at high power (100%) for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the bases are tender.
While the artichokes are cooking, in a blender blend together 3 tablespoons warm water, the vinegar, the orégano, the saffron, the sugar, and the oil. Transfer the cooked artichokes to 2 plates. Peel the garlic, in the blender purée it with the vinegar mixture until the mixture is smooth, and stir in the parsley and salt and pepper to taste. Transfer the sauce to a bowl and serve it with the artichokes.

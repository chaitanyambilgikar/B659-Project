Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add onion and sauté 3 minutes. Add anchovies, garlic and dried red pepper; sauté 2 minutes. Mix in tomatoes with juices, clams with juices, wine and tomato paste. Bring sauce to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until slightly thickened, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.
Add linguine to sauce and toss to coat. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to large bowl. Sprinkle with parsley. Serve with Parmesan cheese, if desired.

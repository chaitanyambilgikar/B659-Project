1. Fill a large bowl with water, squeeze the half lemon into it, and then add the lemon half as well, Peel the potatoes and the Jerusalem artichokes, placing them directly in the acidulated water.
2. Bring plain water to a boil in the bottom of a vegetable steamer. Place the celery root in the top and cook until it begins to turn tender, 10 minutes. Add the potatoes and cook until the celery root is nearly tender through, 10 minutes. Then add the Jerusalem artichokes and cook until they are tender through, about 10 minutes.
3. Transfer the vegetables to a large bowl, of to the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the dough blade, and blend to a consistent but slightly chunky purée (do not puré them in a food processor or they will turn to glue). Add the butter and continue mixing until it is incorporated. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and serve piping hot.

Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350°F. Line 2 heavy large baking sheets with foil. Butter foil and dust with flour. Finely grind almonds, sugar, cinnamon and salt in processor. Add egg, egg white and almond extract and process until mixture holds together. Transfer to bowl. Stir in chocolate.
Using moistened hands, roll mixture into 1-inch balls and place on prepared sheets. Flatten to 1/3-inch thick rounds. Bake macaroons until tops puff and centers are still soft, about 12 minutes. Transfer to rack and cool completely. Store in airtight container at room temperature. (Can be prepared 3 days ahead.)

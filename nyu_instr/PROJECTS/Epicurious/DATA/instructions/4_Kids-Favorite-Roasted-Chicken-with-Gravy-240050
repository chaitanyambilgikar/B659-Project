1. Preheat oven to 400°F. Mix the butter, garlic, and thyme in a bowl with a spoon until soft.
2. Carefully, using your fingers, peel the skin away from the chicken breast and rub the butter mixture under the skin. Rub the outside of the skin with the canola oil and season with the salt and pepper.
3. Place the chicken in a roasting pan and roast in the oven for 1 hour. Remove, take the chicken out of the roasting pan, and let it rest on a plate while you make the gravy.
4. Put the roasting pan on a burner over low heat, sprinkle in the flour, and stir to incorporate any liquid in the pan.
5. Gradually add the chicken stock, stirring constantly. Transfer the gravy into a small pot, and simmer over low heat until it has the preferred consistency.
6. Add additional salt and pepper to taste and strain the gravy through a fine mesh sieve before pouring it onto the chicken (which will have released some juice onto the plate by now).

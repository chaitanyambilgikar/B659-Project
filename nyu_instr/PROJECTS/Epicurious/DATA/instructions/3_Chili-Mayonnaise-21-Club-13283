In a small heatproof bowl cover chilies with boiling water and soak 30 minutes. Drain chilies and purée in a food mill fitted with fine disk or a food processor. If using a food processor, force purée through a sieve. Paste may be made 2 weeks ahead and chilled, covered. Stir chili paste into mayonnaise until combined well.

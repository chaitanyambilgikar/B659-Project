In a food processor grind fine the whole almonds with the sugar, the almond extract, and the salt. In a bowl beat the whites until they are foamy (just before they hold soft peaks) and fold in the almond mixture gently but thoroughly. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper and butter the parchment. Transfer the batter to a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch plain tip, pipe 1-inch mounds onto the parchment, 2 inches apart, and sprinkle them with the sliced almonds. Bake the macaroons in the middle of a preheated 300°F. oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until they are golden around the edges, and let them cool on the parchment. Peel the macaroons from the parchment and store them in an airtight container.

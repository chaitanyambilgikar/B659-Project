Preheat oven to 500°F with rack in lower third.
Toss green beans with cashews, shallots, oil, and 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper, then spread evenly in a large 4-sided sheet pan.
Roast, stirring occasionally, until green beans are tender and nuts are golden brown, about 25 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.

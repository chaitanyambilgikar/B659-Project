Preheat oven to 300°F. Combine old-fashioned oats, flour, golden brown sugar, almonds, walnuts, milk powder, sunflower seeds and salt in 13x9x2-inch metal baking pan. Whisk vegetable oil, 1/2 cup water, honey, vanilla extract and maple extract in medium bowl to blend. Add to dry ingredients in pan and stir to coat well. Bake until granola is golden and crunchy, stirring frequently, about 45 minutes. Cool completely. (Granola can be prepared up to 2 weeks ahead. Store in airtight container at room temperature.)

Grind the oranges and 1/2 lemon in a meat grinder, using the coarsest blade. Combine all the ingredients, except the nuts, in a large pot. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly until the sugar is dissolved. Cook over medium heat until the conserve thickens. Remove from heat, stir in nuts and pour into hot, sterilized jelly glasses. Cover with a thin layer of melted paraffin. When hardened, cover glasses and store.

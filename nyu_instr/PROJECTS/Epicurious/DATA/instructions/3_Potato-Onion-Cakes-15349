Boil potatoes in large pot of water just until centers can be pierced with sharp knife, about 20 minutes. Drain. Cover and refrigerate until well chilled. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.)
Peel potatoes. Using hand grater, coarsely grate potatoes into large bowl. Gently mix in green onions. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Beat eggs with cumin and gently mix into potato mixture. Form potatoes into 2 1/2-inch-diameter cakes (about 1 inch thick). Cover and refrigerate until ready to cook. (Can be prepared 6 hours ahead.)
Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add potato cakes in batches and fry until golden brown, about 8 minutes per side, adding more oil as necessary.

Place colander over large bowl. Line colander with kitchen towel. Toss 1/3 of spinach in heavy Dutch oven over high heat until wilted but still bright green, about 3 minutes. Transfer spinach to prepared colander. Repeat with remaining spinach in 2 batches. Let spinach cool briefly. Gather towel around spinach and squeeze well, pressing out as much liquid as possible. (Can be prepared 8 hours ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
Heat olive oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add chopped garlic, olives and raisins and sauté until garlic begins to color, about 3 minutes. Add spinach and toasted pine nuts and toss until heated through. Add vinegar and toss. Season spinach generously with salt and pepper and serve.

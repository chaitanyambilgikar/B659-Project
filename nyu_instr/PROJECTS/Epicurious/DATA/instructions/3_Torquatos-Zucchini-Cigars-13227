In a large heavy non-stick skillet combine zucchini and 1 tablespoon oil, shaking skillet to coat zucchini completely with oil. Cook zucchini over moderate heat, shaking skillet occasionally, until browned evenly, 20 to 25 minutes.
Transfer zucchini to a platter and sprinkle with basil and salt and pepper. Drizzle zucchini with remaining 1 to 2 tablespoons oil and serve hot or at room temperature.

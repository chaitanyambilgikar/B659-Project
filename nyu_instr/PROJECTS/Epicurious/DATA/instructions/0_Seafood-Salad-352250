Combine dressing ingredients with 6 tablespoons water in a blender. Coat grill or grill pan with cooking spray and heat over medium-high heat. Lightly coat octopus with cooking spray and sprinkle with salt, chili powder and black pepper. Grill octopus, turning occasionally, until meat is white, 8 to 10 minutes. Roughly chop octopus on the diagonal. Toss octopus in a bowl with vegetables, olives, mint and juice. Transfer to a platter and serve with dressing and pita on the side.

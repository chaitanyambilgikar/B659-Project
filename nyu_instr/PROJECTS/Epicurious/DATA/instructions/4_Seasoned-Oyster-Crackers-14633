In a large bowl whisk together oil, dressing mix, and lemon pepper seasoning. Add oyster crackers and toss until coated well. Spread oyster crackers on a double thickness of paper towels to absorb excess oil and let stand 30 minutes. Transfer crackers to an airtight container and let stand at room temperature at least 8 hours (to develop flavor) and up to 1 week.

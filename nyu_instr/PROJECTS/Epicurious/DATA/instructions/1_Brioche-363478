To knead by hand: Mix together all the dough ingredients in a large bowl to form a dough. Knead for about 10 minutes, until smooth and shiny.
Or, to use a stand mixer: Fit the dough hook and add all the dough ingredients to the mixer bowl. Mix on low speed until combined and mix for about 10 minutes, until smooth and shiny.
Shape the dough into a round, place in a bowl, and cover tightly. Leave in the fridge overnight.
The next day, divide the dough into 2 pieces and form into the shape of your choice. Lightly flour the loaves, lay them on a wooden board or linen cloth, and cover with a plastic bag. Leave them somewhere nice and warm to proof until almost doubled in size; this could take 3 or 4 hours, as the dough is cold.
Preheat the oven to 400°F. For the glaze, beat the egg and milk together. Transfer the risen loaves to a baking sheet and brush all over with the glaze. Bake for about 10 minutes, then lower the oven setting to 350°F and bake for a further 30 minutes, or until golden brown. Let cool on a wire rack.

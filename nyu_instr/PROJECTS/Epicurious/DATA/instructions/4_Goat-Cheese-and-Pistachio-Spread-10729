In a bowl with an electric mixer beat together the goat cheese, the butter, the garlic paste, the pistachio nuts, the sliced chives, and salt and pepper to taste until the mixture is combined well, spoon the spread into a serving dish, and chill it, its surface covered with plastic wrap, overnight. The spread may be made 2 days in advance and kept covered and chilled. Garnish the spread with the chive blades and serve it with the toasts.

Place beans in large saucepan. Add enough cold water to cover by 3 inches and let soak overnight.
Drain beans and return to pan. Add 6 cups cold water, 1/4 cup oil, chopped sage and garlic. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low. Cover partially; simmer until beans are just tender, stirring occasionally, about 45 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cool. Cover and keep chilled. Rewarm before continuing.)
Using slotted spoon, transfer beans to bowl. Top with more oil.

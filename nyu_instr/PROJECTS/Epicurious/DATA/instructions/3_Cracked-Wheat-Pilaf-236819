Heat the oil in a 3-quart saucepan over moderate heat until it shimmers and cook the cloves, cinnamon, cumin seeds, bay leaf, and turmeric (if using), stirring and shaking the pan, until the spices are fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the onion and ginger and cook until the onion is translucent, 2 to 3 minutes longer. Add the chicken stock, then bring to a boil over high heat. Stir in the cracked wheat and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and return the mixture to a boil.
Remove from the heat and let the pilaf stand for 30 minutes. Remove the cloves, cinnamon, and bay leaf and fluff the pilaf with a fork and season with salt to taste before serving.

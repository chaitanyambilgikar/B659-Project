Bring broth, rice and saffron to boil in heavy medium saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer 15 minutes. Place frozen peas atop rice mixture. Cover and cook until rice is tender, peas are cooked through and broth is absorbed, about 4 minutes longer. Meanwhile, heat heavy large skillet over high heat. Add ham and bell pepper and cook until ham begins to brown, stirring frequently, about 5 minutes.
Remove skillet from heat. Add rice mixture, tomatoes and 2 tablespoons vinaigrette. Toss, adding more vinaigrette by tablespoonfuls if mixture is dry. Season with salt and pepper. Serve warm or at room temperature.

Sauté 2 tablespoons corned beef fat and bay leaves in large saucepan over medium-high heat until fat renders, about 2 minutes. Stir in parsnips and onions. Add 3 cups broth. Cover; simmer until parsnips are tender, about 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, cut cabbage and corned beef slices crosswise into very thin strips. Melt 1 tablespoon fat in medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add cabbage and corned beef. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Toss until cabbage wilts, about 3 minutes.
Working in batches, puree soup with bay leaves and cream in blender until smooth. Return to same pan. Rewarm soup, thinning with more broth if too thick. Season with salt and pepper. Ladle into bowls. Mound corned beef and cabbage in center.

In a 5-quart heavy-duty Dutch oven, heat 1 tablespoon of the butter and 1 tablespoon of the oil over medium heat. Add the leek, scallions, and garlic, and sauté, stirring occasionally, until just tender, about 5 minutes. Add the spinach, parsley, and dill, and stir constantly until the greens are just wilted. Remove the Dutch oven from the heat and set it aside.
In a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat, add the remaining butter and olive oil. When hot, add the lamb, a few pieces at a time, and brown on all sides. Season with salt and pepper, and transfer the lamb to the Dutch oven with the greens. The meat may be seared in 2 batches.
Add the turmeric to the same skillet and stir for a few seconds, Add the chicken broth, scraping up any brown bits, and bring to a boil. Pour over the meat and greens mixture. Cover the Dutch oven, bring to a boil over medium heat, then turn the heat to low. Add the lemon juice and zest and simmer for 1 hour.
Stir in the cooked beans and continue to simmer 10 to 15 minutes more, until the beans are hot and the meat is tender. Spoon over a bed of orzo or rice if you wish.

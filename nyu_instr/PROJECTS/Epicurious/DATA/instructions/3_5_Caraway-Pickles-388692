Place cucumbers in a stainless-steel or heatproof glass container; set aside.
Bring sugar, all remaining ingredients, and 1/2 cup water just to a boil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring until sugar and salt are completely dissolved. Let cool for 10 minutes.
Pour pickling liquid over cucumbers. Cover and chill overnight or up to 3 days.

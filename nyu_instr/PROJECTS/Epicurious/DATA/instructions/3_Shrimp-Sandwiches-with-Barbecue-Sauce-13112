In a large non-stick skillet heat oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and sauté shrimp with salt and pepper to taste 2 to 3 minutes, or until just cooked through. Transfer shrimp with a slotted spoon as cooked to a plate and cool. Cut each shrimp in half horizontally and in a bowl toss with mayonnaise and salt and pepper to taste.
In a small bowl whisk together ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, and Tabasco and spread evenly on cut sides of buns. Make sandwiches on buns with shrimp and coleslaw.

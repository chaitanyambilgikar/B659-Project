Melt butter in a shallow, heavy pan set on a heat diffuser over low heat, or in a bain-marie. Break eggs into a bowl and beat very lightly with a fork. Tip into the pan with the hot, melted butter and stir.
Cook over low heat, stirring gently and more or less constantly with a wooden spoon.
It will take 3 to 4 minutes for the eggs to become just set, but very creamy. (If using a bain-marie, allow about 6 minutes.) If you prefer firmer, dryer scrambled eggs, cook for another 2 minutes.
When the eggs are scrambled to your liking, add 2 tbsp light or heavy cream or a little bit of butter, and season with salt and pepper. Scrambled eggs are best served immediately.

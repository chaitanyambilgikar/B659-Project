In a large saucepan combine the potatoes, peeled and cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces, and the parsnips with salted cold water to cover, bring the water to a boil, and simmer the vegetables, covered, for 20 to 25 minutes, or until they are very tender. Drain the vegetables, reserving 1 cup of the cooking liquid, and force them through the medium disk of a food mill or a ricer into a large bowl. Add the butter, stirring until it is melted, and stir in the white pepper, salt to taste, and enough of the reserved cooking liquid to achieve the desired consistency. The purée may be made 2 days in advance, kept covered and chilled, and reheated.

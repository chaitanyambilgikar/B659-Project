Remove tough muscle from side of each scallop if necessary and halve any large scallops. Pat scallops dry with paper towels and in a bowl toss with salt and thyme. In a large non-stick skillet cook bacon over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until crisp and with a slotted spoon transfer to paper towels to drain. Increase heat to moderately high and in drippings remaining in skillet sear scallops, stirring occasionally, until golden and cooked through. With slotted spoon transfer scallops to a clean bowl.
In same skillet heat oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and sauté scallions, stirring occasionally, until they begin to brown, about 1 minute. Add corn and tomatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, until corn begins to brown, about 3 minutes. Return scallops to skillet and heat through, seasoning mixture with salt and pepper.
Serve scallops sprinkled with bacon.

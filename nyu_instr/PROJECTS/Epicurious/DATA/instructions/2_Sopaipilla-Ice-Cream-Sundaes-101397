Cut 4 tortillas in half, then crosswise into thin strips. Cut remaining 4 tortillas into quarters. Add enough oil to heavy medium skillet to reach depth of 1/2 inch. Heat oil over medium heat to 350°F. Working in batches, fry tortilla strips, then tortilla quarters until golden and crisp, about 1 1/2 minutes per batch. Using slotted spoon, transfer to paper towels. Drain. Mix 5 tablespoons sugar and ground cinnamon in small bowl. Sprinkle mixture onto all sides of tortillas. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Store tortillas airtight at room temperature.)
Combine milk and cinnamon sticks in heavy large saucepan. Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add bean. Bring to simmer. Remove from heat; cover and let steep 30 minutes.
Add honey to milk mixture; return to simmer. Whisk yolks and 3 tablespoons sugar in medium bowl to blend. Gradually whisk in hot milk mixture. Return mixture to saucepan and stir over medium heat until custard thickens and leaves path on back of spoon when finger is drawn across, about 3 minutes (do not boil). Strain into large bowl. Whisk in sour cream and tequila. Refrigerate until cold, stirring occasionally, about 2 hours.
Transfer custard to ice cream maker; process according to manufacturer's instructions. Fold in fried tortilla strips; process 3 minutes. Transfer to covered container; freeze until firm. (Ice cream can be made 2 days ahead. Keep frozen.)
Place 2 scoops ice cream in bowls. Garnish each with 2 fried tortilla quarters. Top with sauces and bananas, and sprinkle with pecans. Serve immediately.

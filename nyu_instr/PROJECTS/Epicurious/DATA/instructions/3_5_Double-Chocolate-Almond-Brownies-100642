Preheat oven to 375°F and line bottom and sides of an 8 x 4 x 3-inch loaf pan with foil, leaving a 1/2-inch overhang all around.
On a baking sheet toast almonds in middle of oven until golden, about 7 minutes. Into a small bowl sift together flour, baking powder, and a pinch salt. In a double boiler or a metal bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water melt unsweetened chocolate and butter, stirring until smooth. Remove top of double boiler or bowl from heat and stir in sugar and vanilla until combined well. Whisk in egg until combined well and stir in almonds, flour mixture, and chocolate chips until just combined. Pour batter into loaf pan and bake in middle of oven until a tester inserted 1 inch from side of pan comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. (Center will be fudge-like.)
Cool brownies in pan on a rack 5 minutes and lift out foil with brownies onto rack. Cut brownies into serving pieces. Brownies keep in an airtight container 3 days or frozen up to 2 weeks.

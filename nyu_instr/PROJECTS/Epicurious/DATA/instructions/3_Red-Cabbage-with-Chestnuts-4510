Preheat oven to 400°F. Using small knife, cut an X in each chestnut. Place in roasting pan. Bake until shells loosen, about 35 minutes. Cool slightly. Remove hard shell and brown skin from each nut. Set aside.
Heat oil in large pot over medium-low heat. Add onion; sauté until soft, about 5 minutes. Add cabbage, vinegar, water and sugar. Cover; cook until cabbage is tender, stirring occasionally, about 40 minutes. Add nuts; cook until warm, about 10 minutes longer. Season with salt and pepper.

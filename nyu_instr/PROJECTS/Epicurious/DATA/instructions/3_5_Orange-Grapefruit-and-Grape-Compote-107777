Finely grate zest from 2 oranges and 1 grapefruit into a small bowl and stir in sugar.
Cut peel, including all white pith, from oranges and grapefruit with a sharp knife, then, working over a large bowl, cut segments free from membranes, letting segments fall into bowl. Squeeze enough juice from membranes to measure 1/2 cup, then add to citrus segments with grapes and 3 tablespoons citrus sugar. Toss fruit gently and serve with remaining sugar on the side.

In a dry small heavy skillet toast seeds over moderate heat, shaking skillet, until fragrant, about 1 minute, and cool. With a mortar and pestle or with bottom of a heavy skillet coarsely crush seeds. Drain olives and thinly slice lemon. With flat side of a large knife lightly bruise thyme and in a bowl stir together all ingredients. Marinate olives, covered and chilled, at least 3 days and up to 1 week. Bring olives to room temperature, about 15 minutes, before serving.

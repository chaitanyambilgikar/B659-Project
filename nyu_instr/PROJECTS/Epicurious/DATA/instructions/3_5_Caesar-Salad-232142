Season salad bowl by rubbing a cut half of garlic and 1 teaspoon oil onto bottom and side of bowl (reserve garlic).
Heat 3/4 cup oil with both halves of reserved garlic over moderately high heat, turning garlic until golden, 1 to 2 minutes, then discard garlic. Add bread cubes and sauté, turning occasionally, until golden on all sides, about 2 minutes. Transfer croutons to paper towels to drain. Pour oil through a small fine-mesh sieve into a heatproof measuring cup and add enough additional olive oil to total 6 tablespoons.
Put anchovies in salad bowl and mash to a paste using 2 forks. Whisk in egg and lemon juice, then add reserved oil (warm or at room temperature) in a slow stream, whisking until emulsified. Add salt to taste.
Add romaine leaves to dressing and toss to coat. Add croutons and toss briefly.
Divide salad among 6 large plates, then sprinkle with cheese and pepper to taste. Serve immediately.

In a heavy skillet cook the onion and the mustard seeds in the butter over moderate heat until the onion begins to turn golden. Add the tomatoes, the vinegar, the sugar, and the allspice, cook the mixture, stirring and breaking up the tomatoes with a wooden spoon, until the chutney is very thick, and add the parsley and salt and pepper to taste. The chutney may be made 3 days in advance and kept covered and chilled.

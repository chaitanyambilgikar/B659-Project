Thinly slice cabbage and onion separately. In a small bowl stir together water, vinegar, and sugar until sugar is dissolved. In a 10- to 12-inch heavy skillet cook onion in oil over moderately low heat, stirring occasionally, until softened. Add cabbage and sauté over moderately high heat, stirring, until crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in vinegar mixture and pepper until combined well.

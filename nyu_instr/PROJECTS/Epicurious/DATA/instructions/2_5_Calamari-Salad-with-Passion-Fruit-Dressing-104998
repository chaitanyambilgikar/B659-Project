Plunge squid into a large saucepan of boiling water, then remove pan from heat and let stand, stirring once or twice, 1‚ minutes. Drain squid in a colander and cool. Halve squid bodies lengthwise, then cut crosswise into very thin slices. Cut tentacles into bite-size pieces.
Halve each passion fruit crosswise, then scoop out pulp and force through a fine sieve into a large bowl, discarding seeds. Whisk in remaining ingredients, then add squid and toss well.

Grilling Method: Direct/Medium Heat
Pat chicken dry (no need to rinse). Brush with oil and season with salt and pepper. Place chicken over direct heat in center of cooking grate and grill for about 15 minutes (depending on the size of the chicken breasts) turning only once about half way thru cooking time (about 7 minutes per side). Grill chicken until meat is no longer pink and the juices run clear. If using barbecue sauce, brush on chicken during the last 5 minutes of cooking time to prevent burning.

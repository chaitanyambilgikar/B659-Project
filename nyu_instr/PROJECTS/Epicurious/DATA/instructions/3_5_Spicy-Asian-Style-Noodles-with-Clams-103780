Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally; drain well. Return to same pot; toss with 1 tablespoon sesame oil. Divide pasta among shallow bowls; cover and keep warm.
Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in same pot over medium-high heat. Add bell pepper, onion, garlic, ginger and dried red pepper. Sauté until bell pepper begins to soften, about 2 minutes. Add 1 cup water, vinegar and soy sauce and bring to boil. Add clams. Cover pot and cook until clams open, about 10 minutes (discard any clams that do not open).
Spoon clams and sauce over pasta. Sprinkle with cilantro and serve.

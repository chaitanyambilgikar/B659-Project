Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter and flour twelve 3/4-cup custard cups. Stir chocolate in bowl set over simmering water until smooth. Remove from over water. Cool to lukewarm, about 10 minutes.
Using electric mixer, beat cream and cinnamon in medium bowl until soft peaks form. Add liqueur; beat until still peaks form. Beat eggs and brown sugar in large bowl until very light, about 5 minutes. Gradually beat chocolate into egg mixture, then fold in cream mixture.
Divide batter among prepared cups. Set cups in large roasting pan. Add enough hot water to pan to come halfway up sides of cups. Bake until tops of cakes look dry and tester inserted into center comes out with moist crumbs attached, about 18 minutes. Transfer cups to racks; cool cakes completely.
Cut around cakes to loosen. Turn cakes out onto plates.

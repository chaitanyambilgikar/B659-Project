Preheat oven to 350°F. Oil 13x9x2-inch glass baking dish. Heat 3 tablespoons oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions and garlic and sauté until onions are golden, about 8 minutes. Add beans, 1 1/2 cups milk, and 1 1/2 cups water; simmer until onions are tender, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. Mash beans coarsely in skillet. Mix in chile and all spices; season with salt and pepper. Add more milk or water by 1/4 cupfuls to thin bean mixture to slightly soupy consistency.
Heat remaining 1/4 cup oil in another large skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1 tortilla at a time; cook until tortilla softens, about 30 seconds per side. Transfer tortilla to work surface. Place 1 heaping tablespoon cheese in center of each tortilla; fold in half. Place in prepared dish, overlapping tortillas slightly. Top with bean sauce.
Bake until enfrijoladas are heated through and sauce is bubbling, about 20 minutes. Sprinkle with remaining queso ranchero and cilantro. Serve with sour cream.
*Mildly salty cheese that crumbles easily; also labled queso fresco or queso casero. Queso cotija or mild feta can be used instead.

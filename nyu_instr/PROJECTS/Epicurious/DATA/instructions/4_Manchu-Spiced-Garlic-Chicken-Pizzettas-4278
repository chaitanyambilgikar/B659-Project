Heat 1/4 cup oil in heavy large skillet over high heat. Add onions and sauté 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and sauté until onions are dark brown, about 25 minutes. Add sugar, vinegar and 1 1/2 teaspoons garlic; stir until liquid evaporates and onions are well glazed, about 2 minutes longer. Season with salt and pepper. Cool to room temperature.
Sprinkle chicken with salt. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in another heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and sauté 2 minutes. Add remaining 1 tablespoon garlic and sauté 2 minutes. Add chili sauce and sauté 1 minute. Remove chicken from heat. Stir in 3 tablespoons cilantro.
Preheat oven to 425°F. Sprinkle 2 large baking sheets with flour. Stretch dough from 1 tube to 12x8-inch rectangle. Cut crosswise in half, forming two 6x8-inch rectangles. Cut off corners of each rectangle, forming oval. Transfer dough to prepared baking sheet. Repeat stretching and cutting with remaining dough. Bake until tops are light brown, about 8 minutes.
Mix mozzarella, Swiss and provolone cheeses in large bowl. Sprinkle cheese mixture, tomatoes, onions, chicken and remaining 3 tablespoons cilantro over pizzas, dividing equally. Bake pizzas until cheese melts, about 5 minutes longer.

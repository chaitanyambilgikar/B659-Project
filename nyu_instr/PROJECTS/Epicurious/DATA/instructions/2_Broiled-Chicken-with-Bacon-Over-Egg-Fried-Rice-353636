Preheat broiler.
Toss chicken, scallions, and bacon with 1/2 tablespoon vegetable oil and a scant 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper in a 4-sided sheet pan. Broil 4 to 5 inches from heat, stirring once or twice, until chicken is just cooked through, about 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, beat egg with soy sauce, sesame oil, and a pinch of salt. Heat 1/2 tablespoon vegetable oil in a 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Add egg mixture and cook, stirring, until almost set, about 45 seconds. Transfer to a bowl.
Heat remaining 1/2 tablespoon vegetable oil in skillet over medium-high heat until hot, then stir-fry rice until hot, about 5 minutes. Add egg and stir-fry 1 minute. Season with salt.
Serve chicken with rice.

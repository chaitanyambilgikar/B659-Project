Peel and core pears and cut into sixths. In a small non-stick skillet melt 1 tablespoon butter over moderately high heat until foam begins to subside and sauté pears, turning occasionally, until golden, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon sugar over pears and cook, stirring once or twice, until golden brown and caramelized, about 1 minute.
In a food processor or blender purée pears until smooth and transfer to a bowl. Pear purée may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.
Preheat oven to 400°F.
In a small saucepan melt remaining 3 tablespoons butter. Cut 2 bread slices into rounds the same size as bottom of two 1/2-cup charlotte molds, ramekins, or custard cups and cut 2 bread slices into rounds the same size as tops of molds, reserving bread trimmings.
In a small food processor grind trimmings fine and stir into pear purée.
Brush smaller rounds on both sides with some melted butter and with them line bottoms of molds. Cut remaining 3 bread slices into 1-inch squares and discard crusts. Brush squares on both sides with some remaining butter and line sides of molds with them, overlapping slightly and pressing gently against side of mold.
Divide enough pear purée between lined molds to fill them to within 1/8 inch of top. Brush remaining 2 bread rounds on both sides with remaining butter and top molds with them, pressing down gently but firmly to cover filling completely.
Charlottes may be prepared up to this point 3 hours ahead and chilled, covered.
Bake charlottes 20 minutes, or until bread is golden brown.
While charlottes are baking, peel and core 2 persimmons and in food processor purée with lemon juice and additional sugar.
Divide persimmon purée between 2 dessert plates and carefully invert charlottes onto it. Cut remaining persimmmon into wedges and arrange around charlottes.

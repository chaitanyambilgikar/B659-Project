Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter and flour 12-inch-diameter pizza pan. Cut cookie-dough roll crosswise into 1/3-inch-thick slices; arrange on prepared pan. Using wet fingertips, press dough evenly into pan to form pizza crust.
Bake crust until deep golden brown, about 15 minutes. Transfer to rack. Using edge of metal spatula, press in crust edges to form even round. Cool completely.
Beat cream cheese in medium bowl until smooth. Beat in marshmallow creme. Spread filling evenly over crust, leaving 1/2-inch plain border. (Crust with filling can be made 45 minutes ahead. Let stand at room temperature.) Top with fruit as desired; drizzle with warm caramel sauce and serve.

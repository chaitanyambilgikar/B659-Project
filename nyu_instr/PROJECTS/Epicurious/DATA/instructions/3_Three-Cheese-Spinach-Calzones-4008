Preheat oven to 425°F. Mix spinach, onions, ricotta, Gorgonzola and then Fontina in medium bowl to blend. Season with salt and pepper.
Sprinkle heavy large baking sheet with flour. Unfold dough on prepared sheet. Gently stretch and/or roll dough to 11-inch square; cut in half diagonally, forming 2 triangles. Place half of filling in center of each triangle. Fold 1 side of each triangle over filling, forming 2 triangular calzones. Press edges of dough to seal. Cut 3 slits in top of each to allow steam to escape.
Bake calzones until golden brown, about 15 minutes; serve hot.

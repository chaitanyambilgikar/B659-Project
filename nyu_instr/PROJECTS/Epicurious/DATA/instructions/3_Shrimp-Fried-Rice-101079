Finely chop enough scallions to measure about 2 cups and halve shrimp lengthwise. Spread rice in a shallow baking pan and separate grains with a fork. In a small bowl lightly beat eggs.
Make seasoning liquid: In a small bowl stir together seasoning liquid ingredients.
In a deep 12-inch heavy non-stick skillet heat corn or safflower oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and stir-fry eggs until scrambled, about 30 seconds. Add scallions and gingerroot and stir-fry 1 minute. Add shrimp and peas and stir-fry until heated through. Add rice and cook, stirring frequently, 2 to 3 minutes, or until heated through. Stir seasoning liquid and add to fried rice, tossing to coat evenly.

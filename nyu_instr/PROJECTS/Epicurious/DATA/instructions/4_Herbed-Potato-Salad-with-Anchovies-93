Place potatoes in large pot. Add enough cold water to cover. Boil until just tender, about 30 minutes. Drain. Cool until just warm. Peel potatoes and cut into slices. Set aside.
Combine remaining ingredients in large bowl. Add potato slices and toss well. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Refrigerate until well chilled.

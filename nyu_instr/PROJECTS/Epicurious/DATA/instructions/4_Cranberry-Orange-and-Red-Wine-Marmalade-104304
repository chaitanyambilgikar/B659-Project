Using vegetable peeler, remove peel (orange part only) in long strips from oranges. Cut orange peel into matchstick-size strips. Cut white pith from oranges. Working over bowl to catch juices, cut between membranes to release segments. Cut segments into 1/2-inch pieces.
Bring orange juice, wine and sugar to simmer in heavy medium saucepan, stirring until sugar dissolves. Simmer 10 minutes. Add cranberries, half of orange peel and half of orange pieces and simmer until slightly thickened, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes. Add remaining orange peel and orange pieces and simmer 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Cool, cover and refrigerate (marmalade will thicken). (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Keep refrigerated.)

Grind posto almost to a paste in coffee/spice grinder and transfer to a small bowl, then stir in 1/2 cup hot water.
Heat oil in a wok over moderate heat until hot but not smoking, then stir-fry nigella seeds 30 seconds. Add 2 chiles and stir-fry 30 seconds. Add zucchini and 1/4 teaspoon salt and stir-fry 2 minutes. Stir in posto mixture, remaining 2 chiles, remaining 1/4 cup water, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and simmer, covered, until zucchini is tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove lid and briskly simmer, stirring, until any excess liquid is evaporated and posto is pale golden, about 3 minutes. Discard chiles.

In a blender or food processor purée half of large tomatoes, 1/2 cup bell pepper, 1/4 cup cucumber, 2 tablespoons onion, garlic paste, cumin, and jalapeño. Transfer purée to a bowl and stir in cherry tomatoes with remaining chopped large tomatoes, bell pepper, cucumber, and onion. Stir in vinegar and salt and pepper to taste. (Chill gazpacho, covered, at least 3 hours and up to 1 day.)
In a saucepan of generously salted boiling water boil shrimp 30 seconds, or until just cooked through. Transfer shrimp with a slotted spoon to a bowl and cool. (Shrimp may be cooked 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.) Chop shrimp and stir into gazpacho.
Before serving, thin gazpacho with ice water and top with croutons and garnish.
For basil croutons: In a blender or small food processor purée basil and oil and season with salt and pepper to taste.
Preheat oven to 350°F.
On a baking sheet toss bread with basil oil and bake in middle of oven, shaking baking sheet occasionally, 10 to 15 minutes, or until croutons are golden brown and crisp. Season croutons with salt and pepper. (Croutons may be made 3 days ahead and kept in a sealable plastic bag in a cool dry place.) Makes about 2 cups.

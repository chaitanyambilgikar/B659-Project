Mix crème fraîche, horseradish and 1 tablespoon parsley in small bowl. (Can be made 3 hours ahead. Cover and chill.)
Preheat oven to 250°F. Coarsely grate potatoes and parsnips into medium bowl. Mix in onion, 2 tablespoons chives and remaining 1 tablespoon parsley. Season with salt and pepper. Mix in egg.
Divide potato mixture into 4 equal portions. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in medium nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add 1 potato portion to skillet; flatten to 5-inch round. Cook until golden brown on bottom, about 5 minutes. Turn pancake over and cook until brown on bottom and cooked through, about 5 minutes. Transfer to ovenproof platter and place in oven to keep warm. Repeat with remaining 3 portions, adding 1 tablespoon oil to skillet for each pancake.
Place 1 pancake on each of 4 plates. Arrange 3 salmon slices atop each. Top pancakes with dollop of crème fraîche mixture. Sprinkle with remaining 1 tablespoon chives and serve immediately.

Preheat oven to 450°F. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add sliced leek and carrot strips; sauté until crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Open fish flat and arrange skin side down in large roasting pan. Sprinkle fish with salt and pepper and 1 1/2 teaspoons minced fresh thyme. Top with leek and carrot mixture and bay leaves. Dot with 2 tablespoons butter. Pour Riesling over fish.
Bake fish until just opaque in center, about 15 minutes. Transfer fish and vegetables to plates. Tent with foil to keep warm. Pour pan juices into heavy medium saucepan. Boil until reduced to 3/4 cup, about 6 minutes. Discard bay leaves. Add remaining 3 tablespoons butter and 1/2 teaspoon thyme and whisk just until butter is melted. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Pour sauce over fish and serve.

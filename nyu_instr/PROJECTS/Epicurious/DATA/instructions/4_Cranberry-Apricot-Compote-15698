Quarter apricots and pick over cranberries. In a 3-quart saucepan bring water, sugar, and apricots to a boil and simmer, stirring until sugar is dissolved, 5 minutes. Add cranberries and simmer until berries have burst, about 5 minutes. Finely chop shallots and stir into compote. Remove pan from heat and cool compote completely. Compote may be made 2 days ahead and chilled, covered.

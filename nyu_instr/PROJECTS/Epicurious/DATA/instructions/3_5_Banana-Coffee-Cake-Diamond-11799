Preheat oven to 350°F. and grease and flour a 10-inch (3-quart) bundt pan, knocking out excess flour.
Into a large bowl sift together flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt. In a small bowl stir together bananas and sour cream. In another large bowl with an electric mixer beat together butter and sugars until light and fluffy and add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in coffee extract (or espresso) and vanilla. Beat in flour mixture in batches alternately with banana mixture, beginning and ending with flour mixture, until batter is just combined.
Spoon batter into pan and bake in middle of oven 50 minutes, or until a cake tester comes out clean and cake pulls away from side of pan. Cool cake in pan 10 minutes and invert onto a rack to cool completely. Let cake stand, wrapped tightly, at room temperature overnight.
Dust cake with confectioners' sugar.

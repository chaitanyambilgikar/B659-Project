Preheat oven to 375°F. Combine flour, sugar and salt in processor; blend 10 seconds. Add butter. Using on/off turns, blend until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add egg and vanilla and almond extracts. Using on/off turns, process until moist clumps form. Gather dough into ball. Using floured fingertips, press dough onto bottom and up sides of 9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom. Press 1/2 cup almonds over bottom of crust; spread with 2/3 cup jam.
Bake tart until crust is golden at edges and jam is bubbling thickly, about 40 minutes. Cool completely on rack. Push up pan bottom to release tart.
Toss raspberries with remaining 2 tablespoons jam in bowl to coat. Top jam layer with berries. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons almonds around edge of tart.

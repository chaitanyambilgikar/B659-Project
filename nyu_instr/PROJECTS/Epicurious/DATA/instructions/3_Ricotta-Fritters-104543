If using supermarket ricotta, drain in a cheesecloth-lined sieve set over a bowl, covered and chilled, 24 hours.
Form 1 tablespoon ricotta into a ball and flatten into a 2-inch disk. Transfer to a sheet of wax paper. Make more disks with remaining ricotta in same manner.
Heat a dry large heavy nonstick skillet over moderate heat until hot. Cook ricotta disks until firm enough to turn and undersides are brown in spots, 2 to 4 minutes, then carefully turn and brown other sides, about 2 minutes.
Transfer fritters to a platter, then drizzle with oil and season with pepper.

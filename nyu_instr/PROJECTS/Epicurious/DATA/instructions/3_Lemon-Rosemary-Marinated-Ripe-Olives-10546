In a 1-quart glass jar with a tight-fitting lid combine the sliced lemon, the lemon juice, the shallots, the rosemary, and the red pepper flakes. In a saucepan of boiling water blanch the olives for 1 minute, drain them well in a colander, and add them to the jar while they are still warm. Add enough oil to the jar to just cover the olives. Seal the jar with the lid and shake it several times to combine and distribute the ingredients. Let the olives stand in a cool, dark place, shaking them daily, for 3 days. The olives keep, covered and chilled, indefinitely.

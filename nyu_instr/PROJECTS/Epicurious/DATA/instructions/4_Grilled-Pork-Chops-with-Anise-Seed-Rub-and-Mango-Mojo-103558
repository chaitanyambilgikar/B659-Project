Prepare grill (do not spread charcoal out to edges of grill).
Make mojo: 3Purée mango, lime juice, garlic, jalapeño, and salt in a blender, then stir in cilantro.
Make rub: Finely grind anise seeds and peppercorns in an electric coffee/spice grinder with salt and sugar. Transfer mixture to a small bowl and stir in oil.
Grill pork: Brush both sides of pork with spice rub.
Grill pork on an oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals 2 minutes on each side. Move pork off to side of grill (not directly over coals; moderately low heat for gas grills) and cook pork, covered, turning once, until just cooked through, about 3 minutes more on each side.
Transfer to a platter and let stand, loosely covered, 5 minutes.
Serve pork with mojo.

Make cake rounds: Preheat oven to 350°F with racks in upper and lower third. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
Whisk together flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl.
Beat butter, oil, and sugar with an electric mixer until combined well, about 2 minutes. Beat in egg, vanilla, and vinegar.
Reduce speed to low and alternately mix in flour and buttermilk in batches, beginning and ending with the flour until combined.
Add the red food coloring and mix on low speed until thoroughly combined.
Spoon 2 tablespoon mounds of batter 2-inches apart on lined baking sheets.
Bake, switching positions of baking sheets halfway through baking, until rounds are puffed and set, 8 to 10 minutes.
Slide parchment with rounds onto wire racks to cool completely.
Make filling: Beat together cream cheese, butter, lemon juice, vanilla, salt, and sugar until creamy, 1 to 2 minutes. Spread about 2 tablespoons of filling on flat-side of half the rounds; top with remaining rounds, flat side down, to form whoopie pies.

Heat oil in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add ham, savory and mustard and stir until ham begins to brown, about 2 minutes. Add 3 cups broth and lentils and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium, cover and simmer until lentils are tender, about 20 minutes. Add tomatoes with juices; simmer uncovered 2 minutes. Add more broth by 1/4 cupfuls to thin soup, if desired. Season with salt and pepper.

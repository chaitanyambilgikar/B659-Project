Preheat oven to 450°F.
Arrange fillets in a ceramic or glass baking dish just large enough to hold them in one layer. Mince garlic and in a small bowl combine with lemon juice, soy sauce, sugar, and salt. Whisk in oil until emulsified and pour vinaigrette over fish.
Bake fish in middle of oven until just cooked through and no longer translucent, 5 to 7 minutes.

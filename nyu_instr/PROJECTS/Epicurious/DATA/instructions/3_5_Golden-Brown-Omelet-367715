Heat a nonstick 8" or well-seasoned heavy steel skillet over medium-high heat for 1 minute. Add 2 tablespoons unsalted butter. Once butter sizzles and begins to brown, swirl to coat pan. Add 3 beaten eggs and season with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Cook, pulling up the edges with a heatproof silicone spatula, allowing uncooked eggs to run into pan, until the bottom is golden brown and the top begins to set, 1-2 minutes.
Add fillings, such as caramelized onions, chopped herbs, and grated Parmesan. Using the spatula, fold up 1/3 of the omelet. Roll the omelet over onto itself, then tilt the pan and slide omelet onto a plate.

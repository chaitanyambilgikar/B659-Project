For Filling: Preheat oven to 450°F. Combine all ingredients except butter in large bowl. Transfer to deep 8 1/2x11-inch baking dish or other deep 12-cup dish. Dot top with butter. Bake until hot and bubbling, about 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, prepare topping: Sift first 4 ingredients into bowl. Add butter and cut in until mixture resembles coarse meal. Make well in center. Combine 3/4 cup half and half, bourbon and vanilla and add to well. Stir until batter is just combined; do not overmix. Working quickly, drop batter by tablespoons atop hot pear mixture, covering surface completely. Sprinkle with sugar-nutmeg mixture. Immediately return to oven and bake 10 minutes. Reduce temperature to 375°F. and continue baking until topping is golden and firm to touch, about 20 minutes. Let cool at least 20 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature, pouring half and half over each serving, if desired.

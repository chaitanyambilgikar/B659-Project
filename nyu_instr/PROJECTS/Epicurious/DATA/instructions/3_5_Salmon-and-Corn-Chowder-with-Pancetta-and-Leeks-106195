Cook pancetta in heavy large pot over medium heat until crisp, about 8 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer to paper towels to drain. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons fat from pot. Add leeks, bay leaves, and thyme. Sauté until leeks are soft, about 8 minutes. Add clam juice. Increase heat to high and bring to boil. Add potatoes and corn. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 12 minutes. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Chill soup uncovered until cold, then cover and refrigerate. Cover pancetta and refrigerate. Rewarm pancetta in skillet and bring soup to simmer before continuing.) Stir salmon and cream into soup. Simmer until salmon is just cooked through, about 5 minutes. Discard bay leaves. Stir in parsley. Season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with pancetta.
* Pancetta, an Italian bacon cured in salt, is available at Italian markets, specialty foods stores and some supermarkets.

Bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil for pasta.
In a small saucepan cook garlic in oil over moderately low heat, stirring, until softened and transfer mixture to a large bowl. Add pine nuts, crushing them lightly with the back of a fork, lemon juice, zest, parsley, and salt and pepper to taste.
Cook pasta in boiling water until al dente and, reserving 2 tablespoons of the cooking water, drain well. Add pasta with the reserved cooking water to bowl and toss with lemon mixture until it is absorbed. Serve pasta warm or at room temperature.

Preheat oven to 400°F. Line large baking sheet with foil. Sprinkle lamb with salt and pepper. Blend chutney, mint jelly and chopped mint in small saucepan. Spread 1/4 cup mixture over meat side of each lamb rack. Place racks on prepared sheet, bone side down. Reserve remaining chutney mixture in pan for sauce. Roast lamb until cooked to desired doneness, about 20 minutes for medium-rare (meat thermometer will register 130°F). Cut lamb between bones into individual chops; divide among plates. Bring chutney sauce to boil, stirring constantly; spoon sauce alongside chops. Garnish with fresh mint sprigs.

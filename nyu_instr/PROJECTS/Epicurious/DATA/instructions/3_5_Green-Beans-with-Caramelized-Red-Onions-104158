Heat 3 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions; sauté until deep brown, about 35 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Cook beans in medium pot of boiling salted water until just crisp-tender, about 4 minutes. Drain; rinse under cold water until cool, then pat dry.
Whisk remaining 3 tablespoons oil in vinegar and tarragon in large bowl to blend. Add beans and onions and toss to coat. Season with salt and pepper. Serve warm or at room temperature.

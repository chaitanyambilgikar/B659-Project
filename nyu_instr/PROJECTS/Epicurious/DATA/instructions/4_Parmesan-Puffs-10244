In a small heavy saucepan combine the milk, 1/4 cup water, the butter, and the salt and bring the mixture to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to moderate, add the flour all at once, and beat the mixture with a wooden spoon until it leaves the side of the pan and forms a ball. transfer the mixture to a bowl, whisk in the eggs, 1 at a time, whisking well after each addition, and stir in the Parmesan and pepper to taste. Drop the batter in 8 mounds on a buttered baking sheet and bake the puffs in the upper third of a preheated 400°F. oven for 20 minutes, or until they are crisp and golden. The puffs may be served as an hors d'oeuvre or as an accompaniment to soups, meats, and poultry and may be stored overnight in an airtight container.

In a large kettle, simmer potatoes in salted water to cover until tender when pierced with a fork, about 10 minutes, and drain in a large colander.
In a large saucepan, cook beans in 3 inches salted boiling water over high heat until crisp-tender, about 3 to 5 minutes. With tongs or a slotted spoon, transfer beans to colander with potatoes and drain well.
In a large bowl, toss together warm potatoes, beans, herbs, oil, zest, and salt and pepper to taste. Salad may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.
Serve salad warm or at room temperature.

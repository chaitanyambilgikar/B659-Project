Sauté bacon in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat until brown and crisp, about 3 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towel and drain. Add onion to drippings in pan. Sauté until beginning to color, about 4 minutes. Add clam juice and potato and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium, cover and simmer until potato is almost tender, about 8 minutes.
Add cabbage and fish and simmer uncovered until potato is tender, fish is just opaque in center and cabbage is wilted, about 5 minutes. Add half and half and bacon; simmer 1 minute to blend flavors. Season ragout with salt and pepper. Ladle into bowls and serve.

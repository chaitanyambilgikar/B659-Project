Using electric mixer, beat butter in medium bowl until light. Gradually beat in 3/4 cup powdered sugar. Beat in extracts. Stir in flour and salt, then macadamia nuts. Refrigerate dough 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 325°F. Line 3 large baking sheets with parchment paper. Pinch off 1 tablespoon dough; shape into 2-inch-long, 1/2-inch-thick crescent. Repeat with remaining dough. Brush crescents with egg white, then dip tops into coconut. Place crescents, coconut side up, on parchment-lined sheets, spacing cookies 1 inch apart. Bake until just barely golden brown, about 20 minutes. Cool cookies on sheets on rack. Sift additional powdered sugar over cookies. (Can be prepared 1 week ahead. Transfer cookies to airtight container and freeze. Bring to room temperature before serving.)

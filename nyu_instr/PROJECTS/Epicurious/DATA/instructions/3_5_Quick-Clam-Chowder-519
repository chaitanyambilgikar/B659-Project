Sauté bacon in heavy large Dutch oven over medium heat until light brown and most of the fat is rendered. Drain off all but 2 tablespoons fat. Add onion, celery, carrots and garlic powder to Dutch oven and sauté until onions are soft, about 5 minutes. Add potatoes, clam juice, reserved juices from chopped clams and water. Bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer uncovered until potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. Add clams and half and half and simmer 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with parsley and serve.

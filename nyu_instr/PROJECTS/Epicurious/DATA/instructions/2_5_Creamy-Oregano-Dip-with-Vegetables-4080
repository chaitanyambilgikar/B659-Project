Set strainer over 4-cup measuring cup. Line strainer with paper towel. Add yogurt to strainer; chill until yogurt is thick (about 1 cup liquid will drain from yogurt), at least 2 hours or overnight.
Turn yogurt out into medium bowl; discard paper towel and drained liquid. Add chopped fresh and dried oregano, lemon peel, lemon juice, salt, pepper and cayenne to yogurt and stir to blend. Cover and refrigerate to develop flavors, at least 2 hours and up to 6 hours.
Place bowl with dip on platter. Surround with endive spears and cherry tomatoes and serve.

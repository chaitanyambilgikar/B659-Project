In a food processor purée the preserved kumquats and the syrup with the lemon juice and the mustard. In a shallow baking pan pour the kumquat glaze over the bacon, bake the bacon in the middle of a preheated 350°F. oven, basting it several times with the glaze, for 30 minutes, and let it stand, covered loosely with foil, for 10 minutes before slicing. Transfer the bacon to a platter and garnish it with fresh kumquats and the parsley.

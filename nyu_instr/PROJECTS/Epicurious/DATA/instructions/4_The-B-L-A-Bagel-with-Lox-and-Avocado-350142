A short time before serving, mash avocado and add lemon juice. Season with pepper and only a bit of salt, as there will be enough in the lox. Split bagels and spread each half with avocado. Top with lox. Put onion, tomato, and capers (if using) on bottom half, then set top half of sandwich in place. Serve at once.

Preheat oven to 375°F. Oil 8x8x2-inch glass baking dish. Mix first 5 ingredients in large bowl. Stir in 1 1/4 cups Coca-Cola. Add beans; stir to blend. Transfer to prepared dish. Top bean mixture with bacon pieces. Bake until bacon is crisp and bean mixture is hot and bubbling, about 1 hour. If mixture is dry, pour 1/4 cup more Coca-Cola over bean mixture to moisten. Let stand 10 minutes. Serve.

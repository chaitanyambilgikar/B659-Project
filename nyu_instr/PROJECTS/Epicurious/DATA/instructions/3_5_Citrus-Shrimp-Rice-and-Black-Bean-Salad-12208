In a small saucepan bring water and salt to a boil and simmer zests 1 minute. With a slotted spoon transfer zests to a cutting board. Add shrimp to cooking water and simmer, covered, 2 minutes, or until just cooked through. With slotted spoon transfer shrimp to a colander to drain. Stir rice into cooking water and cook, covered, over moderately low heat until liquid is absorbed, about 20 minutes.
While rice is cooking, cut zests into julienne strips and in a large bowl stir together with orange and lime juices, vinegar, cumin, and red pepper flakes. Halve shrimp lengthwise and add to zest mixture, tossing to coat. Chill mixture, covered, 15 minutes. Add rice, beans, bell pepper, and coriander, tossing to combine, and cool slightly.
Just before serving, add romaine and salt and pepper to taste and toss salad.

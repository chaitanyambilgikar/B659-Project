1. Combine the cumin, saffron and salt. Set aside.
2. Heat the butter and oil in a pot over low heat. Add the onion and wilt, stirring, for 5 minutes. Add garlic and carrots; cook 5 minutes more, sprinkling with the spice mixture.
3. Add the rice and cook for 1 minute, stirring to mix well. Add the broth and cherries. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce the heat to a simmer and cook, covered, until all the liquid is absorbed, about 20 minutes. Fluff the rice with a fork. Serve hot.

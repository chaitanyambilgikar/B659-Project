In a small bowl stir together chili powder, brown sugar, cayenne, and salt. On a work surface sprinkled with 2 tablespoons parsley roll out 1 sheet puff pastry into a 12-inch square. Sprinkle square evenly with half of spice mixture and 3/4 cup Cheddar, pressing cheese gently onto pastry. Roll up 1 edge to middle of pastry sheet and roll up parallel edge in same manner so that the 2 rolls are touching. Repeat procedure with remaining parsley, pastry sheet, spice mixture, and Cheddar. Wrap pastry rolls in plastic wrap and chill 30 minutes. Pastry rolls may be made 2 weeks ahead and frozen, wrapped well in refrigerator 2 hours before proceeding.
Preheat oven to 375°F.
Cut pastry rolls with a sharp knife crosswise into slices just under 1/2 inch thick and arrange 1 inch apart on large baking sheets. Bake palmiers in batches in middle of oven 20 minutes, or until golden brown, and transfer with a metal spatula to racks to cool.

Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter six 1 1/4-cup soufflé dishes or custard cups. Combine butter and 3/4 cup water in heavy large saucepan over high heat. Bring to boil, stirring until butter melts. Remove from heat. Add chocolate, sugar, coffee and salt; stir until chocolate melts and mixture is smooth. Stir in rum and vanilla. Beat eggs in large bowl to blend; gradually whisk in chocolate mixture.
Divide chocolate mixture among prepared dishes. Bake until edges of cakes crack slightly but center 2 inches remain soft and glossy, about 25 minutes. Serve cakes warm, topped with vanilla ice cream, if desired.

Preheat oven to 375°F. Butter 8-inch square baking dish. Steam zucchini until tender, about 10 minutes. Transfer to large bowl and mash coarsely with fork. Spoon zucchini into sieve and drain well, pressing to release excess water. Place drained zucchini in bowl.
Melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and garlic; sauté until light brown, about 10 minutes. Add onion mixture to zucchini in bowl. Add eggs, 1/2 cup Parmesan, breadcrumbs and basil; stir to blend well. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer mixture to prepared dish. Bake until firm in center and brown on top, about 45 minutes. Cut into squares and serve, passing additional Parmesan separately.

Remove rind and any seeds from watermelon. Cut fruit into 1 1/2-inch pieces and put in a large bowl. Cut tomatoes into 1 1/2-inch pieces. Add tomatoes and salt to watermelon, tossing to combine. Let mixture stand at cool room temperature 3 hours.
In a colander set over a small saucepan drain mixture and transfer to a bowl. Simmer liquid until reduced to about 2 tablespoons and cool completely. Halve onion and thinly slice enough to measure 1/4 cup. Add onion to watermelon mixture. (For best results do not chill salad, as it will lose flavor.) In a small bowl stir together reduced watermelon-tomato juice, lime juice, gingerroot, and sugar.
Just before serving, toss salad with juice mixture.

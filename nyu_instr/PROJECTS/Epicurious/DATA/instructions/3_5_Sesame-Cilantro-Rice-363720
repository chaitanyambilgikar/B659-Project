Combine rice, ginger, and 2 1/2 cups water in heavy large saucepan; sprinkle generously with salt. Bring to boil over high heat, stirring once. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer until rice is tender and water is absorbed, 15 to 18 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat peanut oil and sesame oil in heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add green onions and sauté until just tender, 2 to 3 minutes.
Remove ginger from rice. Season rice to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Spoon rice into bowl. Sprinkle rice with cilantro and sesame seeds, then green onions.

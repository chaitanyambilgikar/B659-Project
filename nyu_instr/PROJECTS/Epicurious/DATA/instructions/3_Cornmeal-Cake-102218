1. Preheat the oven to 450°F (230°C). Pour the melted butter into a 10-inch (25 cm) tart pan and swirl it around so it evenly covers the bottom.
2. Heat the milk in a small saucepan over low heat until it is hot but not boiling. Keep it hot over very low heat.
3. In a large bowl, whisk the egg with the sugar. Then whisk in the cornmeal, flour, and salt. Whisking vigorously, slowly add the hot milk, stirring until combined.
4. Strew the apple slices over the surface of the tart pan. Whisk the cornmeal mixture again and pour it over the apples, shaking the tart pan if necessary, so that the batter evenly covers the surface. The apples slices will stick well above the batter. Bake in the center of the oven until the cake is deep golden on the edges and a lighter golden in the center, 15 to 20 minutes.
5. When the corn cake is cooked, remove it from the oven and serve immediately, with salad alongside.

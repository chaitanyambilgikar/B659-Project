Make sorbet: Bring sugar, water, and star anise to a boil over moderately high heat, stirring until sugar is dissolved, then reduce heat and simmer syrup 5 minutes. Cool, then discard star anise.
Peel 1 pineapple half, reserving rind, then core and cut into 1-inch chunks.
Squeeze juice from rind with your hands into a blender and add chunks. Purée at high speed until very smooth, about 1 minute. Stir purée into syrup and chill, covered, until very cold, about 4 hours.
Freeze in ice cream maker, then transfer to an airtight container and put in freezer to harden, at least 1 hour.
Roast pineapple: Preheat oven to 500°F.
Peel remaining pineapple half but do not core. Trim ends and cut remainder crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Brush some butter on a baking sheet, then arrange pineapple in 1 layer over it and brush with rest of butter.
Roast pineapple slices in middle of oven until undersides are browned (tops will only color slightly), 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from oven and turn slices over. Cool on baking sheet on a rack to room temperature.
Assemble dessert: Arrange 3 slices of roasted pineapple on each of 4 plates and top with sorbet.

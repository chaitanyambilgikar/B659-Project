Whisk together milk, cornstarch, coffee granules, and 1 tablespoon granulated sugar in a small saucepan until smooth. Cook, whisking, over moderate heat until pudding boils and is thickened, 1 to 2 minutes, and transfer to a bowl. Stir in vanilla and put a sheet of wax paper on surface of pudding to prevent a skin from forming. Cool pudding to warm.
Preheat oven to 400°F. Lightly oil 2 (6-oz.) ramekins and sprinkle each with 1/2 tablespoon granulated sugar.
Beat egg whites with cream of tartar and a pinch salt in a large bowl until they just hold soft peaks. Gradually add remaining 3 tablespoons granulated sugar, beating until whites hold stiff peaks. Stir 1/4 of whites into pudding to lighten and fold in remaining whites gently but thoroughly.
Mound mixture into ramekins and bake on a baking sheet in lower third of oven until puffed and golden brown, about 15 minutes. Lightly dust soufflés with confectioners sugar and serve immediately with mocha sauce.

Using vegetable peeler, remove peel (yellow part only) from lemons in large strips. Pour milk into heavy 1-quart saucepan. Bring to simmer. Remove from heat. Add lemon peel. Cover and let stand 1 hour. Strain milk; discard peel. Return to pan.
Mix 1/3 cup sugar, flour and cornstarch in cup. Using electric mixer, beat yolks in large bowl until light. Add sugar mixture; beat until light, about 1 minute.
Bring milk to simmer again. Gradually whisk hot milk into milk mixture. Return mixture to saucepan. Stir over low hear until custard thickens and bubbles. Remove from heat. Whisk in lemon juice, butter and vanilla extract, then marscapone cheese. Cool slightly.
Using small sharp knife and working over medium bowl, cut oranges between membranes to release segments. (Custard and orange segments can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover separately and refrigerate. Rewarm custard over medium-low heat before continuing.)
Preheat broiler. Divide warm custard among six 1-cup broilerproof gratin dishes or custard cups. Arrange orange segments atop custard. Gently press on segments to submerge slightly. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon powdered sugar over each. Place on baking sheet. Broil until sugar browns, rotating gratins for even broiling if necessary and watching closely, about 3 minutes. Transfer dishes to plates and serve warm.

Arrange chickpeas in 1 layer on paper towels and allow to air-dry while frying other ingredients.
Heat oil in a 3-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat until deep-fat thermometer registers 365°F.
While oil is heating, peel sweet potato and, using peeler (preferably Y-shaped), shave enough thin strips to measure 2 cups (reserve remaining sweet potato for another use).
Fry sweet-potato shavings, 1/2 cup at a time, until golden and just crisp, about 1 minute, then transfer with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain. (Return oil to 365°F between batches.)
Cool oil to 340°F.
Fry pumpkin seeds in 2 batches, covered (seeds will pop and splatter), until puffed (but not brown), 30 seconds to 1 minute, then transfer with slotted spoon to paper towels to drain. (Return oil to 340°F between batches.)
Fry chiles until crisp but still red, about 1 minute, then transfer with slotted spoon to paper towels to drain.
Fry chickpeas in 2 batches until golden and crisp throughout, 5 to 10 minutes, then transfer with slotted spoon to paper towels to drain.
Toss sweet-potato crisps, pumpkin seeds, chiles, chickpeas, and raisins with sugar, cayenne, and salt to taste.

Spray grill with oil spray and prepare barbecue (medium-low heat). Spray all vegetables on all sides with oil spray. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill vegetables until tender, turning often, about 10 minutes for zucchini, 12 minutes for peppers and 30 minutes for yams.
Meanwhile, mix orange peel and rosemary in small bowl. Whisk lemon juice and next 3 ingredients in large bowl. Season dressing with salt and pepper. Add grilled vegetables to dressing; toss to coat.
Divide vegetables among 4 plates. Sprinkle peel mixture over. Place 1 egg half alongside vegetables on each plate.

Heat the cream in a heavy medium saucepan over medium heat until small bubbles appear around the edge. Do not let the cream boil. Remove from the heat and add the sugar, stirring until the sugar dissolves completely. Cool to room temperature.
Cut the peaches into eighths and place in the blender with the peach nectar. Blend until the peaches are puréed. Stir the peach purée and vanilla into the cooled cream. Refrigerate until cold or overnight.
Freeze in 1 or 2 batches in your ice cream machine according to the manufacturer's instructions. When finished, the ice cream will be soft but ready to eat. For firmer ice cream, transfer to a freezer-safe container and freeze at least 2 hours.

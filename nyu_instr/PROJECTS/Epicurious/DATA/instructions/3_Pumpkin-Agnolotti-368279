Mash pumpkin purée, Parmesan, sugar, and lemon zest in a medium bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Arrange wonton wrappers on a work surface. Brush edges with lightly beaten egg. Place 1 teaspoon filling on bottom half; fold top half over, gently pressing edges to seal. Boil ravioli in salted water until just tender, about 3 minutes.
Melt butter with crème fraîche in a sauté pan. Add ravioli and 2 tablespoons pasta cooking liquid; toss to coat. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Top with grated Parmesan and pumpkin seeds (pepitas).

For Syrup: Bring all ingredients to boil in heavy medium saucepan. Boil until liquid is reduced to 3/4 cup, about 25 minutes. Using small sharp knife, scrape vanilla seeds into syrup; return bean to syrup. Cool. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and store at room temperature.)
For Fruit: Cut peel and white pith off oranges and grapefruit. Using small sharp knife, cut between membranes of oranges and grapefruit to release segments. Cut each kiwi into 8 wedges. Cut pineapple into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Drain fruit. Place in bowl. Discard vanilla bean and star anise from syrup. Pour syrup over fruit and stir to combine. Serve over frozen vanilla yogurt or ice cream.

Put the bones in a pot and rinse very well under cold running water, letting the water run over them continuously and changing it 3 or 4 times until the water appears clear in the pot, with no blood or cloudy discoloration. Drain the bones and pat dry with paper towels.
Put the bones, onions, carrots, garlic, and water in a large heavy-bottomed stockpot over medium heat. Bring to a boil and skim the surface with a spoon to remove any scum that rises to the top. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for 45 minutes.
Strain the stock through a fine-mesh strainer set over a large bowl. If not using right away, cool the stock. To do this, fill a very large bowl with ice, then set the bowl of stock in it, encouraging the hot liquid to cool quickly. The stock can be refridgerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days or frozen for up to 2 months.

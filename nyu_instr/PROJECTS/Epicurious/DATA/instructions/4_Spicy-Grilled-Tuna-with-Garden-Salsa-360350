Roast garlic and jalapeños in a small, dry skillet over medium heat, turning occasionally, until soft (both will blacken in spots), 5 to 10 minutes for jalapeños, 15 minutes for garlic. Cool, then peel garlic. Puree garlic, jalapeños, lime juice and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a blender until smooth. Scoop 1/2 cup puree into a 13" x 9" glass baking dish. Place fish on puree, flipping once to coat both sides. Cover dish; refrigerate 10 to 20 minutes to marinate. Transfer remaining puree into another bowl for salsa. Mix in tomatoes. Rinse onion in a small strainer under cold water; drain. Add to tomato mixture. Stir in cilantro, mint and basil. Season with remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. Coat grill with cooking spray; heat to medium-high (about 375°F). Remove fish from marinade; place on grill. Cover grill and cook 3 minutes. Uncover, flip fish, cover again and cook until fish is done, about 2 minutes more for medium-rare. Transfer fish to plates; spoon salsa on top.

In a 2-quart saucepan whisk together milk, egg, zest, tapioca, and 3 tablespoons sugar until egg is incorporated and let stand 5 minutes. Bring tapioca mixture to a full boil over moderate heat, stirring constantly. Remove pan from heat and stir in vanilla. Cool tapioca mixture, uncovered, 20 minutes. In a food processor pulse cranberries until finely chopped and transfer to a small saucepan. Add remaining 1/4 cup sugar and cook over moderate heat, stirring, until sugar is completely dissolved. Transfer cranberry mixture to a bowl set in a larger bowl of ice and cold water and cool, stirring occasionally, until cold.
Transfer tapioca mixture to another bowl set in a larger bowl of ice and cold water and cool, stirring occasionally, until cold.
Reserve 1 tablespoon cranberry mixture for garnish. Beginning with cranberry mixture and ending with tapioca mixture, alternately layer mixtures in each of 2 parfait glasses. (Parfaits may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.)
Garnish parfaits with reserved cranberry mixture.

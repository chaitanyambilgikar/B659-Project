For crust: Blend flour, sugar, and almonds in processor until nuts are finely ground. Using on/off turns, cut in butter until coarse meal forms. Add egg; blend just until dough forms. Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk, wrap in plastic, and chill 1 hour.
Roll out dough on lightly floured surface to 12-inch round. Transfer dough to 10-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom and trim edges. Refrigerate crust 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 375°F. Bake crust until golden brown, about 17 minutes.
For filling: Stir sugar and corn syrup in heavy small saucepan over medium-high heat until sugar dissolves. Boil mixture without stirring until syrup turns golden brown, swirling pan occasionally and brushing down sides often with wet pastry brush, about 4 minutes. Stir in 1 cup whipping cream (mixture will bubble vigorously). Stir until any caramel bits dissolve. Remove mixture from heat. Place milk chocolate and honey in medium bowl. Pour caramel over and whisk until chocolate is melted and mixture is smooth. Stir in chopped pecans. Transfer filling to crust. Chill until set, about 4 hours.
Place bittersweet chocolate in small bowl. Bring remaining 1/3 cup cream to boil in small saucepan over medium-high heat. Pour over bittersweet chocolate; stir until melted and smooth. Pour chocolate mixture evenly over tart. Refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour. (Can be made 1 day ahead; keep refrigerated.) Cut tart into wedges and serve.

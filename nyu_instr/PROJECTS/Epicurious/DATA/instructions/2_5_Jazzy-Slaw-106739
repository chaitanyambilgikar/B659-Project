Toss the cabbage, carrots, bell pepper and onion in a large bowl. In another bowl, combine the remaining ingredients except the parsley. Fold into the vegetables. Cover and refrigerate for at least 3 hours for the flavors to blend. Serve at room temperature in a decorative bowl, sprinkled with the chopped parsley.

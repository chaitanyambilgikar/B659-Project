Make aspic: Bring apple juice to a boil in a small saucepan. Remove from heat and stir in gelatin until dissolved. Pour into an 8-inch square baking dish and chill, uncovered, until firm, about 2 hours.
Make gazpacho sorbet: Soften gelatin in hot water 1 minute.
Mash garlic to a paste with salt using a mortar and pestle (or mince and mash with a large knife). Blend garlic paste, tomatoes, bell pepper, onion, cucumber, vinegar, orujo, and sugar in a food processor until as smooth as possible. Add oil and gelatin mixture with motor running, then force purée through a sieve into a bowl, pressing firmly on solids. Discard solids.
Chill until cold, about 1 hour, then freeze in ice cream maker. Transfer sorbet to an airtight container and put in freezer to harden.
Reduce balsamic vinegar: Boil vinegar in a small nonreactive saucepan until syrupy, 1 to 2 minutes, then cool completely.
Assemble dish: Cut aspic into small cubes and divide among 4 plates. Drizzle aspic with balsamic vinegar, then top with a scoop (about 1/4 cup) of sorbet.

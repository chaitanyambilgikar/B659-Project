Preheat oven to 375°F. Roll out dough on floured surface to 12-inch round. Transfer to 9-inch-diameter glass pie dish. Fold edge under; crimp. Pierce crust all over with fork. Freeze 10 minutes. Line with foil; fill with dried beans or pie weights.
Bake crust until sides are set, about 15 minutes. Remove foil and beans. Bake until bottom begins to color, piercing with toothpick if crust bubbles, about 10 minutes longer. Cool on rack 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, stir dates and brandy in small bowl to blend. Mix brown sugar, butter, nutmeg and salt in medium bowl until paste forms. Whisk in corn syrup, then 3 eggs. Add nuts and date mixture. Beat 1 egg to blend in small bowl for glaze.
Brush inside of crust with some of glaze. Pour filling into crust. Bake 15 minutes. Cover edges of crust with foil. Continue to bake pie until filling is puffed and set in center, about 20 minutes. Transfer pie to rack; cool. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Let stand at room temperature.)
Serve pie with whipped cream.

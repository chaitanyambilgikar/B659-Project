Gently rinse and dry zucchini blossoms. Heat 3 tablespoons oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add blossoms and sauté until beginning to brown in spots, turning often, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon fleur de sel and 1/8 teaspoon white pepper. Transfer blossoms to paper towels and gently blot off excess oil.
Place 4 bread slices on work surface. Sprinkle 1/2 cup Fontina on each slice. Top each with 5 blossoms. Top with remaining 4 bread slices; press down to compact. Lightly brush both sides of bread with oil.
If using panini grill, cook each sandwich until golden brown, about 7 minutes. If using nonstick skillet, heat skillet over medium heat; add sandwiches to skillet, then top with second heavy skillet to weigh down. Grill sandwiches until golden brown and cheese melts, about 4 minutes per side.

Preheat oven to 400°F.
In a medium heavy skillet cook prosciutto and onion in oil over moderate heat, stirring, until onion is softened. Remove skillet from heat and stir in arugula and salt and pepper to taste.
Arrange flour tortillas on 2 baking sheets and top with arugula mixture and Parmesan.
Bake pizzas on upper and lower racks of oven, switching positions of baking sheets halfway through baking, until edges are golden, about 10 minutes.

Prepare grill.
Make relish: In a bowl combine all ingredients with salt to taste.
Season steaks with salt and generously with pepper. Grill steaks on an oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals 4 to 5 minutes on each side for medium-rare meat. (Alternatively, steaks may be grilled in a hot well-seasoned ridged grill pan over moderately high heat in the same manner.)
Serve steaks with relish.

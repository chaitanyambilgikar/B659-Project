Cook peas on stovetop with water (1/4 cup) according to package directions (do not drain). Pulse in a food processor with cooking water, butter, scallions, lime juice (to taste), and 1/4 teaspoon salt to a coarse purée. Season with salt.
Stir together curry powder and 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper on a plate. Pat scallops dry and coat all over with curry mixture.
Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until hot, then sauté scallops in 2 batches, turning once, until browned and just cooked through, about 4 minutes per batch. Transfer with tongs to a clean plate. Serve scallops over pea purée.

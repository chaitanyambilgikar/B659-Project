Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350°F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
Pulse almonds with cocoa and 1/2 cup confectioners sugar in a food processor until very fine and powdery.
Beat egg whites with a pinch of salt in a large bowl with an electric mixer at medium-high speed until they hold soft peaks, then add remaining 2 tablespoons confectioners sugar, a little at a time, beating until whites just hold stiff peaks.
Fold one third of almond mixture into whites with a rubber spatula, then fold in remaining almond mixture gently but thoroughly.
Transfer batter to pastry bag and pipe 24 (1 1/2-inch-wide) rounds (1/3 inch thick) about 1 inch apart onto baking sheet. Tap down any peaks with a finger dipped in cold water. Bake until macaroons are puffed and edges are slightly darker, 15 to 18 minutes. Cool on baking sheet on a rack 20 minutes.
While macaroons bake, heat chocolate and half-and-half in a 1-quart heavy saucepan over low heat, stirring constantly, until mixture is smooth and chocolate is completely melted. Cool to room temperature.
When macaroons are cool, spoon chocolate filling into a small resealable plastic bag and seal bag, forcing out excess air. Make a tiny snip off 1 bottom corner of bag with scissors to form a 1/8-inch hole.
Pipe a small mound (1 teaspoon) of chocolate filling onto flat sides of 12 macaroons, then top with remaining 12 macaroons to form sandwich cookies, pressing flat sides together gently. (You may have some filling left over.)

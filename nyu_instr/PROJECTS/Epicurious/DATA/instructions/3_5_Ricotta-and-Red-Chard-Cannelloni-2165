Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; sauté until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add chard; toss until wiled and almost tender, about 3 minutes. Transfer mixture to large bowl; cool 10 minutes. Mix in ricotta and 1 cup Parmesan. Season with salt and pepper.
Spread 3/4 cup sauce over bottom of 13x9x2-inch glass baking dish. Place 1 lasagna noodle on work surface. Spread 1/3 cup filling over noodle. Starting at 1 short side, roll up noodle jelly roll style. Place filled noodle, seam side down, in prepared dish. Repeat filling and rolling remaining lasagna noodles. Arrange in dish. Pour remaining sauce over cannelloni. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover with plastic wrap; refrigerate. Uncover; let stand at room temperature 30 minutes before continuing.)
Preheat oven to 350°F. Cover dish loosely with foil. Bake cannelloni until heated through, about 45 minutes. Let stand uncovered 10 minutes. Serve, passing remaining 1 1/2 cups Parmesan.

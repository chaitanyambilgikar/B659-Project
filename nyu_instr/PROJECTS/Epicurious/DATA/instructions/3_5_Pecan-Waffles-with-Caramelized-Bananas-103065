Preheat oven to 250°F and preheat waffle iron. Whisk together flour, pecans, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Stir in buttermilk, 6 tablespoons butter, and egg until smooth (batter will be thick). Spoon batter into waffle iron, using half of batter for 4 (4-inch) standard waffles and spreading batter evenly, and cook according to manufacturer's instructions. Transfer waffles to a baking sheet and keep warm, uncovered, in middle of oven. Make more waffles in same manner.
Halve bananas crosswise and then lengthwise. Roll bananas in sugar to coat. Heat remaining 2 tablespoons butter in a large nonstick skillet over moderately high heat until foam subsides, then sautâ€© bananas, starting with cut sides down and turning once, until golden brown. Transfer bananas with a spatula to an oiled baking sheet and cool slightly.
Put 4 waffles on 4 plates and divide bananas among them. Top bananas with remaining waffles.

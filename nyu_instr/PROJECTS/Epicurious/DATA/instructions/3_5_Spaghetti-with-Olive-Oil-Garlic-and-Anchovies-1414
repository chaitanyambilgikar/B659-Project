Heat oil in heavy small skillet over low heat. Add garlic and cook 2 minutes. Add anchovies and cook until garlic just begins to color, 3 minutes.
Meanwhile, cook spaghetti in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally. Drain well. Return spaghetti to pot. Add oil mixture and lemon juice and toss to coat. Season with pepper. Divide between plates. Sprinkle generously with parsley. Serve, passing Parmesan separately if desired.

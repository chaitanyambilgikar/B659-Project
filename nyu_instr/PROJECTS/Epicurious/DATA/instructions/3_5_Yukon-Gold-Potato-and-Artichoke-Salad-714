FOR SALAD: Cook potatoes in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender, about 22 minutes. Drain well. Cool. Cut into 1-inch pieces.
Halfway fill large bowl with cold water. Squeeze in juice from half of lemon. Cut second lemon half in half. Cut off stem from 1 artichoke and rub exposed area with cut side of lemon piece. Starting from base of artichoke, bend each leaf back and snap off where leaf breaks naturally. Continue until light green leaves are exposed. Cut off top 2 inches of artichoke above heart. Using small sharp knife, cut off all dark green areas. Cut artichoke heart into quarters. Rub all cut surfaces with lemon piece. Cut out choke and pink inner leaves from each section and discard. Place artichoke heart sections in water with lemon juice. Repeat with remaining artichokes.

Cool. Cut into slices. (Potatoes and artichokes can be made 1 day ahead. Cover separately and refrigerate.)

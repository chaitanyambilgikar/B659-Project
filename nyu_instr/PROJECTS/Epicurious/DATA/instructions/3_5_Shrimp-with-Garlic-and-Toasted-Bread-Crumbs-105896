1. Preheat the oven to 450°F. Lightly oil a large baking pan.
2. In a bowl, combine the bread crumbs, parsley, garlic, and salt and pepper to taste. Add 3 tablespoons oil, or enough to moisten the crumbs.
3. Arrange the shrimp in the pan in a single layer, curling each one into a circle. Spoon a little of the crumb mixture onto each shrimp. Drizzle with a little more oil.
4. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes, depending on the size of the shrimp, or until the shrimp turn pink and the crumbs are lightly browned. Serve with lemon wedges.

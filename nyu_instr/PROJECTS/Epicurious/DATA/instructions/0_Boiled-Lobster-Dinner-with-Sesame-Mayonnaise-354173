Cook green beans and corn in an 8-to 10-quart pot of salted boiling water until crisp-tender, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a platter and return water to a boil.
Plunge 2 lobsters headfirst into boiling water and cook, partially covered, over medium-high heat 8 minutes (for 1 1/4-pound lobsters) to 9 minutes (for 1 1/2-pound lobsters) from time they enter water. Transfer with tongs to a colander to drain. Return water to a boil and cook remaining lobsters.
While lobsters cook, whisk together mayonnaise, soy sauce, and sesame oil.
Serve lobsters with green beans, corn, and sesame mayonnaise.

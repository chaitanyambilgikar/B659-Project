Make the pasta dough: Combine the ingredients in a food processor. Process until the dough mixture leaves the sides of the bowl. Remove to a mixing bowl and knead by hand for a few minutes until smooth. (If the dough is too dry, add a few drops of water.) Divide into 4 equal parts and shape them into discs. Wrap in plastic wrap and let rest for 1 hour.
Make the ravioli filling Put the cheeses, salt, and pepper in a blender and pulse. Add the egg yolks and pulse until incorporated.
Make the ravioli Roll the discs of dough into thin sheets in a pasta machine. Arrange tablespoon-size dollops of the filling 1 1/2 inches apart on one of the sheets. Brush a little egg white around each dollop, then place another sheet directly on top. Gently press around the filling to remove any air pockets and seal the sheets. Using a ravioli cutter or a knife, cut out ravioli squares. Sprinkle with flour to prevent the dough from sticking.
Cooking the ravioli Cook the ravioli in plenty of boiling salted water until they float to the top, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain well and toss with the Fresh tomato sauce . Garnish with the remaining chopped basil and serve immediately.

Wash spinach well, discarding any tough stems. Bring 1 inch of salted water to a boil in a large pot. Add spinach, toss, and cook until just wilted. Drain off any liquid. Toss with lemon oil. Add salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Remove skin and pith of remaining lemon and slice thinly. Garnish spinach with lemon slices.

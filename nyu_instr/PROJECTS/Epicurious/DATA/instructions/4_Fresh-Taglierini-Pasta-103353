Make dough: Pulse together all ingredients except additional flour in a food processor until mixture just begins to form a ball. Knead dough on a work surface, incorporating additional flour as necessary, until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Divide dough into 4 pieces and keep each wrapped in plastic wrap until ready to roll out.
Roll out dough: Set smooth rollers of a pasta machine at widest setting. Flatten 1 piece of dough into a rectangle and feed through rollers. Fold in half and feed through rollers 8 or 9 more times to continue kneading, folding in half each time and dusting with flour as necessary to prevent sticking.
Cut pasta: Turn dial to next narrower setting and feed dough through rollers without folding. Continue to feed dough through, without folding, making space between rollers narrower each time until narrowest setting is reached. Halve sheet crosswise and arrange on a dry kitchen towel, letting pasta hang over edge of work surface. Roll out remaining dough in same manner.
Attach ribbon-pasta cutters to pasta machine and attach handle to 1/8-inch-wide cutter. Line a tray with a dry kitchen towel. Feed first rolled-out pasta sheet, which will have dried slightly but should still be flexible, through cutter and toss with some flour. Form pasta loosely into a nest and arrange on kitchen-towel–lined tray. Make more taglierini with remaining dough. Cover taglierini with plastic wrap until ready to use.

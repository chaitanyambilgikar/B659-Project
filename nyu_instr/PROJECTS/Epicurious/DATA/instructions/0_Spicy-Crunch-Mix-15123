Cut shallots crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices. In a deep 12-inch heavy skillet heat oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and fry shallots, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, about 7 minutes. Transfer shallots with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain and season with salt. Pour off all but about 1 1/2 tablespoons oil from skillet and stir in cayenne and cumin. Cook spices over moderate heat, stirring, until fragrant, about 10 seconds. Remove skillet from heat and cool seasoned oil to room temperature.
Add shallots, peas, soybeans, and salt and pepper to taste to seasoned oil, tossing to combine. Mix may be made 1 day ahead and kept in an airtight container at room temperature.

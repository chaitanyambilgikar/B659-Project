Pat steaks dry and cut 3 shallow slits across center cartilage in each steak (to prevent curling), then sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper (total).
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers, then sauté steaks, turning once, 5 to 9 minutes total for medium-rare. Transfer to a plate and keep warm, covered.
Add shallot and remaining tablespoon oil to skillet and sauté over medium-high heat 30 seconds. Add mushrooms and sauté until golden, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in Madeira, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper and briskly simmer 2 minutes. Stir in water and any meat juices from plate and boil 2 minutes. Stir cornstarch mixture, then stir into mushrooms and simmer until thickened, about 1 minute. Season sauce with salt and spoon over steaks.

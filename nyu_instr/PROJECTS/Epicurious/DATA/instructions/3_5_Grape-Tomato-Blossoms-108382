Stir together cheese and basil until combined well. Put 1/2 teaspoon cheese in center of 1 salami round. Press 1 tomato, stemmed end down, into cheese (to stabilize it), then gather salami up around tomato. Turn wrapped tomato on its side and tie salami with a chive just below gathers (handle chive gently so it won't break), leaving top of tomato exposed. Make more "blossoms" in same manner, then trim chives.

In a large saucepan of boiling water cook shrimp with salt and crab-boil spices until just cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain shrimp and transfer to a large bowl.
In a small bowl, whisk together vinegar, oil, pickling spices and salt and pepper to taste and add to shrimp. Add remaining ingredients and combine mixture well. Chill shrimp, covered, overnight.
Serve pickled shrimp slightly chilled.

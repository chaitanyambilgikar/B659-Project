Put oven rack in upper third of oven and preheat oven to 400°F.
Pat hens dry and whisk together remaining ingredients in a small bowl.
Marinate hens in orange juice mixture in a sealed bag, chilled, 15 minutes.
Transfer hens, skin sides up, with marinade to a 13- by 9- by 3-inch roasting pan and roast, basting with juices every 10 minutes, for 30 minutes. After third basting, roast hens until skin is golden and juices run clear when a thigh is pierced, about 15 minutes more. Transfer hens to a platter and drizzle liberally with pan juices.

Stir together saffron and water in a small bowl until saffron begins to dissolve (threads will still be intact). Transfer saffron mixture to a food processor along with remaining ingredients except oil, then pulse until combined. With motor running, add oil in a thin, steady stream until aïoli is thickened and emulsified. Transfer to a bowl and chill, covered, until ready to use.

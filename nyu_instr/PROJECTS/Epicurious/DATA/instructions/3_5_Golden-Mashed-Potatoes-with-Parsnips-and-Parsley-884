Combine potatoes, parsnips, parsley root, if using, and garlic in heavy large saucepan. Add 3 cups water and broth; if necessary, add additional water to cover by 1 inch. Boil uncovered until vegetables are tender, about 25 minutes. Drain vegetables, reserving liquid.
Return vegetables to pot. Add cream and butter. Set over low heat; mash until mixture is smooth; and fluffy, adding enough reserved cooking liquid to thin to desired consistency. Mix in 2 tablespoons parsley. (Can be made 2 hours ahead. Cover; let stand at room temperature. Rewarm over low heat, stirring.) Transfer to bowl. Top with additional parsley.

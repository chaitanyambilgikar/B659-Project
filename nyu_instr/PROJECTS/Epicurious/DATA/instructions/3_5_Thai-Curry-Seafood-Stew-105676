Place curry paste in large pot. Whisk in 1/2 cup coconut milk. Bring to boil; boil 1 minute. Stir in remaining 2 cups coconut milk and 1 cup water. Add broccoli slaw, shrimp, and scallops. Top with mussels. Return to boil. Reduce heat to low; cover and simmer until mussels open and seafood is cooked, about 3 minutes. Discard unopened mussels. Add basil, lime juice, and fish sauce, if desired. Season with salt and pepper.
Press hot rice into four 2/3-cup custard cups, dividing equally. Invert cups to unmold rice into 4 bowls. Spoon stew around rice and serve.

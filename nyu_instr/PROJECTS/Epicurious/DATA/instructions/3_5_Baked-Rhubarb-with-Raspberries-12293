Preheat the oven to 350°F. In a blender purée the raspberries with the brown sugar and the water, strain the purée through a sieve into a bowl, pressing hard on the solids, and stir in the butter, the vanilla, and the rhubarb. Transfer the mixture to an 11- by 7-inch baking dish and bake the dessert in the middle of the oven, stirring very gently after 15 minutes, for 30 minutes, or until the rhubarb is soft. Let the dessert cool for 10 minutes and serve it with the ice cream or whipped cream.

Core 2 of the apples and cut them crosswise with a hand-held slicing device into 1/8-inch-thick rings, discarding the ends. Butter a jelly-roll pan with 1 tablespoon of the butter and in it arrange the apple rings in one layer. Pour 1/4 cup of the lemon juice over the apple rings, turn the rings to coat them with the juice, and broil them under a preheated broiler about 4 inches from the heat for 6 minutes, or until the edges just begin to turn golden. Sprinkle about 1/4 teaspoon of sugar over each ring, broil the rings for 2 minutes more, or until they are glazed and golden, and transfer them to another jelly-roll pan to cool. Make more glazed apple rings in the same manner with the remaining apples, butter, lemon juice, and sugar. The glazed apple rings may be made 3 hours in advance, kept covered loosely at room temperature, and, if desired, reheated, arranged decoratively into 6 clusters of overlapping rings, in a buttered jelly-roll pan in a preheated 350°F. oven for 10 minutes before serving.

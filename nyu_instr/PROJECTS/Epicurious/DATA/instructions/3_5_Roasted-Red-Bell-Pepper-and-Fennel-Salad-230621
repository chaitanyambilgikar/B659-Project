Char bell peppers over open flame or in broiler until blackened on all sides. Enclose peppers in paper bag 10 minutes. Peel and seed peppers, then cut into 3/4-inch-wide strips.
Whisk lemon juice, oil, garlic, and dried crushed pepper in small bowl to blend. Season to taste with salt and pepper. (Peppers and dressing can be made 1 day ahead. Cover separately and chill. Bring dressing to room temperature and rewhisk before using.)
Toss sliced fennel bulb with half of dressing in medium bowl. Toss red peppers with remaining dressing in another medium bowl.
Divide greens among 4 plates. Arrange fennel and red peppers over. Sprinkle reserved fennel fronds, olives, and Parmesan shavings over. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and serve.

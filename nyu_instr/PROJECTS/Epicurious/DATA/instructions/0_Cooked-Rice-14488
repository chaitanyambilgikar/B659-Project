In a 5-quart heavy kettle bring water with rice to a boil over moderately high heat and boil mixture, uncovered and undisturbed, until water has evaporated and steam holes appear on surface of rice, about 8 minutes. Reduce heat to low and cook rice, covered and undisturbed, 15 minutes. Fluff rice with a fork.

Whisk together cream and 2 teaspoons flour in a small bowl until just combined.
Cook shallot in butter in a 9- to 10-inch heavy skillet over moderately low heat, stirring occasionally, until shallot is softened, about 3 minutes. Add spinach, nutmeg, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and cook, stirring constantly, until excess liquid is evaporated, about 2 minutes. Stir cream mixture, then add to spinach and cook, stirring occasionally, until cream is slightly thickened, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat.
Stir together bread crumbs, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper in a shallow bowl. Spread remaining 1/2 cup flour on a plate and set aside for dredging.
Gently blot any water from top of poached eggs with paper towels, then sprinkle with remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper.
Carefully dredge 1 poached egg in flour, dusting off excess. Transfer to beaten egg, spooning to coat completely, then transfer with a slotted spoon to bread crumbs, letting excess egg drip off. Coat with crumbs and transfer to a plate. Repeat with remaining poached eggs, 1 at a time.
Cut sliced ham crosswise into 1/4-inch-wide strips.
Heat 1 1/2 inches oil in a 3- to 4-quart heavy saucepan (about 1 1/2 inches deep) over high heat until deep-fat thermometer registers 375°F. Fry ham in oil, stirring occasionally with a clean slotted spoon to separate strips, until crisp, 15 to 20 seconds. Transfer ham to paper towels to drain.
Return frying oil to 375°F.
Lower 2 eggs (1 at a time on slotted spoon) into hot oil and fry until golden brown, 15 to 20 seconds. Transfer fried eggs to paper towels to drain. Repeat with remaining 2 eggs.
Reheat spinach over low heat, stirring constantly and adding more cream or water to loosen mixture if necessary, about 1 minute.
Divide creamed spinach among 4 plates, then top with poached eggs and ham.

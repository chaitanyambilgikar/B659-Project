Arrange the peppers on a grill rack above a charcoal fire, on wire racks positioned over the burners of a gas or electric stove, 2 to 3 inches under a preheated broiler, or in an oven preheated to 400°F. Roast them until they are charred all over and tender inside, turning them frequently to ensure that they blacken evenly, about 30 minutes in the oven, but less time by the other methods. When the peppers are cool enough to handle, peel off the skins using your fingertips, cut the peppers in half, and remove and discard the stems, ribs, and seeds. (Do not do this under running water; it will wash away some of the delicious smoky flavor.)
Cut the roasted, peeled, and seeded peppers into long strips about 3/4 inch wide. Arrange them on a plate. Drizzle lightly with olive oil and strew with olives and parsley. Serve at room temperature.

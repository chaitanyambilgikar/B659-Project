Boil apple juice and wine in heavy large saucepan until reduced to 3/4 cup, about 30 minutes. Whisk in butter.
Preheat oven to 425°F. Peel and cut vegetables into 1/2-inch pieces. Divide between 2 large roasting pans. Pour apple juice mixture over vegetables. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Toss to coat. Roast until vegetables are tender and golden, stirring occasionally, about 40 minutes.

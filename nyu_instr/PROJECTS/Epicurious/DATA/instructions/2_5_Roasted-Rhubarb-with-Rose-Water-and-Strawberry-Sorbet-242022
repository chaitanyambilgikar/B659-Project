Make sorbet: Cook water and sugar in a small heavy saucepan over medium heat, stirring, until sugar has dissolved. Remove from heat and cool syrup completely.
Purée strawberries with syrup in a food processor until smooth, then force through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl and stir in lemon juice. If mixture isn't already cold, quick-chill by putting bowl in an ice bath and stirring occasionally for about 15 minutes.
Freeze mixture in ice cream maker, then transfer to an airtight container and put in freezer to harden, at least 3 hours.
Roast rhubarb while sorbet freezes: Preheat oven to 400°F with rack in middle.
Whisk together sugar and potato starch in a 13- by 9-inch shallow baking dish. Add rhubarb and toss. Roast until rhubarb is just tender (not falling apart), 20 to 25 minutes.
Cool to warm, about 30 minutes, then sprinkle rose water over rhubarb. Serve rhubarb and its juices with sorbet.

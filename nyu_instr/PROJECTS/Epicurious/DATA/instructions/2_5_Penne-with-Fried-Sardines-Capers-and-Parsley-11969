Bring a kettle of salted water to a boil. Cook pasta until al dente and drain well in a colander. In a bowl toss together pasta, parsley, onion, capers, and salt and pepper to taste. Drizzle mixture with lemon juice and olive oil and toss to combine.
In a 9- to 10-inch heavy deep skillet heat 1/2 inch vegetable oil over high heat until hot but not smoking and gently lower half of sardines with a slotted spoon into oil. Fry sardines until crisp and golden, about 1 minute, and transfer with slotted spoon to paper towels to drain. Fry and drain remaining sardines in same manner. Add sardines to pasta and toss to combine.

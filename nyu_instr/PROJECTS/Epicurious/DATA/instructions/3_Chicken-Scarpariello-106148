Hack each thigh in half (or into thirds if large) across the bone with a cleaver or a sharp heavy knife. Pat chicken dry and season with salt and pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then sauté chicken in 2 batches, beginning skin sides down, turning occasionally and adjusting heat to keep from burning, until cooked through and well browned on all sides, 10 to 12 minutes (add another tablespoon oil to skillet for second batch). Transfer chicken as cooked with tongs to a plate and keep warm, covered with foil.
Pour off all but 1 tablespoon fat from skillet. Add remaining tablespoon oil and cook onion, bell peppers, and cherry peppers (to taste) over moderate heat, covered, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 7 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring, until garlic is golden, about 2 minutes. Add wine and broth and boil, uncovered, until most of liquid is evaporated, about 4 minutes. Add chicken (with any juices accumulated on plate) and parsley and cook over moderate heat, stirring, until heated through, then season with salt.

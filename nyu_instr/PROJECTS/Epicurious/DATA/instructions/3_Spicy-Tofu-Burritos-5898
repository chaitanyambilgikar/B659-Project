Preheat oven to 350°F. Wrap tortillas in foil. Place in oven until heated through, about 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and sauté until golden, about 5 minutes. Add cumin and turmeric; stir 30 seconds. Add tofu, bell pepper, jalapeño and garlic and sauté until heated through, about 3 minutes. Add cheese and stir until melted, about 1 minute. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Spoon tofu mixture down center of each tortilla, dividing tofu equally. Top with lettuce and cilantro. Squeeze juice from lime wedges over. Wrap tortilla around filling and serve.

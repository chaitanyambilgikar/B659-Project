Whisk lemon juice, capers, shallot, mustard, and dried red pepper in medium bowl. Whisk in oil, then basil. Season dressing to taste with salt and pepper.
Bring large saucepan of salted water to boil. Add shrimp and cook 1 minute. Add zucchini; continue cooking until shrimp are opaque in center and zucchini is crisp-tender, about 1 minute longer. Drain. Rinse under cold water and cool. Drain well. Transfer to large bowl. Add 1/3 cup dressing and toss to coat. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Toss greens in large bowl with enough dressing to coat. Divide greens among 4 plates. Arrange shrimp and zucchini atop greens. Serve, passing Parmesan cheese separately, if desired.

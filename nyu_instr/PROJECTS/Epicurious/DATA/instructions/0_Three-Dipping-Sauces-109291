For Ginger and Shallot Oil: Heat the peanut oil in a wok and fry the chillies until they blacken. Discard the chillies and allow the oil to cool. In a mortar and pestle crush all the other ingredients lightly. As the oil cools add to the mortar and mix well. Leave for a little while to allow the flavours to marry.
Very good on boiled and fried dishes, and a great dressing for grilled scallop salad.
For Black Vinegar and Ginger Sauce: Mix the diced ginger with the vinegar and allow to stand for 1 hour before serving.
You'll find this easy to make but very effective on boiled meats.
For Bean Paste Sauce: In a wok, heat up the peanut oil and fry the spring onions, ginger, garlic and chillies for 3 minutes. Add all the other ingredients and reduce the sauce by half. Remove from the heat and cool.
Can be used as a cold dipping sauce or heated up and tossed with steamed vegetables.

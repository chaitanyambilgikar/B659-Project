1. Beat the egg well. Then add salt, wine, and gradually the flour until you have a sticky elastic dough, almost like the consistency of molasses.
2. Flour your hands and break off pieces not much bigger than a marble. Roll out paper-thin on a floured surface. Cut in segments approximately 2 by 4 inches (dough the size of a large marble will make about 3), or cut on the diagonal very thin strips or whatever shape you wish.
3. Pour about 2 inches of oil into a heavy frying pan and heat to 375 degrees. Slide the strips carefully into the hot oil. Let cook a few seconds on each side. Soon they will bubble and puff up like hazenblosen. Remove with a spatula and drain on paper towels. When cool sprinkle with confectioners' sugar. Eat immediately or let sit, covered well, for one day with plastic wrap.

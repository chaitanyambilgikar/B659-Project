Preheat oven to 375°F. Mash bread, eggs and 3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce in large bowl until smooth paste forms. Mix in onion, 1/3 cup ketchup, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Add beef and mix thoroughly. Mound meat mixture in 13x9x2-inch baking pan, shaping into 8x4-inch loaf. Spread remaining 1 tablespoon ketchup over meat loaf.
Pour broth and remaining 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce into pan around meat loaf. Arrange vegetables around meat loaf. Cover pan with foil. Bake 45 minutes.

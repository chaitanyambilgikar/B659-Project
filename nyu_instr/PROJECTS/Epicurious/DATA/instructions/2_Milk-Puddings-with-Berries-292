Using vegetable peeler, remove peel in long strips from lemon. Combine whole milk, 1 cup low-fat milk, 1/3 cup sugar and lemon peel in medium saucepan. Scrape seeds from vanilla bean into milk mixture; add bean. Bring to boil. Remove from heat; cover and let steep 45 minutes. Remove vanilla bean.
Place remaining 1/2 cup low-fat milk in small bowl. Sprinkle gelatin over and let stand until gelatin softens, about 5 minutes; stir to blend. Bring milk mixture in saucepan to simmer. Remove from heat; immediately add gelatin mixture and whisk until gelatin dissolves. Pour mixture through strainer set over 4-cup measuring cup. Rinse six 3/4-cup ramekins, dividing equally. Refrigerate overnight until puddings are set. (Can be prepared 2 days ahead. Cover and keep refrigerated.)
Combine berries and remaining 2 tablespoons sugar in medium bowl. Let stand 30 minutes. Spoon berry mixture atop puddings in ramekins and serve.

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Stir maple syrup, chili sauce, vinegar and mustard in small saucepan until well blended. Brush chicken with oil; season with salt and pepper. Arrange chicken on barbecue. Grill until cooked through, turning occasionally and brushing generously with sauce, about 10 minutes. Serve immediately.

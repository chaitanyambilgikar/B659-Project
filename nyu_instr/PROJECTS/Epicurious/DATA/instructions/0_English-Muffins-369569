Combine the masa harina, water, and salt and mix well. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside.
Allow the bread dough to rise in a warm place for an hour.
Mix the masa harina dough and the White Bread dough together by hand until uniform. Place a 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Scoop out 1/3 cup dough at a time and roll it into a 2-inch ball. Place 4 or 5 balls in the pan at a time (evenly spaced apart and not touching) and flatten slightly with the palm of your hand to form 3-inch discs. Cook for 5 to 7 minutes, then flip over with a spatula and cook for 5 to 6 minutes more, until dry to the touch on both sides.

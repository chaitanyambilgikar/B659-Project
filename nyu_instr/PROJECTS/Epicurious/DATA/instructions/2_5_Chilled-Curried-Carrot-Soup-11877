In a saucepan cook the onion in the oil over moderately low heat, stirring, until it is softened. Add the carrots, the curry powder, and the chutney and cook the mixture, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the broth, the water, and salt and pepper to taste and simmer the mixture, covered for 15 minutes, or until the carrots are very tender. In a blender purée the mixture in batches with the ice cubes, the lemon juice, and salt to taste for 1 minute, or until it is smooth, transferring the soup as it is puréed to a metal bowl set in a larger bowl of ice and cold water. Chill the soup, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes, or until it is cold, divide it between 2 chilled bowls, and sprinkle it with the coriander and the peanuts.

Preheat oven to 325°F with rack in middle.
Pat pork dry and sprinkle with 3/4 teaspoon salt. Roast in a small flameproof roasting pan tightly covered with foil, covered, 2 hours. Uncover and continue roasting until some of the meat begins to pull apart easily, 1 to 2 hours more. Transfer pork to a cutting board and cool slightly. Pull pork into small pieces and coarsely chop.
Cook orecchiette in a large pot of boiling salted water (2 tablespoons salt for 6 quarts water) 8 minutes (pasta will not be fully cooked). Reserving 2 cups pasta-cooking liquid, drain pasta in a colander.
Pour off all but 3 tablespoon fat from roasting pan and place pan over medium-high heat. Add onion, celery, and 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 8 to 10 minutes. Add garlic and oregano and cook, stirring, 3 minutes. Add tomato paste and cook, stirring, 3 minutes. Stir in wine, broth, beans, vinegar, and pork. Transfer to pasta pot and simmer uncovered for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add 1 cup reserved cooking liquid and bring to a simmer, then add orecchiette and cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente. Remove from heat and stir in cheese and olive oil. Season with salt and pepper and thin sauce with additional cooking liquid if necessary. Serve with additional cheese.

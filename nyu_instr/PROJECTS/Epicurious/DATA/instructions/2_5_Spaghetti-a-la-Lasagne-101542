Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil for the pasta. Heat the tomato sauce in a small saucepan. (Or do this at the last minute in a microwave for 1 minute.)
Add the pasta to the boiling water and cook until it is tender but still firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine the olive oil, ricotta, and Parmesan in a small mixing bowl and season to taste with salt and pepper.
When the pasta is done, drain it and return it to the pot, off the heat. Add the spaghetti sauce and toss well.
Ladle the pasta and sauce into deep bowls, and top each portion with a dollop of the ricotta mixture.

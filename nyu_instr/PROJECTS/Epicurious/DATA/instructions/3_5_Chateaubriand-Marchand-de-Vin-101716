Prepare beef: Broil the Chateaubriands. During the cooking, brush them frequently with melted butter and turn them often. Meanwhile, extract the marrow and slice it in thin rounds. Poach these for about 1 minute in boiling salted water.
Prepare sauce: Sauté green onions in 1/4 pound butter until just colored. Add red wine and cook this down to one half its volume. Add gravy, cognac, pat of butter and the lemon. Sprinkle the sauce heavily with parsley.
When the meat is done to your satisfaction, remove it to hot plates, pour the sauce over each portion and top with slices of poached marrow. With this serve lyonnaise potatoes, watercress, crisp French bread, fruit and cheese. Try a fine bottle of Bordeaux with this.

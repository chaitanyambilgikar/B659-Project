In a bowl whisk together the mayonnaise, the chili sauce, the scallion, the parsley, the bell pepper, the lemon juice, the horseradish, the Worcestershire sauce, and salt and pepper to taste, fold in the hearts of palm and the crab meat, and combine the mixture gently but thoroughly. The crab salad may be made 1 day in advance and kept covered and chilled.
Transfer the crab salad to a platter lined with the watercress and serve it with the cucumber slices and the pita wedges.

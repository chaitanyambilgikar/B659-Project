Fill a 4-quart pasta pot three fourths full with salted water and bring to a boil for orzo.
In a small heavy skillet heat 1/2 tablespoon oil over moderate heat until hot but not smoking and sauté pine nuts with salt to taste, stirring frequently, until golden, about 2 minutes. Transfer nuts to paper towels to drain and cool.
Mince garlic and chop parsley. Quarter tomatoes and coarsely crumble feta. In a large bowl whisk together garlic, parsley, vinegar, remaining tablespoon oil, and salt and pepper to taste. Add tomatoes and feta and gently toss to combine.
Cook orzo in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until al dente. In a large sieve drain orzo and rinse slightly until just warm. Drain orzo well and add to tomato mixture, tossing until just combined.
Serve orzo topped with nuts.

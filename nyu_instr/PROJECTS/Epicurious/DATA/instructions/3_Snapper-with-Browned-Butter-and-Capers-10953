Preheat oven to 350°F.
In a small skillet cook butter over moderate heat until it begins to brown and stir in shallot. Cook shallot until softened but not browned, about 2 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and stir in lemon juice.
In a small bowl stir together parsley, capers, lemon pulp, and zest.
Put fish fillets in a jelly-roll pan, skin sides down, and sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste. Brush fillets with butter mixture and sprinkle with parsley mixture. Bake fillets in middle of oven until just cooked through, about 12 minutes, and garnish with lemon slices.

For Crust: Mix flour, cake flour, 1 tablespoon sugar and salt in processor. Add chilled butter and shortening and cut in, using on/off turns, until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add 3 tablespoons ice water and process until moist clumps form. If dough is too dry, add more water by teaspoonfuls. Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate 1 hour. (Can be prepared 2 days ahead. Keep refrigerated. Let dough soften slightly at room temperature before rolling out.)
Position rack in bottom third of oven; preheat oven to 350°F. Butter 9-inch-diameter glass pie dish. Roll out dough on lightly floured work surface to 12-inch round. Transfer to prepared dish. Trim crust edge, leaving 1/2-inch overhang. Decoratively crimp overhang. Freeze 15 minutes.
Line crust with foil. Fill with dried beans or pie weights. Bake until crust is set and rim is pale golden, about 20 minutes. Remove foil and beans. Cool completely. Maintain oven temperature.
For Filling: Using electric mixer, beat eggs, egg yolks and salt in large bowl to blend. Add 1 1/4 cups sugar and beat until mixture is thick and fluffy, about 1 minute. Beat in coconut, 1/4 cup chilled whipping cream, lemon juice, melted better, lemon peel, 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla and almond extract.
Pour filling into crust. Bake until filling is golden and set, about 40 minutes. Cool on rack. Refrigerate until well chilled, about 3 hours. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and keep refrigerated.)
Beat remaining 3/4 cup cream, powdered sugar and remaining 3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract in large bowl until stiff peaks form. Pipe whipped cream around border of pie. Garnish with lemon slices and serve.

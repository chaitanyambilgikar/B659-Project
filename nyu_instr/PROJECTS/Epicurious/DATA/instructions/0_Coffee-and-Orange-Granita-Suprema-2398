Mix coffee, 1/2 cup sugar, grated orange peel and ground cinnamon in medium bowl until sugar dissolves. Cool to room temperature. Transfer mixture to loaf pan. Freeze until granita is consistency of shaved ice, stirring mixture with fork and breaking frozen edge pieces every 30 minutes, about 3 hours. (Granita can be made 6 hours ahead. If possible, stir every 30 minutes to 1 hour. Before serving, blend mixture in processor to break up ice.)
Beat chilled whipping cream and 3 tablespoons sugar in medium bowl until soft peaks form. Add Grand Marnier and beat until soft peaks form again. Spoon granita into bowls. Top each dessert with dollop of whipped cream. Garnish with chocolate curls and orange peel strips and serve immediately.

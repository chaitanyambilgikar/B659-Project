Heat sesame oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper. Add chicken and onion to skillet and sauté 3 minutes. Stir in kumquats. Remove from heat. Cool. Stir in bean sprouts.
Toss basil and mint in small bowl to combine. Dip 1 rice paper round into bowl of warm water until soft, about 10 seconds. Place on clean, moist kitchen towel to drain 1 minute. Repeat with another rice paper round. Place second round atop first round for double thickness. Top with a lettuce leaf, then place 1/8 of chicken-bean sprout mixture near lower edge of round. Sprinkle with 1/8 of herb mixture. Fold in sides of round, then roll up, starting near filling. Repeat with remaining rounds, lettuce leaves, chicken-bean sprout mixture, and herb mixture. (Can be made 3 hours ahead. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate.)
Whisk hoisin sauce and chili-garlic paste in medium bowl to blend. Slice each roll diagonally into 4 pieces, for a total of 32 pieces. Pour sauce into individual shallow bowls and place in center of each of 8 plates; surround with spring rolls and serve.

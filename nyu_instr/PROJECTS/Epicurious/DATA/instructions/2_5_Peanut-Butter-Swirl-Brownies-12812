In a bowl cream together 1/2 stick of the butter, the peanut butter, and the brown sugar and beat in 1 of the eggs and the cream cheese, a little at a time, beating until the mixture is smooth. In a small saucepan melt 1 stick of the remaining butter with the chocolate over low heat, stirring until the mixture is smooth, and let the chocolate mixture cool. In another bowl cream together remaining 1 stick butter and the granulated sugar, beating until the mixture is light and fluffy, and beat in the remaining 2 eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the chocolate mixture, the vanilla, and the flour, sifted, and pour the batter into a buttered 13- by 9-inch baking pan. Drop dollops of the peanut butter mixture into the batter, swirling the peanut butter mixture to marble the batter, bake the brownies in the middle of a preheated 350°F. oven for 45 to 50 minutes, or until they pull away slightly from the sides of the pan and a tester comes out with crumbs adhering to it, and let them cool before cutting them into squares.

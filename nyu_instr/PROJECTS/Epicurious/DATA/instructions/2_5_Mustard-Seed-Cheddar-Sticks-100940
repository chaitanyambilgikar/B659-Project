Preheat oven to 400°F. and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
Cut butter into bits and in a food processor pulse with flour, 1 teaspoon salt, and cayenne until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add Cheddar and pulse until mixture forms a dough. Form dough into a disk. Chill dough, wrapped in plastic wrap, until firm, at least 30 minutes, and up to 2 days.
On a lightly floured surface with a lightly floured rolling pin roll out dough into a 16- by 4-inch rectangle (about 1/4 inch thick). Trim edges of rectangle and lightly brush rectangle with water. Sprinkle rectangle with mustard seeds and remaining 2 teaspoons salt. Gently roll rolling pin over dough to make seeds and salt adhere.
With a sharp long knife cut rectangle crosswise into roughly 1/3-inch-wide sticks. Transfer sticks with a spatula to baking sheet and arrange about 3/4 inch apart. Bake sticks in middle of oven until golden, about 10 minutes, and transfer to a rack to cool. Cheddar sticks may be kept in an airtight container at cool room temperature 1 week, or frozen 1 month.

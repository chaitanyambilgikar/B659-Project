Combine the oil and flour in a large, heavy pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Stirring slowly and constantly, make a medium-brown roux the color of peanut butter. This will take about 30 minutes.
Add the onions and bell peppers, and cook, stirring, until the vegetables are wilted and lightly golden, about 5 minutes. Add the celery and garlic cloves. Cook, stirring, for 3 to 4 minutes. Add the shrimp stock or water, bay leaves, thyme, and salt. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, covered, for 45 minutes.
Add the shrimp and crabmeat and simmer until the shrimp turn pink, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the oysters and their liquor and simmer until the edges of the oysters curl, about 3 minutes. Remove and discard the bay leaves and thyme. Garnish with the parsley and green onions. Serve the gumbo over rice. Additional Tabasco and filé powder can be passed at the table to allow each guest to season according to taste.

Make filling: Chop chocolate and in a heavy saucepan bring cream just to a boil. Reduce heat to low and add chocolate, stirring until mixture is smooth. Transfer filling to a bowl and cool slightly. Chill filling, its surface covered with plastic wrap, at least 4 hours, or until completely cold, and up to 3 days.
Put tartlet shells on a tray. With an electric mixer beat filling 30 seconds, or until pale and thickened (do not overbeat or it will become grainy). Transfer filling to a pastry bag fitted with 1/2-inch plain tip and pipe a small dollop into each shell. Press 2 or 3 raspberries into filling in each shell and pipe more filling 2 inches high into each shell, making sure filling touches insides of shells all the way around (to firmly anchor it). Chill tartlets until filling is firm, about 1 hour.
Make glaze: Chop chocolate and cut butter into pieces. In a double boiler or a metal bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water combine all glaze ingredients, stirring until mixture is smooth. Transfer glaze to a small saucepan and cool to barely warm. Glaze may be made 1 week ahead and chilled, covered. Reheat glaze over low heat to barely warm before proceeding.
To glaze tartlets: Holding saucepan at an angle and working quickly, dip top of 1 tartlet into glaze until filling is submerged almost to shell, holding tartlet over glaze a few seconds to let excess glaze drip back into pan. Repeat procedure with remaining tartlets. Chill tartlets until glaze is set, about 15 minutes. Tartlets may be made 1 day ahead and chilled in airtight containers. Keep tartlets chilled until ready to serve.

Halve calf fries lengthwise with a sharp knife, then pat dry with paper towels. Season flour with salt and pepper and dredge fries to lightly coat, shaking off excess.
Heat oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat until hot but not smoking, then sauté fries in 2 batches until golden brown on both sides and cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to paper towels to drain.
Purée fries in a food processor with remaining ingredients until smooth and transfer to a serving bowl. Chill, covered, until firm, at least 4 hours. Bring to room temperature before serving.

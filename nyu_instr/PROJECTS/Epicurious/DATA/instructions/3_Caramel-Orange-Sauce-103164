Stir sugar and water in heavy medium saucepan over medium-low heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat; boil without stirring until syrup turns deep amber, occasionally brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush and swirling pan, about 9 minutes. Remove from heat. Gradually add cream (mixture will bubble vigorously). Stir over low heat until smooth. Remove from heat. Whisk in liqueur. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Cover sauce and refrigerate. Stir over low heat to rewarm before serving.)

Dredge the cutlets in the flour, shaking off the excess. In a heavy skillet heat the butter and the oil over moderately high heat until the foam subsides, in the fat sauté the cutlets for 2 minutes on each side, or until they are just cooked through, and transfer them with a slotted spatula to a small platter. Deglaze the skillet with the Sherry over moderately high heat, stirring and scraping up the brown bits, add the peppercorns, and boil the sauce until the liquid is reduced to about 2 tablespoons. Stir in the honey or sugar and the broth and boil the sauce until it is reduced to about 1/4 cup. Season the sauce with salt and pepper and spoon it over the cutlets.

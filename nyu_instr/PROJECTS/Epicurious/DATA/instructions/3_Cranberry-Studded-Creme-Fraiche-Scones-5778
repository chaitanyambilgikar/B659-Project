Preheat oven to 350°F. Whisk first 5 ingredients in large bowl to blend. Rub in butter with fingertips until mixture resembles fine meal. Mix in cranberries.
Separate 1 egg; place white in small bowl and reserve. Place yolk in medium bowl. Whisk whole egg, crème fraîche and vanilla into yolk. Gently stir crème fraîche mixture into flour mixture (dough will be very moist). Turn dough out onto generously floured work surface. Divide dough in half. Press each half into 6-inch round about 1/2 inch thick. Cut each round into 6 wedges. Beat reserved white until foamy; brush over wedges. Sprinkle with sugar. Transfer wedges to baking sheet, spacing 1 inch apart.
Bake scones until pale golden and toothpick inserted into center comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Serve scones warm or at room temperature.

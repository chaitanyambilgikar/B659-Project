Season chicken with salt and pepper. Heat oil in heavy large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Working in batches, add chicken and brown on all sides, about 5 minutes per batch. Transfer chicken to plate. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons fat from Dutch oven. Add salt pork; sauté until golden, about 5 minutes. Add onion and sauté until almost tender and golden, 6 minutes. Add tomatoes with their juices, broth, wine, thyme, garlic and bay leaves and bring to boil. Return chicken to Dutch oven. Cover and simmer until chicken is cooked through, about 20 minutes.
Transfer chicken to large bowl. Add olives to Dutch oven and boil until mixture is reduced to 3 cups, about 25 minutes. Mix in basil. Return chicken to Dutch oven and stir until heated through, about 3 minutes. Transfer chicken to shallow serving bowl. Spoon sauce over and serve.

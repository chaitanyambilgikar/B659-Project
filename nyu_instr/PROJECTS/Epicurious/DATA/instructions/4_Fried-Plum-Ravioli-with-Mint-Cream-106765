Make ravioli: Drain preserves in a coarse sieve set over a bowl, pressing lightly on solids, and reserve syrup. Transfer drained preserves to a bowl and stir in chopped plums.
Put 1 wonton wrapper on a lightly floured surface, keeping remaining wrappers covered with plastic wrap, and put a rounded teaspoon of plum mixture in center. Lightly dampen edges of wrapper with a fingertip dipped in water and fold wrapper in half to form a triangle, pressing down around filling to force out air and pressing edges together firmly to seal. Transfer to a dry kitchen towel and make 11 more ravioli in same manner.
Fry ravioli: Heat 2 inches oil in a 4-quart heavy pot until it registers 375°F on deep-fat thermometer. Fry ravioli in 4 batches, turning them, until golden, about 1 1/2 minutes. Transfer as fried with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain.
Crush mint leaves in lemon juice using mortar and pestle, then transfer to a bowl. Whisk in cream and confectioners sugar and whisk until soft peaks form.
Dust ravioli with confectioners sugar, drizzle plum syrup around them, and dollop mint cream on the side.

Preheat oven to 350°F. Spray six 3/4-cup ramekins or custard cups with nonstick spray. Place cups in 13x9x2-inch baking pan. Scrape seeds from vanilla bean into small saucepan; add bean. Mix in 1/2 cup cream and white chocolate. Stir over low heat just until smooth. Set aside.
Whisk 1 1/4 cups cream, sugar, yolks, egg, sour cream, rum and salt in medium bowl until smooth. Strain white chocolate mixture into egg mixture and whisk to blend. Pour 1/4 cup custard mixture into each ramekins; reserve remaining custard. Pour enough hot water into baking pan to come halfway up sides of ramekins. Bake until custards set, about 30 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes.
Add espresso to remaining custard mixture; stir until dissolved. Spoon espresso custard over white chocolate custards, dividing equally.
Bake until custards set, about 30 minutes. Remove from water. Chill uncovered until cold, about 3 hours. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover; keep chilled.)
Cut around ramekin sides to loosen custards. Turn out onto plates.

Preheat oven to 400°F. Using spoon, scrape out seeds from squash; reserve squash seeds. Combine 1 1/2 cups water, squash seeds and 1 tablespoon salt in small saucepan. Bring to boil. Strain seeds; rinse under cold water to remove any squash pieces from seeds. Pat seeds dry with paper towel. Toss seeds with 1/2 teaspoon oil in small bowl. Sprinkle with salt. Transfer to baking sheet. Place squash on baking sheet. Brush with 1 tablespoon oil. Roast seeds until toasted, about 6 minutes. Roast squash until tender and lightly browned, turning once, about 45 minutes. Cut squash into 3/4-inch pieces.
Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add onions, 1 1/3 cups corn, garlic, coriander, cardamom, cumin, cayenne and cloves; sauté until onions are tender, about 8 minutes. Add squash and 6 cups water. Bring to boil. Reduce heat; simmer 30 minutes.
Working in batches, puree chowder in processor until smooth. Return chowder to same pot. Bring to boil. Reduce heat. Add potato and remaining 2/3 cup corn kernels; simmer until potato is cooked through, thinning chowder with more water if necessary, about 12 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Spoon chowder into bowls. Garnish with toasted squash seeds and serve.

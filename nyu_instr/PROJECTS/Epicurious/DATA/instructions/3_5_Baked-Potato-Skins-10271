Prick the potatoes a few times with a fork and bake them in the middle of a preheated 425°F. oven for 1 hour. Let the potatoes cool, halve them lengthwise, and scoop them out, leaving a 1/4-inch shell and reserving the potato pulp for another use. Cut each shell lengthwise into 6 strips and arrange the strips on a baking sheet. Brush the strips with the oil, sprinkle them with paprika, the salt, and pepper to taste, and bake them in the middle of the preheated 425°F. oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until they are crisp and golden brown. Serve the potato skins with the sour cream.

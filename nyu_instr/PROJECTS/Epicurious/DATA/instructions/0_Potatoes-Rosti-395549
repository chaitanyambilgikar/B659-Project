Preheat the oven to 400°F/200°C/gas 6.
Cut the potatoes into thin matchsticks using a julienne attachment on a mandoline or food processor. Or, cut into thin rounds and use a sharp knife to cut the rounds into strips {more time consuming, but it works!}
Heat the butter and olive oil in an 8-in/20-cm ovenproof cast-iron or non-stick frying pan, over medium heat. Add the rosemary to the potatoes, and season with salt and pepper. Increase the heat to medium-high and cook, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes are soft and a few pieces are brown. At this point, the potatoes should have settled into a round flat pancake.
Transfer the potatoes in the skillet to the hot oven to bake until the top and bottom are golden and crispy and the center is soft but cooked through, about 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and slide out of the pan onto paper towels/absorbent papers. Slide onto a baking sheet/tray and continue until the top and bottom are cooked to a deep golden brown, about 10 minutes more. Serve in wedges or whole on a plate in the middle of the table for breaking and nibbling.

Scrape cobs with a knife over a bowl to extract "milk." Blend corn and its milk with remaining ingredients and a pinch of salt in a blender until smooth. Force through a sieve into a heavy medium saucepan, pressing hard on and then discarding solids. Bring mixture to a boil over medium heat, whisking constantly, then boil, whisking, 5 minutes. Divide among 6 (6-ounce) custard cups and chill, uncovered, until cool, at least 30 minutes.
Sprinkle with cinnamon before serving.

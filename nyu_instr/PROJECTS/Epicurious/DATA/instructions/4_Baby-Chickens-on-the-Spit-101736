These little delicacies are called poussin, squab chicken, or baby pullets. Plan at least one to a person, and those with hearty appetites could consume as many as three. Spit them, brush them with plenty of seasoned butter and roast them quickly, being careful not to overcook them. Brush frequently during the cooking with melted butter.
Serve these tender bits with tiny new potatoes dressed liberally with butter and chopped parsley, a pleasant summer salad and an Alsatian wine, chilled. French bread, cheese and fresh fruit are a fitting final course. (These tiny chickens are too delicate to be accompanied by foods of strong flavor.)

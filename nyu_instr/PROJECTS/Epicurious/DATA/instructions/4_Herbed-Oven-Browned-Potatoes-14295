Preheat oven to 450°F.
Cut potatoes into 1/4-inch-thick slices and in a saucepan of boiling salted water cook 5 minutes, or until just cooked through. Drain potatoes well in a sieve and transfer to a 6-cup gratin dish (1 1/2-quart) or other shallow baking dish, 11 by 8 by 1 1/2 inches. Toss potatoes immediately with remaining ingredients and pepper and salt to taste and bake in upper third of oven 20 minutes, or until potatoes are pale golden.

In a saucepan combine eggs with enough cold water to cover by 1 inch and bring water just to a boil. Remove pan from heat and let eggs stand, covered, 7 minutes if using quail eggs or 17 minutes if using large eggs. Drain hot water from pan and run cold water over eggs, cracking shells against side of pan. Peel eggs.
Cut a paper-thin slice off both ends of eggs to enable them to stand upright. If using quail eggs, cut one third off narrow end of each, discarding tops; if using large eggs, halve crosswise. Carefully remove yolks from whites and in a bowl mash yolks with a fork. If using quail eggs, stir in smaller measures of mayonnaise, shallot, and tarragon with salt and pepper to taste. If using large eggs, stir in larger measures of same ingredients with salt and pepper to taste. Spoon yolk mixture into whites and smooth tops. Chill stuffed eggs, covered with plastic wrap, at least 30 minutes and up to 4 hours.
Just before serving top eggs with caviar.

Cover lima beans with water by 1 inch in a saucepan and bring just to a boil (if using fresh limas, boil 5 minutes). Reserve 2/3 cup cooking water, then drain in a sieve and rinse under cold water to stop cooking.
Soak bread in 1/2 cup water 1 minute, then squeeze bread dry, discarding soaking water.
Mash garlic to a paste with salt using a mortar and pestle (or mince and mash with a large knife). Blend garlic paste, bread, and lima beans in a food processor until beans are very finely chopped. Blend in egg and 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons vinegar, then add oil in a slow stream with motor running, blending until thick and smooth. Gradually add reserved cooking water and ice water with motor still running, blending until as smooth as possible, about 1 minute.
Force gazpacho through sieve into a bowl, pressing firmly on solids. Discard solids.
Transfer to a glass container and chill, covered, until cold, about 3 hours. Season with salt and vinegar before serving.

Discard shells from eggs and slice each egg in half lengthwise. Remove yolks and arrange whites on a plate.
In a bowl mash yolks with mayonnaise, mustard, hot sauce, and salt and pepper to taste and spoon mixture into whites. Chill deviled eggs, covered, 1 hour.
Just before serving sprinkle eggs with paprika and serve cold.

Sprinkle steaks on both sides with salt and 2 teaspoons pepper; press to adhere. Heat oil in heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add steaks; cook to desired doneness, about 3 minutes per side for medium. Transfer steaks to 2 plates (do not clean skillet). Add 1 tablespoon butter to pan. Add mushrooms and shallot; sauté 2 minutes. Add wine and thyme and boil until wine is reduced by half, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Whisk in 2 tablespoons butter, 1 tablespoon at a time. Season sauce with salt and pepper. Pour over steaks.

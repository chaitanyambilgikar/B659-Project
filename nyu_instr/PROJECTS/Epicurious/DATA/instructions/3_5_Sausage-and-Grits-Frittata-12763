In a small heavy saucepan bring the water to a boil, add the grits and salt to taste, and cook the grits, covered, over low heat, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes, or until they are very thick. Spoon the grits onto a sheet of plastic wrap, using the plastic wrap form them into a 1/2-inch-thick rectangle, and chill them, wrapped in the plastic wrap, for 15 minutes. Cut the grits into 1/2-inch dice.
In a 9-inch non-stick skillet cook the kielbasa and the bell pepper in 1 tablespoon of the oil over moderate heat, stirring, for 5 minutes. In a bowl whisk together the eggs, the scallions, the Cheddar, the cayenne, and salt to taste and stir in the kielbasa mixture and the diced grits, gently. In the skillet heat the remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil over moderate heat until it is hot but not smoking, pour in the egg mixture, and cook the frittata, without stirring, for 8 minutes, or until the edge is set but the center is still soft. If the skillet handle is plastic, wrap it in a double thickness of foil. Broil the frittata under a preheated broiler about 4 inches from the heat for 2 to 3 minutes, or until it is golden, and let it cool in the skillet for 5 minutes. Run a knife around the edge, slide the frittata onto a serving plate, and cut it into wedges. Serve the frittata warm or at room temperature.

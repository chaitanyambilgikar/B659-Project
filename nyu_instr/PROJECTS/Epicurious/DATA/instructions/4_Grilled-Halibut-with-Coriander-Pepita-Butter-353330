Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Place pumpkin seeds and coriander seeds in resealable plastic bag; seal bag, then coarsely crush seeds with rolling pin. Transfer to small saucepan and mix in butter, 1/4 cup cilantro, lime juice, jalapeño chiles, and honey.
Place saucepan with butter mixture at edge of grill to melt, then season with salt and pepper. Place red onions and fish fillets on rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle 4 tablespoons coriander butter over; sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup cilantro and salt and pepper. Grill onions until tender, about 7 minutes per side, and fish until cooked through, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer onions and fish to plates. Spoon remaining coriander butter over.

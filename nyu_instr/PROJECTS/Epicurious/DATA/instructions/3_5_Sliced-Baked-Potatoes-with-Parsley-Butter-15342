Prick the potatoes a few times with a fork and bake them in the middle of a preheated 400°F. oven for 1 hour. In a small saucepan melt the butter and stir in the parsley and salt and pepper to taste. Cut the warm baked potatoes crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices, arrange the slices, overlapping them, on plates, and drizzle each serving with some of the parsley butter.

Bend the outer leaves of the artichokes back until they snap off close to the base and remove several more layers of leaves in the same manner until the white inner leaves are reached. Trim the tips and quarter the artichokes. In a small bowl toss the artichokes with the flour and salt and black pepper to taste. In a skillet heat the oil with the garlic over moderate heat until it is hot but not smoking and cook the garlic until it is softened. Add the artichokes and sauté them over moderately high heat, stirring, for 6 minutes. Stir in the rosemary, the oregano, the basil, and the lemon juice and cook the mixture, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the wine, the red pepper flakes, and salt and black pepper to taste and simmer the mixture, covered, for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the artichokes are very tender. Add the parsley and boil the mixture, uncovered, over high heat for 1 minute, or until it is thickened slightly.

Peel bananas and cut crosswise into 1 1/2-inch pieces. In a bowl cover bananas with rum. Macerate bananas at room temperature 30 minutes.
While bananas are macerating, in a shallow bowl lightly beat egg. In a plastic bag finely crush cornflakes with a rolling pin and transfer to a large shallow bowl.
In a deep 12-inch skillet heat 1 inch oil over moderate heat until a deep-fat thermometer registers 375°F. While oil is heating, carefully remove bananas from rum, reserving rum for another use. Working in small batches, dip bananas in egg to coat, letting excess drip off, and roll in cornflakes, knocking off excess. Arrange bananas as coated on a wax-paper- lined tray.
With a slotted spoon gently lower half of bananas into oil and fry, turning them occasionally, until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer bananas as fried with slotted spoon to paper towels to drain and fry remaining bananas in same manner.

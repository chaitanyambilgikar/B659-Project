In a large bowl stir together the flour, the sugar, the baking powder, the ground cumin, the cuminseed, the mustard, and the salt. In a bowl whisk together the eggs, the milk, and the oil and stir the mixture into the flour mixture, stirring the batter until it is just moistened. Pour the batter into a well-buttered loaf pan, 11 by 4 1/2 by 2 3/4 inches, or 9 by 5 by 3 inches, and b it in the middle of a preheated 350°F oven for 1 hour to 1 hour and 10 minutes, or until a tester comes out clean. Let the bread cool in the pan on a rack for 15 minutes, turn it out onto the rack, and let cool completely.

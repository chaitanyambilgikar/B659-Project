Combine the ingredients in a jar with a tight-fitting lid and place it in a warm spot, such as the top of the refrigerator or near the stove. Allow it to sit undisturbed for at least 12 hours or until thickened but still pourable.
Refrigerate. Crème fraîche will continue to thicken on chilling.
If using the vanilla bean, remove it just before using the crème fraîche and scrape the seeds from the bean into the cream.
To Make Lightly Sweetened Whipped Crème Fraîche: Add 1 tablespoon of sugar and whisk the cream lightly until soft peaks form when the whisk is raised.
STORE Refrigerated, up to 3 weeks.

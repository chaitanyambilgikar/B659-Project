Make marinade: In a bowl or baking dish stir together marinade ingredients until combined.
Add quail, turning to coat. Marinate quail, covered and chilled, turning occasionally, at least 3 hours or overnight.
Make dressing: In a bowl whisk together vinegar and mustard and add oil in a stream, whisking until emulsified. Add orange sections, mango, and pepitas. Chill dressing, covered, about 3 hours to blend flavors.
Prepare grill.
Grill quail in batches on an oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals 5 minutes on each side, or until juices run clear when fleshy part of a thigh is pierced. (Alternatively, cook quail in batches in a cast-iron skillet over moderate heat, turning frequently to avoid burning, about 10 minutes.) Let quail stand 3 minutes.
Toss mesclun with dressing and divide among 4 plates. Top each salad with 2 quail.

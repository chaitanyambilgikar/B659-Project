Sauté bacon in heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat until brown and crisp. Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper-towel-lined plate to drain. Whisk mayonnaise and vinegar in medium bowl. Gradually whisk in oil, then cheese. Season vinaigrette with salt and pepper.
Toss torn lettuce leaves, half of cherries and half of bacon with enough dressing to coat. Divide salad among 6 plates. Top with remaining cherries and bacon and serve.

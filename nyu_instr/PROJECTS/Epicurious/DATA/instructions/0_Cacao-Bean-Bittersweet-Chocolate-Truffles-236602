1. Place cream in a 2-quart wide saucepan add 1/4 cup cacao nibs. Cook over medium heat until it just comes to a simmer. Remove from heat and let sit for 10 minutes; strain out nibs and discard. Reheat to a simmer, remove from the heat, and immediately sprinkle 8 ounces finely chopped chocolate into cream. Cover and allow to sit for 5 minutes; the heat should melt the chocolate. Stir very gently until smooth.
2. Pour mixture into a shallow bowl. Cool to room temperature, cover with plastic wrap, then allow to sit, preferably overnight, until firm enough to roll. (Or you may refrigerate ganache until firm, about 4 hours.)
3. Place remaining nibs and chocolate in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade. Process by pulsing on and off until both are finely ground but not powdery; place in a small bowl. Coat your hands with cocoa powder and roll ganache into 3/4- to 1-inch balls.
4. Toss truffles in chocolate-nib coating. Place in fluted paper cups, if desired, and serve at room temperature.

In a heavy skillet heat the oil over moderately high heat until it is hot but not smoking and in it brown the chicken, patted dry and seasoned with salt and pepper, for 2 minutes on each side. Reduce the heat to moderately low, cook the chicken for 6 minutes more on each side, or until it is cooked through, and transfer it to 2 heated plates.
Cook the almonds in the oil remaining in the skillet over moderate heat, stirring, for 1 minute, or until they are golden, and transfer them with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain. Add to the skillet the wine, the water, and the garlic paste and boil the mixture until it is reduced by half. Remove the skillet from the heat, stir in the butter, the parsley, the almonds, the lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste, and spoon the almond sauce over the chicken.

Preheat oven to 450°F. and line a baking sheet with foil.
Prick potatoes and bake in middle of oven 1 to 1 1/2 hours, or until very soft. Cool potatoes until they can be handled and scoop flesh into a bowl. With an electric mixer beat potatoes with chili paste, butter, and salt and pepper to taste just until smooth and spread in a buttered 2-quart shallow baking dish. Potatoes may be prepared up to this point 1 day ahead and chilled, covered. Bring potatoes to room temperature before proceeding.
Reduce oven temperature to 350°F. Bake potatoes in middle of oven until hot, 20 to 25 minutes.

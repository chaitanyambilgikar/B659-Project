Stir together eggs and tortilla chips.
Cook onion in oil in a 12-inch heavy nonstick skillet over medium heat, stirring, until softened. Add chorizo and cook, breaking up any lumps, just until fresh sausage is no longer pink, about 3 minutes, or dried is heated through, about 1 minute.
Add egg mixture and cook over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until set but still moist, 2 to 3 minutes.

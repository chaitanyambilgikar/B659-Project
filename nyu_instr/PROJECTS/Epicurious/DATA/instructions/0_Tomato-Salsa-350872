In food processor, pulse onion until minced, about 10 seconds. Add tomatoes and pulse just until chunky, about 5 seconds. Add cilantro, lime juice, salt, and pepper and pulse until mixture is mixed, about 5 seconds. Transfer to covered container and refrigerate 2 hours to blend flavors. (Salsa can be made ahead and refrigerated, covered, up to 2 days.)

Stack pita rounds on work surface; cut stack into 8 wedges, forming 32 wedges total. Place pita wedges in single layer on baking sheet. Bake until wedges are crisp and golden, about 10 minutes. Cool completely.

Combine garbanzo beans, 3 tablespoons reserved garbanzo bean liquid, lemon juice, oil, garlic, and cumin in processor. Puree until smooth, adding more garbanzo bean liquid by tablespoonfuls for desired consistency. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer dip to bowl.

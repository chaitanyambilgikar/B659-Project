Cook garlic in 2 tablespoons oil in a small heavy skillet over moderate heat, stirring, until pale golden, about 30 seconds. Transfer garlic with a slotted spoon to a small bowl and reserve oil separately (to prevent garlic from continuing to brown in hot oil).
Simmer 1/4 cup vinegar with shallot and brown sugar in a 1-quart heavy saucepan, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until liquid is reduced to about 1 tablespoon, about 4 minutes.
Add garlic, garlic oil, remaining 1/2 cup olive oil, remaining 1/4 cup vinegar, spices, bay leaves, zests, and olives and bring to a simmer. Transfer mixture to a bowl and cool to warm. Marinate olives, covered and chilled, at least 24 hours.
If desired, reheat in saucepan over low heat, stirring until warm. Transfer with a slotted spoon to a serving dish.

Melt butter in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and sauté until tender, about 4 minutes. Add clam juice and rice and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer until rice is tender, about 15 minutes. Mix in shrimp. Cover and simmer until shrimp are heated through, about 1 minute. Set aside 6 shrimp for garnish.
Working in batches, puree soup with remaining shrimp in blender until smooth. Return soup to same saucepan. Whisk in tomato paste and 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper. Gradually whisk in half and half. Bring soup to a simmer. Season soup to taste with salt and pepper.
Ladle soup into bowls. Garnish with reserved shrimp. Sprinkle with additional cayenne pepper, if desired, and serve.

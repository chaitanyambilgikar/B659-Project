Preheat oven to 400°F. and butter twelve 1/3-cup muffin cups.
In a small bowl stir together 2 tablespoons milk and goat cheese until combined. Into a bowl sift together flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt. Melt butter and in another small bowl whisk together with remaining milk and egg. Finely chop enough scallions to measure 1 cup. Stir butter mixture and scallions into flour mixture until just combined. Divide half of batter evenly among muffin cups and top each with about 2 teaspoons goat cheese filling. Divide remaining batter over filling. Bake muffins in middle of oven until golden and a tester comes out clean, about 20 minutes.

In a kettle of boiling salted water cook beans until just tender, 2 to 4 minutes, and drain. Plunge beans into a bowl of ice and cold water to stop cooking and drain. Beans may be prepared up to this point 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.
In a large heavy skillet heat oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and sauté persimmons until lightly browned and softened, about 4 minutes. Add beans and 1/4 cup chives and sauté, stirring gently, until hot.
Transfer mixture to a platter and sprinkle remaining 1/4 cup chives on top.

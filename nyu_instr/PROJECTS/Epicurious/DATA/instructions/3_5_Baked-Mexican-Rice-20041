Sauté the onion and garlic in hot olive oil until just soft. Add the rice and seasonings and brown lightly. Add the mushrooms and sausage and enough boiling stock to come 1" above the rice. Cover with a tight lid and bake in a 350°F. oven until the liquid is completely absorbed, about 35 minutes. Sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese and serve.

Thinly slice garlic. Soak dried black mushrooms in warm water to cover 15 minutes, or until softened. Rinse black mushrooms to remove any remaining grit and drain. Discard stems from black and fresh mushrooms and thinly slice mushrooms. Mince scallions.
Make seasoning liquid: In a small bowl stir together seasoning liquid ingredients.
Spread rice in a shallow baking pan and separate grains with a fork.
In a deep 12-inch heavy non-stick skillet heat oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and stir-fry garlic and black mushrooms, if using, 15 seconds, or until fragrant. Add fresh mushrooms and stir-fry over high heat until slightly softened, 1 to 2 minutes. Add rice wine or sake and cook, covered, until mushrooms are tender, about 3 minutes. Stir in scallions and cook, uncovered, until almost all liquid is evaporated. Add rice and cook, stirring frequently, 2 to 3 minutes, or until heated through. Stir seasoning liquid and add to fried rice with cilantro, tossing to coat evenly.

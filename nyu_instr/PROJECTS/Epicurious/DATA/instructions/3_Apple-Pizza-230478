Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 400°F.
Roll out pastry sheet into a 15- by 12-inch rectangle on a lightly floured surface with a floured rolling pin. Transfer to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, then prick pastry all over with a fork. Sprinkle bread crumbs over pastry.
Heat butter in a small saucepan over moderate heat, swirling pan, until golden brown, about 1 minute. Pour butter over apples in a bowl, then add sugar and salt and toss to coat. Spread apples evenly over pastry, leaving a 1-inch border on all sides. Fold in edges over apples, pressing down firmly on corners and sides. Bake until apples are tender, 35 to 40 minutes. Sprinkle cheese over apples and bake until cheese is golden and bubbling, 5 to 9 minutes more. Serve warm.

Fill medium bowl with cold water; squeeze in juice of half a lemon. Cut end off stem of 1 artichoke and rub with lemon. Starting from base, bend each leaf back and snap off at natural break until half of length of exposed leaves is light green. Cut off top dark green part of leaves. Trim all dark green areas off artichoke. Rub with lemon. Cut in quarters lengthwise. Cut out any choke and red-tipped leaves and discard. Place in bowl of lemon water. Repeat with remaining artichokes.

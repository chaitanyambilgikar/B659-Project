For dressing: Mix all ingredients in small bowl. Season dressing with salt and pepper.
For crab burgers: Whisk first 7 ingredients in large bowl. Mix in red pepper and green onion. Gently mix in crab and 3/4 cup panko. Sprinkle 1 cup panko on rimmed baking sheet. Using 1/4 cupful for each burger, shape crab mixture into twelve 3-inch patties. Press into crumbs on sheet to coat both sides; keep crab burgers on sheet. Cover with plastic wrap. Chill at least 1 hour.
Preheat broiler. Spread cut sides of rolls with butter. Broil rolls, buttered side up, until golden, about 2 minutes; cover.
Melt 2 tablespoons butter with oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Working in 2 batches, add burgers to skillet. Sauté until brown, about 5 minutes per side.
Arrange 1 roll half, cut side up, on each plate. Top each with lettuce leaf, then 2 crab burgers. Spoon dressing over.

Mix coarse salt, pepper, and allspice in bowl. Sprinkle spice mixture over roast. Let stand at room temperature 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 375°F. Heat oil in large wide ovenproof skillet over mediumhigh heat until nearly smoking. Add roast, fat side down, to skillet; cook until well browned on bottom, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn roast, fat side up, and transfer skillet to oven. Roast until instant-read thermometer inserted into center of meat registers 130°F for medium-rare, about 50 minutes. Transfer to platter; let rest while preparing sauce.
Pour off all but 2 tablespoons drippings from skillet and heat over medium-high heat. Add shallots to skillet and sauté until soft, about 3 minutes. Add Madeira; boil 1 minute. Add broth and boil until liquid is reduced by about 1/3, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes. Add any accumulated juices from meat to skillet; boil 1 minute longer. Turn off heat; add frozen butter and swirl skillet until butter is blended into sauce. Season sauce with salt and pepper.
Transfer sauce to small pitcher. Cut meat against grain into 1/3-to 1/2-inch slices and arrange on platter. Serve sauce alongside.
What to drink: A Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon. We like the blackberry and blueberry flavors and the subtle cocoa and spice of the 2005 Ladera ($39).

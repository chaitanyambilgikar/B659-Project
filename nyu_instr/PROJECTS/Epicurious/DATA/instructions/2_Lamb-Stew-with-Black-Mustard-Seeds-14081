Make seasoning paste: Wearing rubber gloves, seed and devein jalapeños and about half of cherry peppers or red chilies for a moderately hot dish. Cut gingerroot into 4 pieces. To a food processor with motor running add jalapeños, cherry peppers or red chilies, and remaining seasoning paste ingredients, 1 at a time through feed tube, and purée to a paste.
Heat a 5-quart heavy kettle over moderately low heat until hot. Add oil and heat until hot but not smoking. Cook seasoning paste, stirring frequently, until dry and very fragrant, about 25 minutes. Add lamb and cook over moderate heat, stirring, 10 minutes. Add water and simmer, partially covered, stirring occasionally, 45 minutes, or until lamb is tender.
Add vinegar, salt, and sugar and cook stew, uncovered, stirring, until sauce is thickened slightly, about 5 minutes.
Garnish stew with coriander and serve with rice, chutney, and squash.

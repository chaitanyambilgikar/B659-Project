Break cinnamon sticks into 1-inch pieces and finely grind in batches in an electric coffee/spice grinder with coriander, cumin, and cloves. Stir together with paprika and cayenne.
Stir together 1/4 cup oil and 1 tablespoon garlic in a large bowl and add 25 lamb chops, tossing to coat. Season with salt and toss with 1/4 cup spice mixture and 1 cup cilantro to coat. Transfer coated lamb to sealable plastic bags and coat remaining meat in same manner. Marinate, chilled, at least 2 hours.
Prepare grill.
Season lamb with salt and grill in batches on an oiled rack about 4 minutes on one side, then 2 minutes on the other for medium-rare. (Alternatively, broil lamb under a preheated broiler 2 to 3 inches from heat.) Serve lamb warm or at room temperature.

Stir in curry powder and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and cook, stirring frequently, 2 minutes.
Add lentils and water and simmer, covered, until lentils are tender, 25 to 40 minutes. Stir in lemon juice and season with salt and pepper.
Make cilantro oil: Purée cilantro, oil, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a blender.
Serve soup drizzled with cilantro oil.

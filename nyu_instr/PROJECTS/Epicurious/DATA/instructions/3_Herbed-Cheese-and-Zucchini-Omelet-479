Melt butter in heavy large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add zucchini and sauté until tender, about 3 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer zucchini to plate. Remove skillet from heat. Beat yolks and creamy herb cheese in small bowl to blend. Using clean dry beater, beat egg whites in medium bowl until soft peaks form. Fold yolk mixture into whites.
Place same skillet over medium-high heat. When butter sizzles, pour egg mixture into skillet. Sprinkle zucchini evenly over. Cook until omelet begins to set, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle cheddar cheese over. Using large spatula, fold omelet over, forming semicircle. Cover skillet; cook until omelet puffs and is cooked through, about 3 minutes. Slide omelet onto large plate.

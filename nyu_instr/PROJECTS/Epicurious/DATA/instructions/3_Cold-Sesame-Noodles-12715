In a blender blend together the peanut butter, 2 tablespoons of the sesame oil, the soy sauce, the water, the garlic, the gingerroot, the vinegar, the sugar, the chili paste, and a pinch of salt. In a kettle of salted boiling water cook the noodles until they are al dente, drain them in a colander, and rinse them well under cold water. Drain the noodles well, in a bowl toss them with the remaining 1/2 tablespoon sesame oil, and mound them on a platter. Drizzle the noodles with the sesame mixture and sprinkle them with the scallion.

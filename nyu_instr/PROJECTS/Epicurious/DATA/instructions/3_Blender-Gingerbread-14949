Preheat the oven to 350°F with the rack in the center position. Butter an 8-inch square pan and dust it with flour, shaking out the excess. Mix the milk and lemon juice together (the mixture will curdle). Sift the flour, baking soda, spices, and salt together in a small bowl and set aside.
Place the curdled milk, lemon zest, brown sugar, eggs, molasses, and butter in a blender, cover, and mix on medium speed until smooth. With the motor off, add the dry ingredients, then cover and blend on medium speed for 30 seconds. Scrape down the sides of the container and blend until smooth, another 30 seconds.
Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake until the top is dry and the cake has just started to pull away from the sides of the pan, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool the gingerbread in the pan before cutting into squares.

Preheat oven to 425° F. Melt butter and cool. Finely chop scallions. Into a bowl sift together cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Heat a dry well-seasoned 10-inch cast-iron skillet in middle of oven 10 minutes. Put shortening or bacon fat in skillet and heat 5 minutes. Swirl skillet to coat. While skillet is heating, make batter: Separate eggs. In a large bowl with an electric mixer beat yolks until pale and beat in butter and buttermilk. In a bowl with cleaned beaters beat whites until they just hold stiff peaks. Stir flour mixture into yolk mixture and fold in whites and scallions gently but thoroughly. Pour batter into hot skillet and, working quickly, spread evenly. Bake corn bread in middle of oven until a tester comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Corn bread may be made 4 hours ahead and kept, loosely covered, at room temperature.

Preheat oven to 400°F.
Sear the fish fillets in the sesame oil in a large, very hot skillet for 1 minute on each side. You should hear the fish sizzle. Remove fillets from the heat and transfer them to a glass baking dish or baking pan. Drizzle the soy sauce and the wine over them and bake them for 10 minutes. Remove them from the oven.
Meanwhile, heat the orange juice, zest, sherry and ginger together in a small saucepan over medium-high heat until reduced by half. Add the orange slices, and stir once or twice, until the sauce becomes thick. Remove from heat, drizzle the sauce over the fish, and serve.

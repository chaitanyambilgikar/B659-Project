In a bowl combine bulgur, 1 teaspoon salt, and water. Let bulgur soak, uncovered, until softened, 20 to 25 minutes.
While bulgur is soaking, in a dry small heavy skillet toast pecans over moderately low heat, shaking skillet frequently, until a shade darker, 4 to 5 minutes. Cool pecans and chop. Seed tomato and chop. Chop cucumber.
In a large bowl whisk together lemon juice, honey, spices, pepper, remaining â€š teaspoon salt, and oil until emulsified. Drain bulgur in a sieve and press out any excess water. Add bulgur, tomato, cucumber, pecans, and dill to dressing and toss well. Divide greens between 2 plates and top with bulgur.

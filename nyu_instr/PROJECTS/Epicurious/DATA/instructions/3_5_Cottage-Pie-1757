Cook potatoes in large saucepan of boiling salted water until tender. Drain. Return potatoes to same saucepan. Add 3 tablespoons butter and mash. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Preheat oven to 350°F. Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms and sauté until tender, about 7 minutes. Transfer mushrooms to bowl. Add beef, onion and garlic to same skillet and cook over medium-high heat until beef is brown, breaking up with spoon, about 8 minutes. Add flour and stir 2 minutes. Add mushrooms, gravy, parsley, carrot, Worcestershire and marjoram. Simmer 4 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Spoon beef mixture into 8-inch square baking dish. Spoon mashed potatoes over; smooth top. Bake until potatoes are heated through and golden brown, about 25 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes before serving.

Preheat oven to 500°F.
Season cod with salt and pepper. In a large shallow baking pan toss zucchini, tomatoes, onions, bell pepper, garlic, and thyme with oil and salt and pepper to taste and spread in one layer. Roast vegetables in middle of oven 20 minutes, or until they begin to brown. Arrange fish over vegetables and roast 7 minutes, or until it just flakes with a fork.
While vegetables and fish are roasting, in a small skillet toast bread crumbs with parsley and salt and pepper to taste over moderate heat, stirring, until golden, about 5 minutes.
Transfer fish carefully to a plate and keep warm, covered. To vegetables add water, soy sauce, lemon juice, and Worcestershire sauce and stir to loosen brown bits from bottom of pan and break up tomatoes. Divide ragout among 4 plates and top with fish and bread crumbs.

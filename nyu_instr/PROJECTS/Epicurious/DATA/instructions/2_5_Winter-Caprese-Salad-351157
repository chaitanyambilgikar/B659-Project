Preheat oven to 400°F with rack in middle.
Toss tomatoes with 2 tablespoons oil and 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and pepper. Roast tomatoes, cut sides up, in 1 layer in a 4-sided sheet pan until skins are wrinkled and beginning to brown on bottom, about 45 minutes. Cool completely.
Cut basil into very fine shreds. Arrange mozzarella and tomatoes on plates and sprinkle with basil. Drizzle with vinegar and remaining oil. Season with pepper.

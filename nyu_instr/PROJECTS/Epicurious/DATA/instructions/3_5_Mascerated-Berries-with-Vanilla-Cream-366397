For berries: Using a potato masher or the back of a wooden spoon, mash 1 cup berries with sugar and orange juice in a large bowl until sugar begins to dissolve. Gently stir in remaining 5 cups berries; let sit at room temperature, tossing occasionally, until berries are juicy, 1–2 hours.
For vanilla cream: Scrape seeds from vanilla bean into a medium bowl. Add chilled cream, sour cream, and sugar. Using a whisk or electric mixer, beat until soft peaks form. DO AHEAD: Cream can be made 30 minutes ahead. Cover and chill.

In a small saucepan combine 1 cup of the grapefruit juice, the sugar, and the ginger and boil the mixture, stirring, until the sugar is dissolved. Remove the pan from the heat and let the mixture cool completely. Pour the mixture through a fine sieve into a bowl or large glass measure, stir in the remaining 2 cups grapefruit juice and the bitters, and chill the mixture, covered, until it is cold. Freeze the mixture in an ice-cream freezer according to the manufacturer's instructions.

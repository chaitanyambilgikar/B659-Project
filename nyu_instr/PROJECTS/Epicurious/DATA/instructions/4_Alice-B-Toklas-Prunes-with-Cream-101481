Soak prunes for 24 hours in 2 cups port. Then add 2 more cups port, the sugar, and vanilla bean. Cook gently for about 1/2 hour. Cool and refrigerate for 3 days.
To serve, put in a decorative bowl and cover with whipped cream. Sprinkle whipped cream with a thick layer of powdered macaroons and garnish with candied violets.

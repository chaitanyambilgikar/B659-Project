Spread the zucchini in a microwave-safe dish. In a small bowl toss the jalapeño Monterey Jack with the flour, sprinkle the mixture over the zucchini mixture on high power (100%), uncovered, for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the zucchini is tender and the cheese is melted. Season the zucchini mixture with salt and pepper.

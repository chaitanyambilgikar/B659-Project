Trim and coarsely chop 10 oz fresh spinach.
Finely chop onions and garlic cloves, then sauté in the olive oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat, stirring, until golden, about 10 minutes. Stir in oregano, salt, pepper, and mushrooms and sauté, stirring, until mushrooms are golden and any liquid is evaporated, about 5 minutes. Add ground beef chuck and sauté, breaking up lumps, until browned, 3 to 5 minutes.
Add spinach and cook, stirring, until wilted, about 2 minutes. Beat eggs with a fork and add to skillet, then cook, stirring, until just set, about 2 minutes.

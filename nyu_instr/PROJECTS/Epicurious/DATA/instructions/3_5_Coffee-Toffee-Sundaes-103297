Stir 2 tablespoons water and espresso powder in small bowl until espresso powder dissolves. Combine remaining 1/3 cup water and sugar in heavy medium saucepan. Stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat and boil without stirring until syrup turns deep amber color, occasionally brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush and swirling pan, about 8 minutes. Remove from heat. Add cream and espresso mixture (mixture will bubble vigorously). Return to medium heat and stir until any caramel bits dissolve, about 2 minutes. Cool sauce until slightly thickened, about 15 minutes. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Rewarm over low heat until just warmed through.) Divide ice cream among bowls. Top with sauce and toffee, dividing equally.

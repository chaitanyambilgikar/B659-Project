Place sorghum syrup in a medium saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Add orange zest, thyme sprigs, and pinch of salt. Simmer sorghum mixture for 1 minute. Add figs. Continue to simmer, gently stirring occasionally, until figs are soft but still hold their shape, 5–10 minutes, depending on firmness of figs. Let jam cool. DO AHEAD: Jam can be made 2 weeks ahead. Transfer to a jar. Cover and chill.

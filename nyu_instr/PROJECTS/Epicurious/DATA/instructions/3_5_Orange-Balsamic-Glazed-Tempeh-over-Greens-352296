Combine orange juice concentrate, vinegar, oil, soy sauce, garlic, basil and parsley in a skillet over medium heat. When the mixture is hot, arrange tempeh slices in the mixture and cook until browned, about 4 minutes. Turn and brown on the other side, about 4 minutes more.
While the tempeh braises, place about 1/2-inch water and a pinch of salt in the bottom of a saucepan and bring to a boil. Add greens and steam until they are just wilted and bright green, about 3 minutes. Drain well and slice into bite-size pieces. Arrange greens on a platter. Arrange tempeh slices on top of greens and sprinkle with lemon juice. Serve hot.

Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 400°F.
Melt butter in a saucepan and stir in wine, Worcestershire sauce, chipotles with adobo sauce (to taste), garlic, and salt. Toss shrimp with sauce in baking dish and bake until shrimp are just cooked through, 10 to 12 minutes. Sauce can be briefly simmered (with shrimp removed) to reduce it as needed.

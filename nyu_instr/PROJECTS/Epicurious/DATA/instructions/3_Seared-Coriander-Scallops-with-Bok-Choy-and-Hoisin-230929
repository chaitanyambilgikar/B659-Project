Whisk orange juice, hoisin sauce, and ginger in small bowl. Pat scallops dry on paper towels. Sprinkle coriander seeds over top of scallops, pressing to adhere. Heat sesame oil in large nonstick skillet over high heat. Add scallops, coriander side down, and cook just until opaque in center, turning once, about 1 1/2 minutes per side. Transfer scallops to plate. Add bok choy and 2 tablespoons water to skillet; sauté until wilted, about 2 minutes. Using tongs, divide bok choy between 2 plates, then top with scallops. Add hoisin mixture to same skillet; boil until reduced to 1/3 cup, about 2 minutes. Drizzle sauce over scallops and bok choy.
*Hoisin sauce, a thick mixture of ground soybeans, garlic, chiles, and spices, is used as a condiment and ingredient in Chinese cooking. It can be found in the Asian foods section of many supermarkets and at Asian markets.

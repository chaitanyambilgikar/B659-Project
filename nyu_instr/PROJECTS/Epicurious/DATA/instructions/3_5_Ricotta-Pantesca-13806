Mix salt in water until dissolved. Heat the milk and the "seawater" over low heat until the mixture boils. Add the lemon juice, stir a few times, and when mixture begins to curdle remove from the heat. Let curds rest for a minute or two. Skim the ricotta curds from the whey with a slotted spoon or skimmer and place them in a colander lined with cheesecloth, a wire sieve, or a plastic ricotta basket. Drain for 15 minutes. Serve warm, or at room temperature, with a drizzle of honey. Yield: around 1/2 pound ricotta pantesca.

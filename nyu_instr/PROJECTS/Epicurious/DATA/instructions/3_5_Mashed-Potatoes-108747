Peel potatoes and cut into 2-inch pieces. Cover potatoes with salted cold water by 1 inch in a 5-quart pot, then simmer, uncovered, until tender, about 18 minutes.
Shortly before potatoes are done, bring milk just to a simmer in a small saucepan over moderate heat, then remove from heat.
Drain potatoes well in a colander, then return to pot along with hot milk, butter, salt, and pepper and mash with a potato masher until combined well.
Variations: • Add 2 cups crumbled goat cheese (8 oz) to potatoes along with butter and milk, and reduce salt to 3/4 teaspoon.
• In place of butter, use 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil.
• In place of milk, use 1 1/2 cups heavy cream and 1/2 cup drained bottled horseradish.
• In place of 1 cup of milk, use 1 cup sour cream at room temperature.
• Add roasted garlic: Roast 2 heads of garlic, wrapped in foil, in a preheated 400°F oven 50 minutes. Squeeze roasted garlic from skins into potatoes along with butter and milk.

Cut off the bottom and top of each berry (you should have about 1 1/4 cups). Slice the centers of the berries and set aside. Push the berry tops and bottoms and the jam through a food mill or process in a mini food processor until pureed. Mix the sliced berries into the puree. Cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until ready to serve.
At serving time, put the cookies in a plastic bag and crush them coarsely with a rolling pin. Divide the crumbs among four bowls or goblets. Spoon about half of the berry mixture on top of the cookies. Stir the crème fraîche or sour cream to loosen it and spoon on top of the berries. Top with the remaining berry mixture. Garnish each dessert with a mint sprig, and, if you like, pass some crème fraîche or sour cream.

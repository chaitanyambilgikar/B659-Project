Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 450°F. Generously butter a large (13- by 9- by 2-inch) shallow baking pan.
Heat zest, juice, molasses, salt, and pepper in a small saucepan over moderate heat, stirring, until molasses is dissolved.
Toss potatoes with molasses mixture in baking pan and arrange, cut sides down, in 1 layer. Bake, uncovered, turning over once (to other cut side), until tender and glazed, 25 to 30 minutes.

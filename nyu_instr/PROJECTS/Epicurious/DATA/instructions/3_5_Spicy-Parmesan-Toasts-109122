Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 375°F.
Arrange baguette slices in 1 layer on a baking sheet. Brush 1 side of each slice with oil and sprinkle with salt. Bake 10 minutes. Toss cheese with cayenne and sprinkle over each slice. Bake until cheese is melted and toasts are golden and crisp, 6 to 8 minutes more. Cool completely.

1. Combine the flour, Creole seasoning, and salt in a wide bowl. Rinse the trout fillets and pat dry. Dredge the fish in the seasoned flour and knock off the excess.
2. Make a medium-brown roux by melting the butter in a saucepan over medium heat. When it begins to bubble, add the remaining seasoned flour and cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture turns a medium brown.
3. Put the stock into another saucepan and place over medium-high heat. Whisk the roux into the stock until dissolved. Add the lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, and vinegar, and simmer for 3 minutes, then remove the pan from the heat. Keep the sauce warm while you prepare the fish.
4. You can sauté the fish in butter if you like, but it's more common in New Orleans to fry it in abut an inch of oil heated to 375 degrees. Either way, cook until golden brown (about 2 minutes per side).
5. Spoon the sauce over the fish and serve with lemon wedges.

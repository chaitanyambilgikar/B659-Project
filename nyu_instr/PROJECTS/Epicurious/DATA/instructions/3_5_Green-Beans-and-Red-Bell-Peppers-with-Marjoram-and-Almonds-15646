Cook green beans in large pot of boiling salted water until just crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Drain. Rinse with cold water. Drain well; set aside. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add peppers and onion and sauté until peppers are crisp-tender, about 8 minutes. Mix in marjoram. (Beans and bell pepper mixture can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover separately and refrigerate.)
Melt remaining 3 tablespoons butter in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add beans and pepper mixture and stir until heated through, about 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer to large bowl. Sprinkle with almonds.

Preheat oven to 400° F. and lightly coat twelve 1/4-cup muffin tins with cooking spray.
In a large bowl stir together flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon.
In a small bowl whisk together egg whites, sugar, applesauce, and vanilla until combined well and add to flour mixture, stirring until just combined. Stir in chocolate chips and chopped pecans until just combined. Divide batter among muffin tins and bake in middle of oven 15 minutes, or until a tester inserted in centers comes out clean.
Cool muffins in tins on a rack 5 minutes and invert onto rack to cool completely.

Put oven rack in upper third of oven and preheat oven to 400°F.
Stir together tomatoes, brown sugar, mustard, and salt in a bowl. Gently stir in beans and transfer to a 2-quart shallow baking dish.
Arrange onion slices in 1 layer over beans, then cover onion with bacon.
Bake, uncovered, until bacon is browned and beans have absorbed most of liquid, about 1 1/4 hours.

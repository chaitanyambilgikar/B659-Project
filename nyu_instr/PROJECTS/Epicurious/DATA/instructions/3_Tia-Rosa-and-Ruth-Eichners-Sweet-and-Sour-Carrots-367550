1. Boil the whole carrots until tender, then cut into 1/2-inch rounds. Steam the bell peppers and onions until tender. Combine all the vegetables in a large crock or bowl.
2. Combine the vinegar and the sugar in a saucepan over low heat. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Stir in the tomato puree, mustard, and Worcestershire. Remove from the heat. Pour over the vegetables and stir together well. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Cover and chill for at least 2 hours before serving.

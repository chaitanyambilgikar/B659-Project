Whisk 1/4 cup plain yogurt and 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a medium bowl. Stir in 1/4 cup each chopped fresh cilantro and fresh mint, 1 teaspoon kosher salt, 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, and 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper. Fold in 1/2 pound lump crabmeat (picked over) and 1/2 cup finely diced mango. Thinly spread yogurt on one side of each of 16 toasted 1/4"-thick slices Pullman or white sandwich bread. Divide crab mixture among 8 slices; top with remaining bread, yogurt side down. Trim crusts. Cut each sandwich in half on a diagonal. Place 2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds on a plate, if desired. Dip one cut side of each sandwich in sesame seeds.

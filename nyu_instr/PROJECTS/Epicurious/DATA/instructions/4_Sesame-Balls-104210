Dissolve the brown candy in 1 cup of boiling water and set aside to cool overnight.
Place the rice flour in a large bowl. Make a well and add candy water all at once. Stir until the water is incorporated; the dough will be smooth but slightly sticky.
Dust hands lightly with rice flour and roll dough into a thick rope. Cut the rope into 24 equal pieces, roll each piece into a ball and flatten to make a 2 1/2-inch round.
Using the thumbs and index fingers from both hands, pleat the edge of the dough to form a cup. Place one index finger into the cup and gently press the dough into the opposite palm on all sides of the cup to create a smooth, even surface and to make the dough even thinner.
Add a scant 1 teaspoon of the red bean paste mixture. Gently pack the filling down. Gather the edges of the dough over the filling and, again, pleat until the hole is about 1/2 inch in diameter. Squeeze together the dough, pressing to seal the dough securely. Roll between palms to form a ball. Continue filling the remainder of the dough. Place a sheet of waxed paper on the counter and sprinkle with the sesame seeds. Roll and press the outside of each ball in the sesame seeds.
In a 8-inch wide, 5-inch deep pot, heat vegetable oil over medium-high heat until hot but not smoking, about 330 degrees on a deep-fat thermometer. Carefully add 6 sesame balls at a time, and cook over medium heat until golden, 6 to 7 minutes. As the balls float to the surface, begin to press them gently with the back of a metal spatula against the sides of the pot. The balls will expand as they are gently rotated and pressed. Increase the heat to medium-high and fry until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Place on a plate lined with several thicknesses of paper towels. Repeat with remaining sesame balls. Set aside oil to cool before discarding. Serve immediately.

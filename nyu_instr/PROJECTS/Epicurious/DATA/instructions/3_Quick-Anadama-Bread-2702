Preheat oven to 350°F. Grease 9x5-inch glass loaf pan. Mix all purpose flour, whole wheat flour, yellow cornmeal, baking powder, salt and baking soda in large bowl. Combine buttermilk, dark molasses, butter and egg in another bowl and mix to blend. Add to dry ingredients and stir until just blended. Spoon into prepared loaf pan. Sprinkle with poppy seeds. Bake until loaf is springy to touch, about 1 hour. Cool in pan on rack 10 minutes. Turn out onto rack. Cool bread to room temperature. Cut into slices and serve.

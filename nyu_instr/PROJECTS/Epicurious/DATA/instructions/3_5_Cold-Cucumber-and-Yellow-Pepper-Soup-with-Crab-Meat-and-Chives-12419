Make Soup: In a blender purée soup ingredients with salt and pepper to taste until smooth. Force soup through a fine sieve into a bowl and chill, covered, 4 hours, or until very cold. Soup may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.
Just before serving, in a small bowl toss crab with oil, vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste.
Divide crab mixture among 6 soup bowls, mounding it in center, and ladle soup around it. Sprinkle each serving with finely chopped chives and garnish with diced yellow pepper and chive pieces.

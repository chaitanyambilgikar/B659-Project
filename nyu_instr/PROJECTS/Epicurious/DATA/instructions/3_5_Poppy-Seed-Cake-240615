Preheat oven to 325°F with rack in middle. Butter and flour springform pan.
Grind poppy seeds in small batches in grinder until they have a fluffy, sandy texture.
Beat together butter and granulated sugar with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add yolks 1 at a time, beating well after each addition, then beat in ground poppy seeds, cinnamon, nutmeg, raisins, and zest until just combined.
Using cleaned beaters, beat egg whites with salt in another bowl until they just hold stiff peaks. Stir one third of whites into batter to lighten, then fold in remaining whites gently but thoroughly.
Pour batter into springform pan and bake until a wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean, 1 to 1 1/4 hours.
Cool in pan on a rack 10 minutes. Remove side of pan and cool cake completely.
Just before serving, dust cake with confectioners sugar.

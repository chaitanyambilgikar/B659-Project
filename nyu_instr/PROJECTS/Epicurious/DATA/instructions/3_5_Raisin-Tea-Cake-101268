The day before baking, make the mixed spice: In a spice grinder, combine the coriander seeds, cinnamon, cloves, and allspice. Grind until powdery. Pour into an airtight container. Add nutmeg and ginger and mix well. Measure out 1 level tablespoon and store the remainder in a cool place for later use.
Combine the mixed spice with the water, raisins, butter, and sugar in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool completely. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
The next day, let the raisin mixture sit at room temperature for 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Generously grease a 9-inch round cake pan.
Sift the flour, baking soda, and salt together into a large bowl. Stir in the raisin mixture and blend well. Stir in the egg. Pour into the prepared pan. Place on the center rack of the oven with a pan of water. Bake until the cake is lightly browned and a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 1/4 hours.

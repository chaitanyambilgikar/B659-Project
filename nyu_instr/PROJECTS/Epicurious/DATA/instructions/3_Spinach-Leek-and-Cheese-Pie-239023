1. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add the onion and a pinch of salt. Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, 6 minutes. Add the leek, season with more salt and the pepper, and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are very soft and translucent, about 8 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and set in an ice bath to cool.
2. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 325°F.
3. Generously coat an 8-inch round nonstick springform pan with butter and chill.
4. Sift together the flour and baking powder in a medium bowl; set aside.
5. Combine the yogurt, feta, onion-and-leek mixture, spinach, and dill in a large bowl. Add the eggs and stir to combine. Using a rubber spatula, gently stir in the flour mixture and season with more salt and pepper. Pour into the prepared pan, gently tapping the sides to level the top.
6. Bake for 30 minutes. Increase heat to 425°F and bake until golden brown and set in the center, about 10 minutes more.
7. Transfer to a wire rack and cool for 10 minutes before unmolding.

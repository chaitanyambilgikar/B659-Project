1. Puree the corn and cream; transfer to a bowl. Stir in cornmeal, flour, baking powder, salt, and pepper; mix in eggs and butter to make a batter.
2. Place oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add batter to the skillet in heaping tablespoons. Cook until corn cakes are golden brown, about 1 minute per side. Drain on paper towels. Continue, adding more oil to the skillet as necessary. (Batter makes about 30 cakes.)
3. To serve, arrange 3 corn cakes on each of 8 plates. Top each with 1 teaspoon of crème fraîche and a small dollop of caviar.

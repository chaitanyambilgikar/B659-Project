Preheat oven to 400°F. Place 2 onions cut side down on baking sheet. Pour 2 tablespoons oil over. Sprinkle with sugar. Bake onions 30 minutes; turn onions over and bake until brown and caramelized, about 30 minutes longer. Cool. Transfer onions to processor. Add remaining 1 cup oil, broth and vinegar and puree (mixture will be thick). Season with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
Combine greens, 1/2 cup walnuts and half of red onion in large bowl. Add enough dressing to coat greens; toss well. Sprinkle remaining walnuts and red onion over and serve.

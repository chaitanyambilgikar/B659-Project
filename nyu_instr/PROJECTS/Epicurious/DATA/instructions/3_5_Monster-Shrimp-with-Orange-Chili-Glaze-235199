1. Put the orange juice, cilantro, chili paste, olive oil, garlic, scallion, chipotle, and salt in a blender or food processor fitted with the metal blade and blend until smooth.
2. Place the shrimp in a resealable freezer bag and pour the orange juice mixture over the shrimp. Chill in a refrigerator or ice-filled cooler for 2 to 3 hours but no longer.
3. Remove the shrimp from the marinade and discard the marinade.
4. Grill the shrimp over medium-high heat until they are opaque in the centers, 3 to 4 minutes per side.
5. Remove from heat and serve immediately — though they still rock at room temperature.

In a mixing bowl, beat the eggs and add a dash of salt and pepper. In another bowl, soak the matzoh in warm water for about 30 seconds. Remove and set aside. In a large skillet over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the matzoh to the egg mixture, tossing gently to coat (making sure not to break up the matzoh too much), and add this to the hot skillet. Allow the matzoh to cook undisturbed for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the bottom begins to brown. Turn it over, stirring gently to cook through and allow the other side to brown (the matzoh will begin to break up at this point, which is fine). Add salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately.

Preheat oven to 350°F. Generously butter 8x8x2-inch glass baking dish. Bring broth, 2 tablespoons butter, and garlic to boil in heavy medium saucepan. Gradually whisk in grits and return mixture to boil, whisking occasionally. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until grits are thick and almost all broth is absorbed, whisking frequently, about 8 minutes. Whisk in 1/2 cup cream and simmer 5 minutes, whisking occasionally. Whisk in remaining 1/4 cup cream and simmer until very thick, stirring often, about 5 minutes longer. Stir in tomatoes and thyme. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Pour into prepared dish. Sprinkle goat cheese over. Bake until cheese softens, about 15 minutes. Garnish with chives, if desired, and serve immediately.

Cook unpeeled potatoes in large pot of boiling salted water until partially cooked, about 10 minutes. Cool 10 minutes. Slice potatoes into 1/2-inch-thick rounds. (Can be made 3 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.)
Bring broth and saffron to simmer in large skillet over medium heat. Add butter. Reduce heat to low; add potatoes and simmer uncovered until tender and liquid is absorbed, turning potatoes once, 50 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.

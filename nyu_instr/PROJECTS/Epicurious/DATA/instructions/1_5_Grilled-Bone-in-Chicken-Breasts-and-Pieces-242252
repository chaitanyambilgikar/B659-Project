Grilling Method: Indirect/Medium Heat
Remove and discard excess fat from chicken. Pat dry. Brush lightly with oil. Season with salt and pepper. Place chicken, bone-side down, in center of cooking grate. You do not need to turn the chicken pieces.
Grill-roast until breast meat near bone registers 165°F and thigh meat registers 180°F. If you don't have a meat thermometer, cook until the chicken meat is no longer pink and the juices run clear. Remove and let sit 5 to 10 minutes before serving.

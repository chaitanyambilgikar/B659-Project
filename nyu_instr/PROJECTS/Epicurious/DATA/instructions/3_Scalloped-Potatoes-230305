Preheat oven to 375°F. Coat an 8" square pan with cooking spray. Combine 2 cups milk, almonds, pepper, garlic, salt, and nutmeg in blender and process until smooth. Pour into a medium saucepan and heat to low boil. In a small bowl, combine remaining 2 tbsp milk and cornstarch; whisk slowly into boiling sauce and stir until thickened, about 2 minutes. Place potato slices in large bowl and toss with sauce. Layer potatoes in baking pan and cover evenly with remaining sauce. Bake 15 to 20 minutes or until potatoes are soft. Cool 5 minutes before serving.

Prepare grill.
In a large bowl toss vegetables with 1/4 cup oil, pepper, and salt to taste. Grill vegetables in batches on a rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals, turning them, 5 to 10 minutes for just-tender bell peppers and 10 to 15 minutes for just-tender squash and eggplant. Transfer vegetables to a platter to cool completely. Vegetables may be grilled 1 day ahead and chilled, covered. Bring vegetables to room temperature before serving or heat on a baking sheet in a preheated 350° F. oven until just heated through. Brush vegetables with additional oil.

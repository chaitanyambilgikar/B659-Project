Fill a deep 10- to 12-inch heavy skillet (preferably cast-iron) halfway with oil and heat over moderate heat until it registers 360°F on thermometer.
Put flour in a shallow bowl, then fill another bowl halfway with cold water. Cut zucchini into paper-thin rounds with slicer, then separate slices. Put 12 slices in 1 sieve and dip into water, shaking off excess. Transfer slices to flour and dredge, then gently shake in second sieve to remove excess flour.
Fry coated slices in oil, turning and separating, until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer zucchini chips with a wire-mesh or slotted spoon to paper towels to drain, then season lightly with salt. Coat and fry remaining slices in same manner. Serve warm.

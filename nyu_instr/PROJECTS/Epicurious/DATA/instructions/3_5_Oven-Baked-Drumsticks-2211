Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter 2 large baking sheets. Combine breadcrumbs, Parmesan cheese, parsley, onion powder, paprika, oregano, salt and pepper in large bowl and stir to blend. Melt butter in small saucepan over medium-low-heat. Remove saucepan from heat. Add mustard and whisk to blend. Brush drumsticks generously with butter mixture, then roll in breadcrumb mixture coating completely. Arrange drumsticks on prepared baking sheets.
Bake drumsticks until golden brown and cooked through, about 1 hour. Serve warm or at room temperature.

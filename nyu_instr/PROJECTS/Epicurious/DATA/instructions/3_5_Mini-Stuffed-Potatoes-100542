Preheat oven to 400°F. Cut potatoes in half crosswise. Mix with oil in bowl. Place cut side down on a baking sheet. Bake potatoes until just tender, about 25 minutes, and cool completely.
In a medium bowl, combine the sour cream, 4 tablespoons scallion or chives, and bacon. Add pepper to taste. Cut a thin slice off rounded end of each potato so that it will sit upright. Turn the potatoes over and, using melon baller or small spoon, scoop out some of the center of each potato (reserve for later use in potato pancakes or gnocchi). Fill with 1 tablespoon of the sour cream mixture, and garnish with the remaining scallion or chives. Serve immediately or cover and chill until needed.

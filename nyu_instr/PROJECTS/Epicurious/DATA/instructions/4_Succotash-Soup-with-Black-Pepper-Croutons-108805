For croutons: Melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add bread and pepper and stir to coat. Sauté until croutons are golden and crisp on all sides, stirring occasionally, about 12 minutes. Sprinkle with salt. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cool completely; store airtight at room temperature.)
For soup: Melt butter in heavy large pot over medium heat. Add leeks, shallots, and garlic; sauté until leeks are soft, about 5 minutes. Add 4 tablespoons parsley, thyme, and oregano; sauté until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Mix in red bell pepper. Add broth and lima beans and bring soup to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until lima beans are tender, about 10 minutes. Add creamed corn and corn kernels and heat through. Remove soup from heat; season to taste with salt. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Refrigerate uncovered until cold, then cover and keep refrigerated. Bring to simmer before continuing.)
Ladle soup into bowls. Top each with some croutons and some of remaining 2 tablespoons parsley. Serve, passing remaining croutons separately.

Gently rinse and dry zucchini blossoms.
Place each chicken breast between two 12-inch squares of parchment paper; using mallet, pound chicken to 1/4- to 1/3-inch thickness. Remove chicken from parchment paper and cut each breast in half lengthwise.
Season chicken with salt and pepper; top each with 3 zucchini blossoms. Wrap each chicken breast with 2 prosciutto slices, using toothpick to secure prosciutto and blossoms.
Melt butter with olive oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken, blossom side down, and sauté until browned, about 3 minutes per side. Add white wine and continue cooking until wine is reduced and thickens slightly, about 2 minutes longer. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer chicken to serving platter. Remove toothpicks and pour sauce over chicken.

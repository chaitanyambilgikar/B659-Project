Whisk first 6 ingredients in small bowl to blend. Season dressing to taste with salt and pepper.
Transfer half of dressing to large bowl. Mix in shrimp and bell peppers; let marinate 15 minutes.
Cook broccoli stems and florets in large pot of boiling salted water until crisp-tender, about 2 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer broccoli to sieve and drain. Cook pasta in same pot of boiling water until just tender but still firm to bite. Drain; rinse with cold water until cool and drain again.
Add broccoli, pasta and green onions to shrimp mixture. Toss with enough additional dressing to coat. Serve at room temperature, or cover and refrigerate up to 6 hours and serve cold.

Soak onion in 1 cup cold water with 1/2 teaspoon salt 15 minutes (to make onion flavor milder). Drain in a sieve, then rinse under cold water and pat dry.
Whisk together lime juice, oil, sugar, pepper, and remaining 3/4 teaspoon salt in a large bowl until combined well. Add onion, jicama, cilantro, and salt to taste and toss well.

Finely grate enough zest from lemons to measure 2 teaspoons and squeeze enough juice to measure 1/2 cup. In a metal bowl whisk together zest, juice, sugar, and eggs. Cut butter into 4 pieces and add to mixture. Set bowl over a saucepan of simmering water and cook mixture, whisking occasionally, until thickened and smooth, about 20 minutes. Lemon curd may be kept, chilled and its surface covered with plastic wrap, 3 days. Serve lemon curd warm or chilled.

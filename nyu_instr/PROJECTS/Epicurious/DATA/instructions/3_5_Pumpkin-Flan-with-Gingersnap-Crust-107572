To prepare the flan, bring a saucepan of water to a boil. Add the calabaza and cook until tender, about 30 minutes. Drain the calabaza and let cool. Transfer to a food processor, add the condensed and evaporated milk, eggs, and the 3 tablespoons of sugar and purée until smooth. Set aside.
Preheat the oven to 375°F.
To make the caramel, place the cup of sugar in a heavy-bottomed saucepan and cook, stirring constantly, over medium heat until the sugar is a light amber color, about 20 minutes. Pour the caramel into a 9 by 4-inch loaf pan or into 6 individual 8-ounce ramekins or molds. Pour the reserved flan mixture on top of the caramel and place in a water bath. Bake for 15 minutes.
Reduce the oven temperature to 350°F, and bake until set (a knife inserted will come out clean), about 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool completely.
To prepare the crust, place the cookies and butter in a food processor and process until well blended. Pack the crust mixture on top of the cooled flan, and transfer to the refrigerator to chill overnight.
To serve, run a knife around the inside edges of the loaf pan or molds and invert onto a serving platter or individual plates.

Heat 1 tablespoon corn oil in heavy medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add roasted peppers, onion, celery, carrot and garlic and sauté until onions are translucent, about 10 minutes. Add 1 cup beef stock and 1/2 cup apple juice and simmer uncovered over medium heat 15 minutes. Add whipping cream and chipotle chilies and simmer 5 minutes longer. Transfer sauce to blender. Puree until smooth. Strain sauce. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Thin sauce with more stock and apple juice if necessary. (Sauce can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Rewarm sauce over low heat before using.)

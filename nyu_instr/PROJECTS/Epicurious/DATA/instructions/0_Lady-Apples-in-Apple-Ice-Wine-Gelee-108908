Remove 2 (4- by 1-inch) strips of zest from lemon with a vegetable peeler, then halve lemon crosswise.
Peel top 1/2 inch of each apple, leaving stem and rest of skin intact. Rub cut side of a lemon half over peeled part of apples. Arrange apples, stem ends up, in 1 layer in a 12-inch heavy skillet. Add zest and ice wine to skillet, then sprinkle sugar over apples. Bring to a simmer over moderate heat, swirling skillet occasionally, then reduce heat to low and cover skillet. Poach until apples are tender but still hold their shape, 20 to 50 minutes. Check apples frequently after 20 minutes and transfer as cooked to a bowl.
Discard zest and spoon cooking liquid over apples. Chill, covered, until cold, at least 3 hours (liquid will gel slightly). Bring to room temperature just before serving.

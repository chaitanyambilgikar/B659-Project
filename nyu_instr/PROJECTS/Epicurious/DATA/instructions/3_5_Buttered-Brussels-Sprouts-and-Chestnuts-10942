In a steamer set over boiling water steam the Brussels sprouts, covered, for 7 to 8 minutes, or until they are just tender. In a skillet heat the butter over moderately high heat until it begins to color and in it sauté the chestnuts for 1 minute. Add the sprouts, season the mixture with salt and pepper, and sauté it for 1 minute.

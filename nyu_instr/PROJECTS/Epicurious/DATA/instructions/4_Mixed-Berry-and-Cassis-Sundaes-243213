Bring crème de cassis and 1/4 cup sugar to a simmer, stirring until sugar has dissolved (if alcohol flames, momentarily cover with lid to extinguish). Stir in lemon juice.
Pour syrup over berries, stirring gently to coat. Let stand 10 minutes.
Beat cream with remaining tablespoon sugar using an electric mixer until it just holds stiff peaks.
Divide ice cream and sorbet among glasses. Top with berries and syrup, then with whipped cream.

Prepare grill.
In a metal measure heat oil over low heat until warm. (Heating thins oil, making it easier to thinly coat zucchini.) In a bowl drizzle oil over zucchini, tossing to coat, and season with salt and pepper. Grill zucchini, in batches if necessary, on a lightly oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals 2 to 4 minutes on each side, or until lightly charred and just tender.
Serve zucchini warm or at room temperature.

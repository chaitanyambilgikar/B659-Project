Preheat oven to 375°F.
Whisk together cornstarch and 2 tablespoons butter in a small bowl until smooth, then whisk in salt, remaining 4 tablespoons butter, and sesame seeds.
Brush rough sides of pita halves with butter mixture, stirring mixture well before brushing each half. Cut each pita half into 8 wedges and arrange, seeded sides up, in 1 layer on 2 baking sheets. Bake in upper and lower thirds of oven, switching position of sheets halfway through baking, until golden, 10 to 12 minutes total. Cool toasts on a rack.

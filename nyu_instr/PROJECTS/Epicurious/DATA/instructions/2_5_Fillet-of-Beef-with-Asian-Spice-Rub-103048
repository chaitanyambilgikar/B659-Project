Preheat oven to 425°F.
Toast peppercorns and anise seeds in a dry large heavy skillet over moderate heat, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Finely grind toasted mixture in an electric coffee/spice grinder or with a mortar and pestle. Sift mixture through a coarse sieve into a bowl and stir in salt, five-spice powder, and ginger.
Halve beef crosswise and sprinkle rub all over both pieces, pressing to adhere.
Heat 2 tablespoons oil in skillet over moderately high heat until just smoking, then brown 1 piece of beef on all sides, about 1 minute. Transfer to a large roasting pan. Wipe skillet clean with paper towels and brown remaining beef in same manner. Arrange beef pieces 2 inches apart in roasting pan.
Roast in middle of oven 25 to 35 minutes, or until a thermometer inserted diagonally 2 inches into centers of pieces registers 120°F. Let beef stand in pan on a rack 25 minutes. Beef will continue to cook as it stands, reaching 130°F (medium-rare). Discard string and slice beef.
Serve at room temperature.

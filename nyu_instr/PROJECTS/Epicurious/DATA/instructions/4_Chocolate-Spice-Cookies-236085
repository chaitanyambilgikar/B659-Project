Set racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees.
Sift the dry ingredients into a bowl and set aside.
In another mixing bowl, beat the butter and sugar together with a large rubber spatula. Beat in the applesauce and molasses.
Stir in the dry ingredients to make a soft dough.
Drop tablespoons of the dough (or use a small ice cream scoop) an inch apart on the prepared pans.
Bake the cookies for about 10 minutes, changing the position of the pans about halfway through the baking. Exchange the top pan and the bottom and also turn them back to front at the same time. The cookies will still be fairly moist when they are done. Avoid overbaking them or they will be dry and hard.
Slide the papers from the pans to racks to cool the cookies.

Sprinkle lamb chops with salt and pepper. Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Working in 2 batches, sauté lamb chops until browned on both sides and cooked to medium-rare, about 2 1/2 minutes per side. Transfer to platter and tent with foil to keep warm.
Arrange 2 chops on each of 8 plates. Top each chop with rounded teaspoonful Béarnaise Butter and serve.

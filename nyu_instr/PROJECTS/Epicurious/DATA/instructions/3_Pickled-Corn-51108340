Cook corn in a large pot of lightly salted boiling water until crisp-tender, about 4 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a bowl of ice water. Let cool; drain.
Layer corn, garlic, chiles, and peppercorns in a 4-quart glass or ceramic jar.
Stir 5 1/2 tablespoons salt and 2 quarts water in a large bowl until salt is dissolved. Pour over corn mixture. Place several plates or small bowls over vegetables to keep them submerged by at least 2". Cover jar with plastic wrap or a lid and let stand in a dark, cool place such as a cellar, closet, or pantry at room temperature (68°F–70°F is ideal) for 4 days to pickle; taste corn. Want more pucker? Let it sit for 1–2 more days, then serve or refrigerate for up to 3 weeks.

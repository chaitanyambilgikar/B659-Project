Pickle vegetables: Bring water, vinegar, sugar, garlic, dill, bay leaf, spices, and 2 1/2 teaspoons salt to a boil in a small saucepan, stirring, then simmer 2 minutes.
Cut carrots, celery, and cucumber into 1 1/2-to 2-inch lengths, then julienne all vegetables, including radishes, with slicer. Transfer to a medium bowl, then pour warm pickling liquid over vegetables and let stand while you prepare and grill beef.
Prepare beef: Prepare grill for direct-heat cooking over hot charcoal (high heat for gas); see Grilling Procedure .
Combine garlic and oil in a small bowl.
Remove the string from meat if tied. To cut each steak into a long rectangle that is about 1/2 inch thick, stand it on its side on a cutting board, with a flat side facing you. Hold knife blade parallel to and 1/2 inch above cutting board and, with other hand holding top of meat, slice crosswise into meat (keeping blade 1/2 inch above board) just until you are 1/2 inch from cutting through. Rotate meat to left (or right, if left-handed) and continue to cut and rotate meat until it's unfurled and 1/2 inch thick.
Brush beef on both sides with garlic oil, then season both sides with 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper per filet. Oil grill rack, then grill beef, covered only if using a gas grill, turning once, 4 minutes total for medium-rare.
Drain pickled vegetables and discard dill, garlic, and bay leaf. Serve beef topped with vegetables.

Put egg yolks in glass heatproof bowl (or top of double boiler) and beat in the vinegar and cream. Season with salt and a little cayenne.
Stand bowl in pan of hot water (or top of double boiler over hot water) over a slow fire and beat with a small wire whisk until the mixture is as thick as heavy cream. It is important that the water should not boil; add cold water if it gets too hot.
Beat in the frozen butter, piece by piece, adding another piece only when the previous one has been absorbed. When all the butter is absorbed, add lemon juice. To hold, stand bowl in a pan of lukewarm water, cover top with foil.

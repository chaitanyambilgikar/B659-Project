Heat waffle iron. In a blender, process oats until flourlike in texture. In a bowl, combine oats with flour, flaxseed, baking powder, pumpkin pie spice and salt. In a second bowl, beat egg white until stiff peaks form. In a third bowl, mix milk, banana, oil and egg yolk. Gently stir milk-banana mixture into dry ingredients; gently fold in egg white until just combined. Coat waffle iron with cooking spray; pour 1/3 cup batter onto iron, and cook until waffle is crispy and pale gold, about 4 minutes. Repeat twice. Top each waffle with 1/4 cup yogurt, 1/2 cup strawberries, 1 tablespoon almonds and 2 teaspoon syrup.

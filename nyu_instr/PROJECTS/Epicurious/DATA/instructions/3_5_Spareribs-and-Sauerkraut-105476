Preheat the oven to 300°F. Choose a baking pan that will accommmodate the ribs in pieces or all hitched together, with the kraut in the space left over. Eight country-style ribs cut into a 6-rib and a 2-rib hunk, plus the can of kraut, fit perfectly in a 9-by-13-inch pan. For more ribs, get a bigger pan and more kraut.
Place the ribs in the pan and the sauerkraut in a mound beside them. Cover the ribs — not the kraut — with the barbecue sauce. Use as much as you like, maybe more than half the bottle, maybe less. Cover the pan tightly withaluminum foil and bake for 3 hours. Lift a corner of the foil near the end of the time to sneak a look. The ribs should be nicely browned and glazed and your mouth should water. Serve hot.

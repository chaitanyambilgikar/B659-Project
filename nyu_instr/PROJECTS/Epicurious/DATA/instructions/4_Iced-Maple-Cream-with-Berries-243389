Whisk constantly until candy thermometer registers 175°F, about 3 minutes. Remove bowl from over water. Using electric mixer, beat mixture until cool and thick, about 3 minutes.

Whisk jam in medium bowl to loosen. Add berries; toss to coat and let stand 15 minutes. Spoon berry mixture into dishes; top with maple cream.

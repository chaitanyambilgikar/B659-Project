Preheat oven to 350°F. Trim ends of onions to level. Place onions, flat side up, in small baking dish. Season onions with salt and pepper. Add wine to baking dish. Cover with foil and bake until onions are tender, basting with wine occasionally, about 55 minutes.
Meanwhile, melt butter in medium nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add breadcrumbs, parsley and thyme and sauté until breadcrumbs are light golden brown, about 4 minutes.
Remove onions from pan. Spoon breadcrumb mixture evenly onto onions. Press breadcrumbs lightly to adhere. Continue baking onions, uncovered, until breadcrumbs are crisp and golden brown, about 15 minutes. (Can be prepared 6 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature. Rewarm onions in 350°F. oven until topping is crisp, about 15 minutes.)

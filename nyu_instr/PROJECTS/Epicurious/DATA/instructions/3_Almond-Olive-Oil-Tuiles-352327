Preheat oven to 375°F with rack in middle. Line a large baking sheet with liner.
Whisk together all ingredients except sliced almonds until smooth.
Spoon 2 teaspoons of batter for each cookie, 2 inches apart, on baking sheet (about 6 cookies). Using an offset spatula or the back of a small spoon, spread each into a 3-inch round. Sprinkle about 1 teaspoon sliced almonds on each cookie.
Bake until pale golden, 7 to 9 minutes. Using a spatula, drape hot cookies over a rolling pin or empty wine bottle, pressing them gently to curl.
Make more cookies in same manner on cooled baking sheet.

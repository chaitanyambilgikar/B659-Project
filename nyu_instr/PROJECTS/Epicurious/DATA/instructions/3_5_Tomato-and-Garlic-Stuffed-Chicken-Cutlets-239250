Stir together garlic, anchovy paste, parsley, 1/2 tablespoon oil, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.
Pat chicken dry, then spread with parsley mixture. Fold chicken in half crosswise and insert 2 slices of tomato into each pocket. Season outside of pockets with 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper (total), then brush with 1/2 tablespoon oil.
Heat remaining tablespoon oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Add chicken and brown 2 minutes per side. Reduce heat to low and cover skillet, then cook until chicken is just cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes more. Serve with pan juices.

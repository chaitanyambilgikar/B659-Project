Preheat broiler.
Butter one side of bread slices. On a baking sheet set 4 inches from heat broil both side of bread until toasted lightly. Rub buttered side of each toast with garlic. Arrange 4 toasts, garlic side up, on a baking sheet and divide pickle and corned beef among them. Top beef with onion mixture and cheese and broil under broiler about 4 inches from heat until cheese is melted. Top sandwiches with remaining toasts, garlic side down, and halve.

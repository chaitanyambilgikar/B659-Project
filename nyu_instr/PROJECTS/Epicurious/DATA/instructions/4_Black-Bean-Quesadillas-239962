Heat dry grill pan over medium heat until hot.
Toss together beans, cheese, 3/4 cup cilantro, and 1/2 cup onion. Divide mixture evenly over half of each tortilla (about 1/2 cup each), then fold tortillas in half.
Brush 1/2 tablespoon oil on grill pan, then cook 4 quesadillas, turning over once, until golden and cheese is melted, about 4 minutes total. Repeat with remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil and 4 quesadillas.
Meanwhile, pulse tomatoes, hot sauce, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and remaining cup each onion and cilantro in a food processor until coarsely chopped. Serve salsa with quesadillas.

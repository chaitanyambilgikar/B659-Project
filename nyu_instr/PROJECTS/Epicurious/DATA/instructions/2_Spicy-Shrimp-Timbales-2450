Heat 2 teaspoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add leeks and sauté until brown, about 5 minutes. Add shrimp and crushed red pepper and sauté until shrimp are opaque in center, about 4 minutes. Transfer shrimp mixture to large bowl. Refrigerate until cold.
Mix all remaining ingredients into shrimp mixture. Place 3-inch-diameter ring mold or empty tuna can with top and bottom removed in center of 1 plate. Spoon scant 1/2 cup shrimp mixture into ring mold. Using back of spoon, spread to sides of mold. Carefully lift off ring mold. Repeat with remaining shrimp mixture on remaining 7 plates.

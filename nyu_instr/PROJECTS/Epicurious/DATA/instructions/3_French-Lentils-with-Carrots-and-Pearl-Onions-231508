Blanch pearl onions in a 3- to 4-quart heavy saucepan of boiling water 1 minute, then drain and peel.
Heat butter in dry cleaned saucepan over moderate heat until foam subsides, then cook onions, carrots, garlic, salt, pepper, thyme, and bay leaf, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are softened, 6 to 8 minutes.
Add lentils and water and bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, partially covered, until lentils are just tender, 12 to 20 minutes. Discard thyme and bay leaf. Transfer lentils to a serving dish using a slotted spoon. Sprinkle with parsley.

Trim the feathery tops from the fennel bulbs, reserving several for garnish, and trim the stalks to the point where they meet the bulb, reserving them for another use. Quarter the bulbs, discarding the core, and slice the quarters thin crosswise. In a large bowl combine the fennel, the artichoke hearts, the tomatoes, and the olives. In a bowl whisk together the anchovy past, the oil, the lemon juice, the orégano, and the thyme. Toss the fennel mixture with the dressing, season it with the pepper and salt, and garnish the salad with the reserved fennel tops.

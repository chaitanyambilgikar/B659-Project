Very thinly slice truffles with a truffle slicer or other small manual slicer or with a sharp thin knife. Cut out 48 circles from slices with round cutter. Mince enough scraps to measure 1 tablespoon and reserve with 2 teaspoons juice from jar if using preserved truffles.
Whisk oil into lemon juice in a small bowl and season with salt and pepper. Spoon 1 1/2 tablespoons of vinaigrette into another small bowl and add truffle circles. Marinate truffle circles, covered and chilled, 1 hour, or until ready to use.
While truffle circles are marinating, cover quail eggs with water by 1 inch in a small saucepan. Simmer, covered, 5 minutes, then refresh under cold water to stop cooking. Peel eggs and halve lengthwise.
Carefully push out yolks and mash with chives, minced truffles (and any juice if using preserved truffles), and remaining vinaigrette to create a paste. Season with salt and pepper and transfer mixture to pastry bag fitted with tip. Chill deviled yolks in bag until ready to use.
Arrange egg white halves on a platter and pipe in just enough deviled yolks to fill holes (do not mound). Cover each yolk with a truffle circle.

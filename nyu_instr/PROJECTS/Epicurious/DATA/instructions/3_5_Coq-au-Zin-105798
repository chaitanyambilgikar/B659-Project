Preheat oven to 350°F. Place 1 cup flour in shallow dish. Cook chopped bacon in heavy large pot over medium-high heat until crisp, about 4 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper-towel-lined plate to drain. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to bacon drippings in pot. Sprinkle chicken thighs with salt and pepper. Working in batches, coat chicken thighs with flour and add to pot; sear until brown, about 4 minutes per side. Arrange chicken thighs in 15x10x2-inch glass baking dish.
Pour off all but 3 tablespoons fat from pot. Add shallots and garlic to pot and sauté 1 minute. Add onions, crimini mushrooms, and marjoram and sauté until onions begin to brown, about 10 minutes. Add red Zinfandel and bring to boil, scraping up browned bits. Add chicken stock and bacon; boil 5 minutes. Pour wine mixture over chicken in baking dish. Cover tightly with foil; bake until chicken is cooked through, about 1 hour.
Using tongs, transfer chicken thighs to platter. Strain wine mixture from baking dish into heavy medium saucepan. Transfer onion and mushroom mixture to platter with chicken; tent with foil to keep warm. Mix 2 tablespoons flour and butter in small bowl to blend. Bring wine mixture to boil. Whisk in flour mixture and boil until sauce thickens and is reduced to 2 3/4 cups, about 8 minutes. Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.
Ladle sauce over chicken and vegetables; sprinkle with chives.

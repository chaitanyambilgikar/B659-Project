For Bobby's Dry Rub: Combine all the ingredients in a small bowl. Makes about 1 1/4 cups. Any extra will keep in a tightly covered glass jar for several months.
For the Steaks: Preheat a gas or charcoal grill to high. Rub each steak on one side with the dry rub, brush with olive oil, and grill, rub-side down, until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn over and continue grilling 4 to 5 minutes for medium rare. Place on a large serving platter and brush with Mesa Barbecue Sauce.

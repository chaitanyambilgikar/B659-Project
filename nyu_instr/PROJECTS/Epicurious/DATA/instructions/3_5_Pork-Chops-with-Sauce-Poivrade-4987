Heat 1 tablespoon oil in heavy large roasting pan over medium heat. Add riblets; sauté until brown, about 10 minutes. Stir 1/3 cup water into roasting pan, scraping up any browned bits. Simmer until liquid is almost evaporated, about 8 minutes. Add 2 cups stock. Simmer until liquid is reduced to 1/4 cup, about 12 minutes. Add remaining 2 cups stock, jelly and vinegar. Simmer until sauce is reduced to 1 cup, about 10 minutes. Strain into heavy small saucepan; discard solids. Add peppercorns. Bring to simmer. Stir in cornstarch mixture. Simmer until sauce thickens, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, sprinkle pork chops with salt and pepper. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in heavy large skillet over high heat. Add pork chops to skillet; cook until brown and just cooked through, about 4 minutes per side.
Spoon sauce onto plates. Top with pork chops. Spoon cabbage and compote alongside pork chops and serve.

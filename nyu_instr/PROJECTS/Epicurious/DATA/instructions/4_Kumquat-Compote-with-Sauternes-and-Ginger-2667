Combine Sauternes, sugar, water and whole cloves in heavy medium saucepan. Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add bean. Bring mixture to boil. Add kumquats and boil until tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer kumquats to medium bowl using slotted spoon. Continue boiling syrup until reduced to generous 3/4 cup, about 3 minutes. Discard bean. Pour syrup over kumquats. Mix in crystallized ginger. Cover and refrigerate compote until chilled, about 3 hours. (Can be prepared 3 days ahead.)

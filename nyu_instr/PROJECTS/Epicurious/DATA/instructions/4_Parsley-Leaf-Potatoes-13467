Preheat oven to 450°F.
Pour butter into 1 large or 2 small shallot baking pans and tilt to coat. Put potatoes, 1 at a time, on a work surface and halve horizontally. Put a parsley leaf on cut side of each potato half and season potatoes with salt. Put potatoes, cut sides down, in melted butter. Sprinkle potatoes with salt to taste and roast, cut sides down, 35 minutes, or until golden. (Potatoes may be kept warm, covered with foil, about 15 minutes.)

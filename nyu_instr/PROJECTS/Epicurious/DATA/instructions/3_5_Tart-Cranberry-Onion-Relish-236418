Stir together all ingredients in a 2- to 3-quart heavy saucepan, then bring to a boil, covered. Remove lid and reduce heat, then simmer until cranberries have burst, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and cool, uncovered. Chill, covered, at least 8 hours for flavors to meld. Serve at room temperature.

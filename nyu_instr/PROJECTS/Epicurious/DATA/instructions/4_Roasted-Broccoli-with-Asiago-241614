Preheat oven to 450°F. Cut each crown of broccoli lengthwise into 4 spears. Place broccoli in large bowl; toss with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Transfer broccoli to large rimmed baking sheet. Add grated Asiago cheese to same bowl. Roast broccoli until crisp-tender and stalks begin to brown, about 25 minutes. Return broccoli to bowl with cheese. Using tongs, toss to coat.

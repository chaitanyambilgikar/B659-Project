Brown the chicken pieces in the butter, turning each piece to color evenly. When browned, season to taste with salt and pepper and add 1/2 to 3/4 cup white wine. Reduce heat and continue cooking until chicken is tender. You may cover the pan during part of the cooking time, which speeds the process, or cook uncovered. Any additional flavorings that you choose may be added during the cooking and the chicken pieces should be turned over once or twice to bathe them thoroughly in the flavorings and juices. When the chicken is tender and cooked, remove it to a hot platter. Rinse the pan with a little additional wine and let it cook down with the juices for a few minutes. Pour pan juices over the chicken and garnish with a little parsley or chives.
Drink the same wine you used in the cooking: Pouilly Fuissé, Meursault, or White Pinot from California.

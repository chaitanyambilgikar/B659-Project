Combine berries, sugar and juice in heavy large skillet. Bring to boil, stirring until sugar dissolves. Simmer over medium heat until berries burst, stirring often, about 5 minutes. Puree in processor until smooth. Strain into same skillet.
Bring puree to simmer over medium heat. Add pear wedges and stir to coat. Simmer until pears are just tender, about 8 minutes. Using slotted spoon, remove pears from skillet, shaking excess puree back into skillet, and transfer pears to paper-towel-lined plate. Reserve puree. (Can be prepared 2 days ahead. Cover pears and puree separately and refrigerate.)

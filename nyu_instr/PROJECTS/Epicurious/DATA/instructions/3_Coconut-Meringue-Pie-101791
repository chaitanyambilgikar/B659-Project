Prebake pie shell according to package instructions and cool completely.
Preheat oven to 350°F.
In a bowl whisk together yolks, cream of coconut, and buttermilk and stir in coconut. Pour filling into shell and bake in middle of oven 35 minutes, or until filling is set. Remove pie from oven and keep oven on.
Make meringue immediately: In a large bowl with an electric mixer beat whites with cream of tartar until they hold soft peaks. Gradually beat in sugar and beat until meringue holds stiff, glossy peaks. Spoon meringue onto pie, covering it completely and sealing meringue to pastry. Draw meringue up into peaks and bake in middle of oven until golden, about 15 minutes.
Cool pie completely on a rack. Serve pie at room temperature.

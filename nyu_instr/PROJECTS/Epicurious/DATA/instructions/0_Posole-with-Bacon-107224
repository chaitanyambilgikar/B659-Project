Rinse posole in a sieve under cold running water, then soak in a bowl of cold water to cover by 1 inch, chilled, 8 to 24 hours.
Drain and rinse soaked posole under cold running water, then transfer to a 6-quart pot. Add 4 quarts water, bacon, garlic, onion, and oregano (do not add salt) and simmer gently, uncovered, over low heat until posole has flowered (burst open) and liquid just barely covers posole, 3 to 3 1/2 hours. Discard garlic cloves and oregano sprigs, then stir in salt and simmer 5 to 10 minutes more.

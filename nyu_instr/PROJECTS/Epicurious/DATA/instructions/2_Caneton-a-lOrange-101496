Make duck: Prepare ducks for roasting. Place in pan with carrots, onions, a little thyme, and a bay leaf. Roast at 325°F. for 50 minutes to one hour, so the meat still shows a little blood when pricked with a toothpick and skewer. Remove and keep hot. Place roasting pan on heat and cook for a few minutes. Skim off excess fat and rinse pan with white wine and consommé. Cook for 5 minutes. Stain mixture through a fine sieve. Melt 2 tablespoons sugar in a heavy pan over low heat and just as it begins to carmelize, add vinegar and fruit juices. Add strained pan juices. Bring to a boil. Skim off excess fat. Mix flour with a little water and blend with sauce; cook until thickened to a syrupy consistency. Correct seasoning. Add Kitchen Bouquet to give rich color. Carve meat of one duck and arrange slices overlapping on top of second duck. Garnish with sections of orange. Add liqueur, 1/4 cup sugar, and cognac to sauce and carefully pour sauce over and around duck. Garnish the platter with potatoes. Serve peas separately.
Make potatoes: Cook potatoes in boiling, salted water until tender. Drain and peel. Put through food mill or ricer. Blend in 6 tablespoons butter, cream and one by one, egg yolks, beating well after each addition. Flavor with finely grated orange peel. Roll into long cork shapes, dip in flour, beaten egg, and fine bread crumbs and quickly deep fry in hot fat until golden brown.
With this, drink a light Bordeaux.

Preheat oven to 350°F.
Line bottom of a 10-inch-diameter springform pan with parchment paper, brush with oil, and lightly flour.
Gently toss prepared fruit with 1 tablespoon of sugar and set aside. (If using chocolate, do not toss it with the sugar, just put aside until needed.)
Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl and set aside.
Using an electric mixer, beat the egg with the 1/2 cup of superfine sugar and lemon zest until light, fluffy, and pale in color. This could take as long as 5 minutes.
Add the olive oil, then the milk and balsamic vinegar, beating until fully combined.
Using a rubber spatula, fold in the flour mixture.
Pour batter into the prepared springform pan and drop the sliced fruit over the top. Sprinkle with a tablespoon of sugar.
Bake for 50 minutes, until the top is a beautiful golden brown. A knife blade inserted into the cake’s center should come out clean.

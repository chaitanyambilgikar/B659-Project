In a large heavy skillet sauté the garlic in the oil over moderately high heat for 30 seconds, or until it is fragrant, add the watercress, and stir the mixture until it is combined well. Sauté the watercress, covered, for 2 to 3 minutes, or until it is just wilted, and season it with salt and pepper.

Preheat oven to 300°F.
Make crust: Pulse crust ingredients in a food processor until crumbly but moist.
Lightly oil 6 (1/3-cup) muffin cups and line bottoms with rounds of parchment or wax paper. Divide crust mixture among muffin cups and firmly press into an even layer on bottoms.
Make filling and bake cakes: Purée cottage cheese in food processor until completely smooth, scraping down bowl several times. Add remaining filling ingredients and blend until smooth. Spoon into muffin cups. Bake cheesecakes in a hot water bath in middle of oven until firm, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove muffin pan and cool on a rack. Chill, covered, 2 hours.
Make syrup while cakes are baking: Bring sugar and water to a boil in a small saucepan over high heat, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Boil until reduced to about 1/4 cup. Stir in Tokay and transfer to a bowl. Cover and chill.
To serve cakes: Run a wet small knife around edges of cheesecakes and invert onto a baking sheet. Serve drizzled with syrup.

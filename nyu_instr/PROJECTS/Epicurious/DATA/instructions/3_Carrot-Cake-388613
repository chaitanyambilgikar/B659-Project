1 Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease two 9-inch round pans or one 9 by 13-inch pan or with cooking spray or oil. In addition, you can also place a cut-out parchment circle on the bottom of the pan.
2 Grate the carrots with a grater (the old-school way!) or a food processor. I prefer medium-grated carrots—not too big, not too fine.
3 In a large bowl, mix together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, salt, confectioner's sugar, and brown sugar. Stir in the oil and eggs, then the carrots.
4 Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 30 to 40 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean.
5 Cool completely, then frost cream cheese frosting.

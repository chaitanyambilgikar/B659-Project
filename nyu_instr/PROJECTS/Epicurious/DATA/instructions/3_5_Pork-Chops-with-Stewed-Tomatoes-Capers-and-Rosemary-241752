Coarsely chop tomatoes in can with kitchen shears.
Pat pork dry, then sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers, then brown chops, turning once, about 5 minutes total. Transfer to a plate and cover with foil.
Add remaining tablespoon oil to skillet and sauté garlic over medium-high heat 30 seconds. Add tomatoes and remaining ingredients and simmer, stirring once or twice, 3 minutes. Add pork with any juices from plate, turning to coat, and simmer, uncovered, until just cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.

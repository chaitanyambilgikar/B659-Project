Heat olive oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add bacon and sauté until crisp, about 3 minutes. Add endive and sauté until endive is golden, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and cook until endive is tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer mixture to medium bowl. Stir in Parmesan and lemon juice. Season topping with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 4 hours ahead. Cover and chill.)
Preheat oven to 500°F. Place crust on large baking sheet. Spoon topping over crust, leaving 1-inch border around edge. Sprinkle Fontina over topping. Bake pizza until cheese melts and crust is crisp, about 8 minutes. Cut pizza into wedges.

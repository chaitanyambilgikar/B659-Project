Lightly score each sardine crosswise on the skin side, three times per fillet. In a nonreactive bowl, combine the sardines, lemon juice, salt, garlic, and shallots. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours. Before serving, drain the sardines, discarding the lime juice, garlic, and shallots. In a bowl, blend together the marinade ingredients. Add the sardines and gently toss. Garnish with crème fraîche.

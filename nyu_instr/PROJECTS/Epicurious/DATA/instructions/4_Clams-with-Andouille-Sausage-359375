Melt butter in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add andouille sausage, poblano chiles, all bell peppers, and crushed red pepper. Sauté until sausage browns and vegetables begin to soften, stirring often, about 7 minutes. Add clams, Sherry, and cream. Cover pot and cook over medium-high heat until clams open, 5 to 6 minutes (discard any clams that do not open). Stir in 1/4 cup cilantro and Sherry wine vinegar. Season juices to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer to large bowl. Sprinkle with remaining cilantro and serve. Adapted from Elliot's Oyster House.
* Often called pasillas; available at some supermarkets and at specialty foods stores, farmers’ markets, and Latin markets.
Ingredient tip: Although native to Japan, Manila clams are becoming increasingly popular in the United States and can be found in the seafood section of most supermarkets. Pacific littleneck clams are a good substitute.

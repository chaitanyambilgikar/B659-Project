Smear chicken with mixture. Heat 1 tablespoon lard or cooking oil in frying pan. Add onion and stir half minute. Add celery and water chestnuts and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Remove. Heat remaining 3 tablespoons lard or cooking oil. Add chicken meat and cook 2 minutes only (overcooking the diced chicken will ruin the dish). Return vegetables; add pineapple pieces.

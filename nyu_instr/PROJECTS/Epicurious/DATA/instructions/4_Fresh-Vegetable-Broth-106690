1. Place water in a large, heavy pot. Rinse all the vegetables well, then add to pot. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer, uncovered, for 1 hour. Adjust the seasonings to taste and simmer for 30 minutes longer.
2. Strain the broth; discard the bay leaf but reserve the vegetables to eat as is, or purâ€©e them and use to thicken soups or sauces for stews. Let the broth cool to room temperature and then refrigerate, covered, in a storage container or freeze. Refrigerated, it will keep about 4 days. This recipe is easily doubled, and you will need more than 4 cups of broth for three of our soups.

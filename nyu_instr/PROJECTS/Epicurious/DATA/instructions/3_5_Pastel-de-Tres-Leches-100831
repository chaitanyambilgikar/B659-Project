For Sponge Cake: Preheat oven to 350°F. Grease and flour cake pan, and line with parchment paper. Sift flour with baking powder and cinnamon. Using a standing mixer with the whisk attachment, beat egg whites until frothy, then slowly add sugar to tighten whites to semi stiff peaks. Add yolks one at a time. Alternate adding the flour mixture and the milk.
Pour batter into pan and bake for about 40 minutes or until the middle springs back when touched and edges pull slightly away from pan. Cool thoroughly on a wire rack.
For Rum Milk Syrup: In a large bowl, combine all ingredients. Whip thoroughly with a wire whisk and reserve. (If made in advance, refrigerate and stir before using.)
For Meringue: In a small saucepan, combine sugar and water, and bring to boil. When water begins to boil, begin whipping egg whites using a standing mixer with the whisk attachment.
When sugar reaches the soft ball stage on a candy thermometer, keep the egg whites mixing on slow speed, and steadily pour sugar into the side of the bowl (keeping it away from the whisk). Increase the speed to high, and whip until cool (5 minutes or less). Meringue should be smooth and shiny. Reserve.
For Cranberry Compote: In a saucepan, combine all ingredients except cornstarch. Bring to boil, then reduce heat and simmer for about 15 minutes, until the fruits are tender.
While stirring rapidly, add the cornstarch slurry, and allow the mixture to boil rapidly for one minute. Remove from heat, and remove the spices. Cool thoroughly and reserve.
To Assemble: Unmold cake while slightly warm, and slice off the hard top with a serrated knife. Place cake on serving platter and spoon rum syrup over cake a little at a time, until it is all absorbed, repeat until all the syrup is used. Ice the top of the cake with the meringue. Refrigerate until cool. Top with the compote or slice and serve it alongside the cake.

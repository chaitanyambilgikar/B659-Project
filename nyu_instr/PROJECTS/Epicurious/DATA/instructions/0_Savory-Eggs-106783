1. Place the eggs in a saucepan. Gently rinse with warm water and drain. Cover with cold water and place over medium-high heat; bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to a gentle simmer and cook for exactly 13 minutes. Drain the eggs, rinse under cold water, then peel. Let cool in the refrigerator, loosely covered, for 15 minutes.
2. Halve the eggs lengthwise and carefully scoop out the yolks. Place the yolks in a bowl and mash with a fork. Add the mustard, pickle relish, Tabasco, salt, pepper, and snipped chives. Stir in the mayonnaise.
3. Fill the whites with the egg yolk mixture and dust the tops lightly with paprika. Arrange the eggs in a spoke design on a decorative platter garnished with whole chives.

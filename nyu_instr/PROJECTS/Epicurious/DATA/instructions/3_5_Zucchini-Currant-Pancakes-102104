Preheat oven to 200°F. Whisk first 7 ingredients in large bowl. Whisk buttermilk, 3/4 cup oil and eggs in medium bowl. Add to dry ingredients and mix just until blended but still lumpy. Fold in zucchini and currants.
Heat griddle or heavy large skillet over medium heat. Brush lightly with vegetable oil. Working in batches, pour batter by 1/3 cupfuls onto griddle, spacing apart. Cook until bottoms are golden, about 2 minutes. Turn and cook until second sides are golden and pancakes are cooked through, about 2 minutes. Transfer to baking sheet; keep warm in oven. Serve hot with butter and syrup.

Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms, shallot and garlic and sauté until mushrooms are brown and tender, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer mixture to small bowl.
Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in same skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle steaks with salt and pepper. Add steaks to skillet and sauté just until brown, about 1 1/2 minutes per side. Remove skillet from heat. Top each steak with prosciutto slice, 1 tablespoon mushroom mixture, then cheese slice and parsley sprig. Cover; cook over medium-high heat until cheese melts, about 1 minute. Transfer steaks to plates; tent with foil.
Return remaining mushroom mixture to skillet. Add Marsala and boil until reduced almost to glaze, about 6 minutes. Spoon sauce over steaks.

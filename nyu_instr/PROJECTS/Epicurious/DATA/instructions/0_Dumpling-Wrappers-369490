To make the dough in an electric mixer, place the flour in the work bowl of the mixer and slowly mix in the boiling water with a dough hook and then add the cold water to form a dough. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead for an additional 5 minutes by hand, or until it is soft and smooth. Divide the dough in half and then roll into 2 cylinders (about 1 inch in diameter). Cover the cylinders with plastic wrap and let rest for 30 minutes. Alternatively, to make the dough by hand, place the flour in a large bowl and slowly stir in the boiling water. Then add the cold water and mix until well combined. Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and knead for 10 minutes, or until the dough is soft and smooth. Divide the dough in half and then roll into 2 cylinders (about 1 inch in diameter). Cover the cylinders with plastic wrap and let rest for 30 minutes.
Use a sharp knife to cut each of the cylinders into 26 rounds, and cover the rounds with plastic wrap when not working with them so that they don't dry out. Roll each round into a ball. Then on a lightly floured work surface, flatten each ball into a 3-inch-wide disk, first with the palm of your hand and then using a mini rolling pin and working in a circular motion. The wrappers will keep in the refrigerator wrapped in plastic wrap for up to 2 days.

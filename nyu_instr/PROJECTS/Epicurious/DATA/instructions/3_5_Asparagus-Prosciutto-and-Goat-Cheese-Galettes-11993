To prepare the onions: In a skillet cook onions in oil and butter with salt and pepper to taste over moderately low heat 15 minutes, or until golden. Transfer onions to a bowl to cool.
Have ready a large bowl of ice and cold water. Cut asparagus crosswise into 1/2-inch pieces and cook in a large saucepan of boiling salted water 3 to 5 minutes, or until just tender. Drain asparagus in a colander and transfer to bowl of ice and cold water to stop cooking. Lift asparagus out of water and pat dry.
Preheat oven to 400°F. Spread onions evenly onto galette rounds and top with prosciutto, asparagus, and goat cheese. Bake galettes on a baking sheet in middle of oven about 15 minutes, or until tops are lightly browned. Transfer galettes to a rack and cool. Serve galettes, cut into wedges, at room temperature.
To prepare the galette rounds: In a bowl whisk together milk, butter, yolks, and whole egg. In another bowl whisk together flour, salt, and chives and stir into milk mixture until just combined.
On a lightly floured surface with floured hands knead dough about 8 times, or until just smooth. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and chill hour.
Preheat oven to 450°F. Divide dough into 4 pieces. On a lightly floured surface with a floured rolling pin roll out each piece into an 8-inch round. Transfer rounds to 2 baking sheets and crimp edges decoratively. Chill dough 10 minutes and bake in middle and lower thirds of oven about 5 minutes, or until golden brown. Transfer galettes to racks and cool completely. Galettes may be made 1 day ahead and kept in a sealable plastic bag at room temperature. Makes 4 galettes rounds.

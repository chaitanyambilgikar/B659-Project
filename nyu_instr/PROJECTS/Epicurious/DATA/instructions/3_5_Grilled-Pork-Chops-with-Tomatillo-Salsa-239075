Preheat broiler. Place tomatillos, 4 whole garlic cloves, and jalapeños on rimmed baking sheet. Broil until tender and vegetables are slightly charred, turning occasionally, about 7 minutes for garlic and 8 minutes for tomatillos and jalapeños. Transfer to plate and let stand until cool enough to handle. Stem and seed jalapeños. Place tomatillos, garlic, jalapeños, onion, and cilantro in processor. Puree until almost smooth. Season tomatillo salsa with salt and pepper. DO AHEAD Salsa can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Return salsa to room temperature before serving.

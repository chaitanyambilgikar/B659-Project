Stir 1/2 cup water and sugar in medium saucepan over medium-low heat until sugar dissolves. Simmer until syrup is reduced slightly, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to very low. Add 3 cups miniature marshmallows; stir until marshmallows melt and sauce is smooth. Mix in 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract.
Stir chocolate, cream and butter in small saucepan over low heat until chocolate melts and sauce is smooth; mix in 1/2 teaspoon vanilla. (Sauces can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover separately and chill. Rewarm over low heat before using.)
Place ice cream in large bowl. Mix in 1 1/2 cups miniature marshmallows and graham cracker pieces. Freeze until firm, at least 2 hours.
Place 3 scoops of ice cream in each of 6 bowls. Thread large marshmallows onto 2 skewers; hold over gas flame or under broiler until charred. Spoon warm sauces over ice cream. Top each sundae with toasted marshmallow and graham cracker triangle and serve.

Boil apple cider in a small saucepan or skillet over moderate heat until reduced to about 2 tablespoons, 5 to 8 minutes. Cool to room temperature.
Shave fennel into 1/8-inch-thick slices with slicer.
Whisk together reduced cider syrup, vinegar, shallot, salt, and pepper in a small bowl, then add oil, whisking to combine. Toss with fennel, escarole, and lettuce in a large bowl just before serving.

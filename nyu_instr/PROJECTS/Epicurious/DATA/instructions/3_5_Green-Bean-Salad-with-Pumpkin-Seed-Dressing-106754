Toast pumpkin seeds in a dry small heavy skillet over moderately low heat, stirring frequently, until puffed but not browned, about 6 minutes. (If using pine nuts, toast until pale golden, about 7 minutes.) Transfer to a plate to cool. Reserve 1 tablespoon seeds, then purée remaining seeds in a blender with garlic, oil, water, lemon juice, cumin, salt, and 1 tablespoon cilantro until smooth.
Cook beans in a large pot of boiling salted water until just tender, 4 to 6 minutes. Drain in a colander, then plunge into a bowl of ice and cold water to stop cooking. Drain beans and pat dry.
Arrange beans on a plate and drizzle with two thirds of dressing. Top with tomatoes and remaining dressing, then sprinkle with remaining tablespoon cilantro and reserved pumpkin seeds.

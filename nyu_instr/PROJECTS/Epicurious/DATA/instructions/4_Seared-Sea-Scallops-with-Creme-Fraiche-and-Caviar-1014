Heat oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Season scallops with salt and pepper. Cook scallops until golden on bottom, about 2 minutes. Turn over; sauté until just cooked through, about 1 minute. Drain on paper towels. Cool to room temperature.
Top each scallop with 1/2 teaspoon crème fraîche. Top with caviar. Garnish with chives and serve.

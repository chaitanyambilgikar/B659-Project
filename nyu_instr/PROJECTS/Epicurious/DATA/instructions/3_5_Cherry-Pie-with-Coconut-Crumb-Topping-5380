Make topping Mix first 6 ingredients in medium bowl. Add butter; rub in with fingertips until mixture resembles coarse meal. Cover and refrigerate.
Make pie Roll out pastry between sheets of lightly floured waxed paper to 12-inch round, turning over occasionally and lifting and smoothing paper. Peel off top sheet of paper. Using bottom paper as aid, lift pastry and invert into 9-inch-diameter glass pie dish. Peel off paper. Press pastry gently into dish. Fold overhang under; crimp to form high-standing decorative edge. Chill 15 minutes.
Preheat oven to 425°F. Mix remaining ingredients in large bowl. Let stand until cherries release juices, about 10 minutes. Transfer cherry mixture to crust.
Bake pie 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 375°F. Transfer pie to baking sheet. Sprinkle topping over pie. Bake until cherries are tender and juices bubble thickly, covering pie loosely with foil if topping browns too quickly, about 50 minutes. Transfer to rack. Cool 30 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.

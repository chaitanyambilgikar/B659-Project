The crown is sometimes made with two rib ends of the loin and sometimes with the entire loin, which makes a most spectacular roast. Wrap the ends of the rib bones with foil to keep them from charring. Rub the meat with freshly ground black pepper, a bit of sage and rosemary, or just sage and garlic. Make a heavy cushion of foil to fill the center of the crown while roasting. Place on a rack and roast in a 325°F. oven, allowing about 25 minutes per pound. Baste from time to time with white wine.
While the roast is cooking, wash 3 pounds sauerkraut, and place it in a kettle lined with strips of bacon. Add 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, a few juniper berries, and enough white wine to barely cover the sauerkraut. Bring it to a boil and simmer. A half-hour before the roast is done, add a Polish or a garlic sausage to the sauerkraut and let them cook together. When the roast has reached an internal temperature of 170°F., remove it to a hot platter. Discard the foil and replace with paper frills.
Remove the foil from the center, fill the center with the sauerkraut, and garnish with slices of the sausage. Serve with boiled parsley potatoes and a salad of Bibb lettuce and grated beets. Drink a fruity Alsatian wine such as a Gewürztraminer.

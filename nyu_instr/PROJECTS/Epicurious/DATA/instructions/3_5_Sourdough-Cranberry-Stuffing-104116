Preheat the oven to 375°F. Cook the onion, celery, carrot, and butter in a large saucepan over medium-low heat for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the onions are translucent. Remove from the heat, add the chicken stock, sage, chives, thyme, and parsley, and stir well. Place the bread in a large bowl, pour the mixture from the saucepan over the bread, and toss until all the liquid is absorbed. Fold in the cranberries and season to taste with salt and pepper.
Transfer the mixture to a baking dish and bake for 50 to 60 minutes, or until golden brown.

Preheat broiler.
Remove husks and rinse tomatillos under warm water to remove stickiness. Halve onion half and arrange on rack of a broiler pan with tomatillos and garlic. Broil vegetables 1 to 2 inches from heat, turning them once, until softened and slightly charred, about 10 minutes.
Peel garlic and put in a food processor with tomatillos, onion, cilantro, and salt. Wearing rubber gloves, discard seeds from jalapeño if desired and coarsely chop. Add jalapeño to tomatillo mixture and puree until mixture is almost smooth. Transfer tomatillo mixture to a bowl.
Halve and pit avocado and scoop flesh into tomatillo mixture. With a fork mash avocado into mixture, leaving texture coarse.

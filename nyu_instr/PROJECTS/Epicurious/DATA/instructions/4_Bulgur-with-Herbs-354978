Put bulgur in a bowl, then pour hot water (2 cups) over it and cover bowl with plastic wrap. Let stand until tender, about 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a small heavy skillet over medium heat until hot, then cook almonds, stirring, until golden, about 1 minute.
Drain bulgur in a medium-mesh sieve, then return to bowl and stir in scallions, herbs, store-bought roasted-almond oil (or additional olive oil), 1 teaspoon lemon juice, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and almonds (with oil). Season with salt and more lemon juice if desired. Serve at room temperature.

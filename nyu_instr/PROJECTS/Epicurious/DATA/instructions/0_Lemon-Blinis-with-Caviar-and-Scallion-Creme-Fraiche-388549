Stir together crème fraîche and 1 tablespoon of the scallions.
Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large non-stick skillet over low heat and scrap into a small bowl. Whisk in milk, egg, and 1 teaspoon zest. Add flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt and whisk until smooth.
Melt half of remaining butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium-low heat.
Drop 6 rounded teaspoons of batter into skillet and cook until tiny bubbles form on the surface, edges appear dry, and undersides are golden, about 2 to 3 minutes.
Flip and cook until golden and cooked through, about 1 to 2 minutes more. Transfer to a plate and cover with foil to keep warm.
Melt remaining 1/2 tablespoon butter in skillet and make 6 more blinis (you will have a little batter left over).
To serve, top blinis with a small dollop of scallion crème fraîche and some caviar, then sprinkle with remaining lemon zest and scallion.

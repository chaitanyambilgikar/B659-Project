Preheat the oven to 350° F. Line the base and two long sides of a 10 3/4 x 7-inch shallow cake pan with baking paper.
Put the butter, sugar, and vanilla in a bowl and beat with electric beaters until creamy. Sift together the all-purpose flour, ginger, and baking powder. Use a metal spoon to stir the flour mixture into the butter mixture in two batches until well incorporated. Use your fingers to press firmly and evenly into the prepared pan. Bake for 20 minutets, or until pale golden and firm to touch.
Meanwhile, to make the ginger frosting, put the butter, golden syrup, ginger, and confectioners' sugar in a small saucepan. Stir over low heat until smooth. Pour and spread the frosting evenly over the bar while the bar is hot. Mark into 16 slices and scatter over the crystallized ginger. Set aside to cool, then cut, using marks as a guide.

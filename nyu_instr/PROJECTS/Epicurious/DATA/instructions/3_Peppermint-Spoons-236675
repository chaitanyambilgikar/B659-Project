Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 300°F. Roll up a 10-inch-long sheet of foil to form a 1/2-inch-thick log.
Place 2 candies in each of 4 spoons. Arrange spoons on baking sheet, propping up spoon handles slightly using foil log to make spoons level.
Bake until candy softens, about 10 minutes, then transfer sheet to a rack. Wearing an oven mitt and working quickly, push down firmly on melted candy in each hot spoon using back of remaining spoon so that candy spreads to rim of each spoon. Cool completely, about 10 to 15 minutes.

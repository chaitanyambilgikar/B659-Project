Quarter the cucumber lengthwise and trim off the triangular wedge of seeds. Cut the cucumber into a very small, even dice. Transfer it to a mixing bowl.
In a food processor, combine the garlic, vinegar, shallots, and dill. Pulse until finely chopped but not puréed. Add the mixture to the cucumbers; add the yogurt. Fold together with a rubber spatula, adding olive oil and lemon juice. Season liberally with kosher salt and pepper, starting off with 1 tablespoon salt. Taste for seasoning. You can store Tzatsiki in a covered, clean jar in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.
* The Wedge: Smear some Tzatsiki onto a pita triangle. Top with a tiny pinch of dry Greek oregano, a few pieces of diced tomato or a halved grape or cherry tomato, and a few salami matchsticks.

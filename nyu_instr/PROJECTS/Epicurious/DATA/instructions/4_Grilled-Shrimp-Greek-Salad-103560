Prepare grill for cooking.
Make dressing: Whisk together 2 tablespoons lemon juice, 3 tablespoons oil, half of oregano, half of garlic, and salt and pepper to taste in a large bowl.
Gently stir tomatoes, cucumber, and onion into dressing and let stand at room temperature while grilling.
Marinate shrimp: Whisk together remaining 2 tablespoons lemon juice and remaining oregano and garlic in a large bowl. Stir in shrimp until well coated and marinate at room temperature 10 minutes.
Grill pitas and bell pepper while shrimp marinates: Lightly brush pitas and bell pepper on both sides with some oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill pitas on an oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals until browned and slightly crisp, about 2 minutes on each side, then transfer to a rack to cool (pitas will continue to crisp as they cool).
Grill bell pepper until just softened, about 1 1/2 minutes on each side.
Grill shrimp: Add remaining tablespoon oil to shrimp and toss to coat. Thread 4 shrimp lengthwise, each facing in same direction (so shrimp will lay flat on grill), on each skewer without crowding. Season shrimp with salt and pepper.
Grill shrimp until just cooked through, about 2 minutes on each side.
Break pitas into bite-size pieces and coarsely chop bell pepper. Remove shrimp from skewers and gently stir into tomato mixture with pitas, bell pepper, feta, and salt and pepper to taste.

Roll out pastry on floured surface to 11-inch squares. Using small plate as guide, cut four 5- to 5 1/2-inch rounds from each square. Transfer rounds to 2 heavy baking sheets. Cover; chill. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Keep chilled.)
Mix sugar and 1/2 cup water in heavy medium saucepan. Scrape in seeds from vanilla beans. Stir over medium-low heat until sugar dissolves, occasionally brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush. Increase heat; boil until syrup is deep amber color, swirling pan occasionally, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat. Add 1 cup water (syrup will bubble vigorously), then rum. Stir over very low heat until caramel bits dissolve. Simmer 2 minutes. Cool syrup 15 minutes. Pour into blender. Add banana, ginger, and chiles de árbol; puree until sauce is smooth.
Preheat oven to 350°F. Place pineapple in 13x9x2-inch glass baking dish. Pour sauce over; turn pineapple to coat. Roast until tender, basting often with sauce and adding more water by tablespoonfuls if sauce becomes thick, about 1 hour 15 minutes. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Chill until cold, then cover and keep chilled.)
Preheat oven to 375°F. Transfer pineapple to work surface, scraping any sauce back into dish. Cut pineapple crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick rounds. Cut out core from each round. Place 1 pineapple round in center of each pastry round. Brush pineapple with sauce. Brush pastry edges with egg glaze.
Bake tartlets until pastry is brown, about 25 minutes. Rewarm sauce. Top each tartlet with scoop of vanilla ice cream; drizzle with warm sauce and serve.

Preheat the oven to 350°F. In a small bowl toss the bread cubes with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and salt to taste and on a baking sheet toast them in the middle of the oven for 10 minutes, or until they are golden. Transfer the croutons to a salad bowl and let them cool. In a blender or small food processor blend together the garlic, the vinegar, the water, 3 tablespoons of the Parmesan, the orégano, the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, and salt and pepper to taste until the dressing is combined well. To the croutons add the romaine, the onion, and the dressing, toss the salad well, and sprinkle it with the additional Parmesan.

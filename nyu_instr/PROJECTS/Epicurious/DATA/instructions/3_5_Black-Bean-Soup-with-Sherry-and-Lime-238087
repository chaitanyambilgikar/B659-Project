Purée black beans in batches in a blender (use caution if beans are hot) and transfer as puréed to a 2 1/2- to 3-quart heavy saucepan. Stir in 1 cup water, Sherry, lime juice, and salt to taste, then thin soup, if necessary, to desired consistency with additional water. Bring to a simmer over moderate heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes.

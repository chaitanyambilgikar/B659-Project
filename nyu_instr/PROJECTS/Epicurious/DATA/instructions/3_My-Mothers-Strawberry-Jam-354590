Cook berries in a heavy pan over low heat, stirring every 15 minutes, until jamlike in consistency, about 3 hours. Add sugar, using more (up to 3/4 cup) if you like your jam sweeter, and stir until dissolved. Transfer jam to a jar, let cool and refrigerate. It's a fresh jam, so keep it refrigerated for no more than 2 weeks. Makes about 3 1/2 cups.

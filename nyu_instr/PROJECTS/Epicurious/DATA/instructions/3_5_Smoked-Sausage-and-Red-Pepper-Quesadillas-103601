Preheat oven to 350°F. Brush baking sheet with oil. Gently mix salsa, avocado and 1/4 cup cilantro in medium bowl.
Sauté sausage slices in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat until just brown, about 2 minutes. Set aside. Cook tortillas, 1 at a time, directly over gas flame until beginning to brown in spots, about 30 seconds per side. Arrange 6 tortillas on prepared sheet. Layer tortillas on sheet with 1 cup Monterey Jack cheese, feta cheese, sausage slices, red peppers, 1/4 cup cilantro, then 1 cup Monterey Jack cheese, dividing equally. Press each remaining tortilla atop filling and brush with olive oil.
Bake quesadillas until golden and cheeses melt, about 15 minutes. Cut into wedges; serve with salsa mixture.

Brew espresso with 3 cups water in coffeemaker. Pour coffee into small metal pan. Add 1/2 cup sugar; stir to dissolve. Freeze 2 hours, stirring twice. Cover and freeze without stirring until solid, at least 6 hours or overnight. Using fork, scrape granita into icy crystals, then toss to mix. Cover; keep frozen. Mix orange juice, liqueur, orange peel, and 1 tablespoon sugar in medium bowl until sugar dissolves. Transfer 2 tablespoons mixture to small bowl to use as sauce; chill.
Mix ice cream into remaining orange mixture. Cover; freeze until firm, at least 6 hours.
Coarsely crumble 1 to 1 1/2 cookies into each of 4 parfait glasses. Top each with 1/2 cup granita and another 1 to 1 1/2 crumbled cookies. Top each with scoop of ice cream. Drizzle 1 1/2 teaspoons orange sauce over ice cream. Garnish with orange slices, if desired. * Available at some supermarkets and at Italian markets.

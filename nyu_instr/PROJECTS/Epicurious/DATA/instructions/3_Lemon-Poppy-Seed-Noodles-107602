Cook noodles in a large pot of boiling salted water until tender. While noodles are cooking, lightly toast poppy seeds in a dry small skillet over moderately low heat, stirring, until just fragrant, about 2 minutes.
Reserve 1/2 cup cooking water and drain noodles in a colander. Add butter and zest to warm pot and swirl until melted. Add noodles and toss, adding enough of reserved cooking water to keep noodles moist, then stir in poppy seeds, chives, and salt and pepper to taste.

Fill a skillet with enough salted water to reach 1/2 inch up the side and bring the water to a boil. Add the shrimp and simmer them, covered, shaking the skillet occasionally, for 1 to 2 minutes, or until they are pink and just firm. Transfer the shrimp with a slotted spoon to a bowl of ice water, discard the shells, and halve the shrimp lengthwise, deveining them. The shrimp may be prepared up to 1 day in advance and kept covered and chilled.
Peel and pit the avocados and in a bowl mash them with a fork. Add the salt, the cayenne, the lemon juice, and the tomatoes and combine the mixture well.
Just before serving spread the tortilla chips with the avocado mixture, top the mixture with half a shrimp, and garnish each hors d'oeuvres with 1 of the parsley leaves if desired.

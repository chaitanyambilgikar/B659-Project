Transfer turkey to platter; tent loosely with foil. Let stand 30 minutes (internal temperature of turkey will increase 5 to 10 degrees). Using slotted spoon, transfer shallots to bowl. Discard turkey neck.

Melt 2 tablespoons reserved turkey fat in heavy large saucepan over medium-low heat. Add flour and stir 1 minute. Gradually whisk in pan juices. Boil until sauce thickens very slightly, whisking occasionally, about 5 minutes (gravy will be thin). Stir reserved sliced 1/2 truffle into gravy. Season with salt and pepper. Cover to keep warm.

Stir 2/3 cup sugar, 1/2 cup water and star anise in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Bring to boil. Add orange liqueur. Simmer until syrupy, about 3 minutes. Add apricots and cook until apricots soften, stirring occasionally, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat. Cover and keep warm. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Rewarm over medium-low heat before using.)
Whisk milk and eggs in 13 x 9 x 2-inch baking dish. Add bread in single layer. Let stand until liquid is absorbed, about 5 minutes per side.
Cook 2 tablespoons butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat until butter begins to foam. Add 3 bread slices to skillet and cook until golden, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to warm platter. Repeat with remaining 2 tablespoons butter and 3 bread slices.
Divide pain perdu among 6 plates. Spoon warm apricots and syrup over, discarding star anise. Dust with powdered sugar and serve.

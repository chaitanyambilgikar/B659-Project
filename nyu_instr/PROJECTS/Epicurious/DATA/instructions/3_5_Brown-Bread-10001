Preheat oven to 350°F, and grease and flour a loaf pan, 9 1/4 by 5 1/4 by 2 3/4 inches, knocking out excess flour.
In a large bowl whisk together dry ingredients. Stir in remaining ingredients until just combined.
Pour batter into prepared pan and bake in middle of oven until a tester comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool bread in pan on a rack 5 minutes. Turn loaf out onto rack and cool completely before slicing.

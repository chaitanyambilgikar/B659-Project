In a small bowl whisk together the eggs, the aquavit, and salt and peeper to taste. In an 8-inch non-stick skillet heat the butter over high heat until the foam subsides. Add the egg mixture, reduce the heat to moderate, and cook the mixture until the omelet is just set but still soft and moist. Arrange the smoked salmon on the omelet, sprinkle it with the scallion, and spoon 1/4 cup of the sour cream over it. Cook the omelet for 10 to 15 seconds more, or until the underside is golden, fold it over, and slide it onto a heated platter. Serve the omelet with the bread and the additional sour cream.

In a large saucepan bring 1 cup unsalted water to a boil, add the peas, and return the water to a boil, separating the peas with a fork. Simmer the peas, covered, for 3 to 4 minutes, or until they are heated through, and drain them well. Toss the peas with the butter and salt and pepper to taste, transfer them to a heated serving dish, and sprinkle them with the zest.

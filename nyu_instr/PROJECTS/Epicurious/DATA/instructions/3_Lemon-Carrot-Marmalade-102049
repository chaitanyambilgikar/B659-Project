Grind the lemons and carrots together in a meat grinder, using the coarsest blade. Combine all the ingredients in a large pot and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, for 1 hour or until juice has thickened. Pour into hot, sterilized jelly glasses and cover with a thin layer of melted paraffin. When the paraffin has hardened, cover the glasses and store.

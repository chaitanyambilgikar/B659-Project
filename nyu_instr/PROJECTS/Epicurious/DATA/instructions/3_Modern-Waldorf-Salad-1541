Mix mayonnaise, yogurt, orange juice, orange peel and Cajun seasoning in small bowl to blend. (Dressing can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
Line large bowl with large outer leaves of lettuce. Chop enough remaining leaves into bite-size pieces to measure 6 cups (reserve remaining lettuce for another use). Place chopped lettuce in another large bowl. Using small sharp knife, cut off peel and white pith from grapefruit. Cut between membranes to release grapefruit segments. Cut segments in half. Place in bowl with chopped lettuce. Add diced pear, diced apple, halved grapes and chopped dates. Add dressing to salad and toss to coat.
Transfer salad to leaf-lined bowl. Sprinkle salad with pine nuts and serve.

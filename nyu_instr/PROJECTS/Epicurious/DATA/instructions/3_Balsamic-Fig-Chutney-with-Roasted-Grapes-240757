Preheat oven to 425°F. Place grapes on rimmed baking sheet. Toss with 1 teaspoon oil. Roast until shiny and plump, about 10 minutes; set aside.
Using vegetable peeler, remove peel (orange part only) from orange in long strips. Thinly slice strips lengthwise. Juice orange. Measure 1/3 cup (reserve leftover juice for another use). Heat 1 teaspoon oil in large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add garlic; stir 30 seconds. Add 2 cups water and tea bags. Increase heat; bring to boil. Remove tea bags, squeezing to release liquid. Add figs to pan; cover. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer until figs are soft, about 10 minutes. Uncover pan; boil until liquid is reduced almost to glaze and just covers bottom of pan, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in remaining ingredients. Fold in grapes, juice, and peel. Ladle into jars. Cool. Cover; chill. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 month ahead; gently shake jars occasionally. Chill.

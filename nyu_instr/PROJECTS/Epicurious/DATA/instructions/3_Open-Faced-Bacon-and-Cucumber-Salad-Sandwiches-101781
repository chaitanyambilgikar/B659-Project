In a fine sieve set over a bowl drain yogurt 20 minutes. Lightly toast bread. Finely chop cucumber and in a bowl stir together with yogurt, garlic, and salt and pepper to taste.
In a large heavy skillet cook bacon over moderate heat, turning it, until it begins to brown and is almost crisp. Sprinkle sugar evenly over bacon and turn it. Cook bacon until golden and crisp and transfer to paper towels to drain. Divide cucumber salad between toasts and top with bacon.

1. Heat a large nonstick Dutch oven or one that has been sprayed with cooking spray. When hot, add the oil and onion and sauté over medium heat for about 5 minutes, or until the onion starts to soften.
2. Add the tomato sauce, cranberry sauce, horseradish, dry mustard, vinegar, and stock. Raise the heat and bring the sauce to a hard boil. Lower the heat to medium and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, for about 15 minutes.
3. Add the seitan. Lower the heat to a simmer and cook, covered, for 15 minutes more. Serve hot, or refrigerate overnight, reheat, and serve the next day.

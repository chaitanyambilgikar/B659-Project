Make pudding cake: Preheat oven to 350°F.
Whisk together flour, salt, and 1/2 cup sugar in a bowl. Whisk together yolks, milk, zest, and juice and add to dry ingredients, whisking until combined well.
Beat whites in a large bowl with an electric mixer until they hold soft peaks, then gradually add remaining 1/4 cup sugar, beating, and continue to beat until whites hold stiff, glossy peaks. Whisk about one fourth of whites into batter to lighten, then fold in remaining whites gently but thoroughly (batter will be thin).
Pour batter into a lightly oiled 1 1/2-quart gratin or other shallow baking dish and bake in a hot water bath until puffed and golden, 40 to 45 minutes.
Make syrup while cake is baking: Cook sugar in a dry 1 1/2-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat, undisturbed, until it begins to melt. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally with a fork, until sugar is melted and turns a deep golden caramel. Tilt pan and carefully add cranberries and water (caramel will harden and vigorously steam). Simmer over moderately low heat, stirring, until caramel is completely dissolved, then pour syrup through a very fine sieve into a heatproof bowl, pressing hard on solids. Serve pudding cake with syrup.

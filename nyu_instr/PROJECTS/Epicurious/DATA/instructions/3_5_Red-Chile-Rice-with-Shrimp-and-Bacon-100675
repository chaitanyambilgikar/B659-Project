Heat the oven to 350 degrees. In a 3-quart ovenproof saucepan, cook the bacon over medium heat, stirring, until crispy and brown, about 5 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon, leaving behind the fat (you'll need a generous tablespoon to fry the rice). Set the crisp bacon aside. Add the rice to the pan and cook, stirring, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes.
Add the salsa and stir for 1 minute, then add the broth, salt and green onions. Bring to a boil, stir once, cover tightly and bake for 25 minutes. Remove from the oven.
Uncover and lay the shrimp on top of the rice mixture; re-cover and bake until the shrimp is opaque, 7 to 10 minutes. Sprinkle with the cilantro and crispy bacon, mix everything thoroughly with a fork and serve.

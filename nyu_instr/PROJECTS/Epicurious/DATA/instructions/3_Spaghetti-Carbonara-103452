Combine bacon and butter in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Sauté until bacon is brown and crisp. Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towels and drain. Whisk cream, 1/2 cup grated cheese and egg yolks in medium bowl to blend; whisk in 2 tablespoons drippings from skillet. Set cream mixture aside; discard remaining drippings.
Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally. Drain pasta and return to same pot. Add cream mixture to pasta. Toss over medium-low heat until sauce cooks through and coats pasta thickly, about 4 minutes (do not boil). Mix in bacon. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Divide pasta among 6 plates. Serve, passing additional cheese separately.

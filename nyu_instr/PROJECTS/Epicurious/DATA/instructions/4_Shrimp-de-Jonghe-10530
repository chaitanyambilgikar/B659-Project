1. Add shrimp to a kettle of salted boiling water and cook until barely pink, about 2 minutes. (Shrimp will not be cooked through.) Drain shrimp and cool.
2. Preheat oven to 375°F. and butter a shallow casserole just large enough to hold shrimp in one layer.
3. In a bowl stir together butter, bread crumbs, parsley, Sherry, garlic, salt, cayenne, and paprika until blended.
4. Place shrimp in casserole and spoon bread-crumb mixture over them.
5. Bake casserole until crumbs are golden brown and sizzling, 30 to 35 minutes.
6. Serve shrimp on toast points, if desired.

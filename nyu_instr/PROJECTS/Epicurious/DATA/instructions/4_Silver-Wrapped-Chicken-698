Combine first 12 ingredients in large bowl and stir to blend. Add chicken and turn to coat. Cover and refrigerate overnight, stirring occasionally.
Place 1 foil square on work surface with 1 corner pointing toward the edge. Place 1 chicken piece in center of foil. Drizzle with 1 teaspoon marinade. Fold bottom corner over chicken. Fold sides in. Lift section of foil containing chicken and fold upward, leaving top corner of foil exposed. Fold top corner into flap. Repeat with remaining chicken and foil. Discard remaining marinade.
Pour oil into heavy large Dutch oven to depth of 6 inches. Heat to 350°F. Working in batches, carefully add chicken packages (oil will bubble vigorously) and fry until chicken is cooked through, about 8 minutes per batch. Using tongs transfer packages to paper towels and drain.
Arrange packages on platter. Serve warm.

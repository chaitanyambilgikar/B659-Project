Combine buttermilk, butter and sugar in large bowl. Sprinkle yeast over. Let stand until yeast dissolves, about 8 minutes. Mix in whole wheat flour and salt, then 2 1/2 cups all purpose flour, 1/2 cup at a time. Stir until soft dough forms. Continue adding all purpose flour 1/4 cup at a time if dough is very sticky. Mix in crystallized ginger and bulgur. Lightly flour work surface with 1/2 cup flour. Turn dough out onto work surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.
Butter large bowl; add dough and turn to coat with butter. Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Let dough rise in warm draft-free area until almost doubled in volume, about 1 1/2 hours. Butter 9x5x3-inch loaf pan. Punch dough down; turn out onto work surface. Roll dough into cylinder; press into prepared pan. Cover with damp towel. Let rise in warm draft-free area until almost doubled in volume, about 40 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375°F. Bake bread until golden, about 35 minutes. Cool 10 minutes on rack. Remove from pan; cool.
*Also called cracked wheat, bulgur is available at natural foods stores and supermarkets nationwide.

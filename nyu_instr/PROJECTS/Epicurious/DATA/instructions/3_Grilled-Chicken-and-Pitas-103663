Prepare grill for cooking.
Lightly oil pitas on both sides and season with salt and pepper. Grill pitas, in batches if necessary, on an oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals until golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Transfer to cooling racks.
Pat chicken dry and brush with remaining oil. Season with salt and pepper and grill until just cooked through, about 6 minutes on each side. Transfer chicken to a cutting board and let stand 5 minutes. Cut into slices.
Fill pitas with chicken, and if desired, salads from rest of menu.

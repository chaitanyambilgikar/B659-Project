1. Drain the artichokes, reserving the oil, and halve them lengthwise.
2. Place 3 tablespoons of the artichoke oil marinade in a heavy pot. Add the onions and stir over low heat for 10 minutes, adding the garlic during the last 2 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes, tomato paste, basil, oregano, and red-pepper flakes. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Simmer, uncovered, for 45 minutes.
3. Add the reserved artichoke hearts with the remaining oil marinade and stir while simmering for 20 minutes. Stir in the parsley and adjust the seasonings. Serve in shallow bowls over cooked penne.

Place the red currants in a medium-sized, heavy bottom pan over medium-high heat and cook until they are steaming. Stir and press on them gently so they release their juices. When most of the berries are broken (after 4 to 5 minutes) and have released their juices, remove them from the heat and put them gently through a food mill - the pulp left from the berries should still be somewhat moist, not totally dry. If you press the berries too much, the resulting jelly won't be crystal clear. Strain the juice through a fine -mesh sieve and reserve.
Place the black currants and the water in a medium-sized, heavy bottom pan over medium high heat and cook until the berries and liquid are steaming. Stir, pressing on the berries, so they release their juices. When the berries are soft and broken and have released much of their juice remove from the heat and put them gently through a food mill. If you press the berries too much, the resulting jelly won't be crystal clear.Strain the juice through a fine -mesh sieve, and reserve.
Combine the juices and the sugar in a medium, heavy bottomed saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Set the timer for exactly 3 minutes, remove from the heat and ladle the jelly into sterilized canning jars.

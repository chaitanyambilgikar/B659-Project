1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
2. Place the oats, the flour, the salt and the brown sugar in a food processor and process to blend the mixture. Add the butter and process until the ingredients are coarsely mixed.
3. Place the apples in an oval, 8 1/2 by 12-inch oven proof baking dish. Mix the cinnamon with the vanilla sugar and sprinkle it over the apples. Mound the oat mixture atop the apples, covering them as evenly as possible.
4. Bake in the oven until the topping is golden and the apples are baked through, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Remove from the oven and let cool to room temperature before eating.

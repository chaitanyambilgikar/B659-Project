Put all ingredients into a blender in the order given. Blend for half a minute. If you like a lumpy dressing, blend only half the cheese; mash the rest and add it later. If you do not use a blender, beat the oil, vinegar, salt and pepper in a bowl until thoroughly blended. Mince the garlic fine and use 1 tablespoon of grated onion. Mash the cheese with this, adding the cream. Then combine the two mixtures and beat hard. This dressing may be kept on hand in the refrigerator; it solidifies as it chills, but readily softens at room temperature.

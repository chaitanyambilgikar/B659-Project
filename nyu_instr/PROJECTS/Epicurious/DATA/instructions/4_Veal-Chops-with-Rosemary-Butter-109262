Whisk butter, 1 teaspoon rosemary, 1/4 teaspoon thyme, and pinch of salt in small bowl to blend. Wrap rosemary butter in plastic wrap, forming 1 1/2-inch-diameter log. Chill at least 2 hours. (Can be made 1 week ahead. Keep refrigerated.)
Arrange chops in single layer in large baking dish. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons olive oil. Sprinkle with remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons rosemary and 3/4 teaspoon thyme. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Rub oil and seasonings into chops. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover with plastic wrap and chill. Let stand at room temperature 1 hour before continuing.)
Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add rosemary sprig and garlic. Sauté until garlic is fragrant but not brown, about 2 minutes. Discard rosemary sprig and garlic. Increase heat to high. Add chops; cook until chops are browned and meat thermometer inserted horizontally into center reads 130°F, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer chops to plate. Pour off drippings from pan. Reduce heat to medium-high. Add wine to skillet and cook until reduced to about 2 teaspoons, scraping up browned bits, about 30 seconds. Add chicken broth; cook until reduced to about 2 tablespoons, about 30 seconds. Drizzle over chops.
Cut rosemary butter into 4 slices. Place 1 slice atop each chop and serve.

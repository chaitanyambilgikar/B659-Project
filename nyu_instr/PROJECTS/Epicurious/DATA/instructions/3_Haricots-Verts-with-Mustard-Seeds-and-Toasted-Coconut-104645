Cook beans in a 3-quart saucepan of boiling salted water until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes, then drain in a colander. Rinse under cold running water to stop cooking and drain well.
Heat 1/2 tablespoon oil in a 10-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then cook coconut, stirring, until golden, about 2 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain.
Cook mustard seeds in remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil over moderately high heat, covered, shaking skillet, until popping subsides, about 1 minute.
Add beans to skillet with salt to taste and sauté, stirring occasionally, until heated through. Serve sprinkled with coconut.

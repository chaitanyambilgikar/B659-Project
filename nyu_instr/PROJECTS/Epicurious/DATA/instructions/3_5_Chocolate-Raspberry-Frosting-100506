Stir chocolate in top of double boiler over simmering water until melted and smooth. Pour chocolate into large bowl. Cool to room temperature. Add sour cream, jam, corn syrup, framboise and vanilla to chocolate. Using electric mixer, beat until mixture is fluffy, smooth and light in color, about 3 minutes. Beat in butter. (Frosting can be prepared 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature. Whisk frosting before using.)

In a small saucepan heat water with milk just until lukewarm and remove pan from heat. Stir in sugar and yeast and let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes.
While yeast is proofing, in a bowl whisk together flour and salt and with a pastry blender or fingertips blend in lard until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add milk mixture to flour mixture and stir until a dough forms. On a lightly floured surface knead dough gently just until smooth, about 1 minute.
Transfer dough to a lightly oiled large bowl and turn to coat with oil. Let dough rise, bowl covered with plastic wrap, in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 45 minutes.
Grease 2 baking sheets.
Punch down dough and divide into 1-ounce balls (about 1 1/2 inches in diameter). Transfer balls to baking sheets and let rise, covered loosely with plastic wrap, in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375°F.
Bake splits in upper and lower thirds of oven, switching position of sheets halfway through baking, 20 minutes, or until golden, and transfer to racks to cool.
Serve splits hot or at room temperature, cut open, with jam and clotted cream.

Place noodles in large bowl. Add enough boiling water to cover noodles. Let stand until noodles are soft, about 5 minutes; drain.
Combine stock, shallots, ginger, and fish sauce in large pot. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to low, cover partially, and simmer 10 minutes. Discard ginger slices. Return stock to boil. Stir in noodles and turkey; simmer until turkey is heated through, about 3 minutes.
Ladle soup into bowls. Serve, allowing diners to top each serving with bean sprouts, mint leaves, chiles, and lime wedges to squeeze over.
To make turkey stock: Break up the carcass so that it its into a 6-quart or larger pot. Add 3 quarts water and 1 each coarsely chopped onion, carrot, and celery stalk. Bring to boil, skimming off any foam. Add 6 parsley sprigs, 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme, and 1/4 teaspoon whole peppercorns. Simmer 2 to 3 hours. Strain, then skim off any fat from surface of the broth.

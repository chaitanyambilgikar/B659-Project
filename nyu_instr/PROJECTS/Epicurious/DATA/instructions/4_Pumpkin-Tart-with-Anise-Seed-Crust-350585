Make tart shell: Prepare dough, adding anise seeds to dry ingredients, and chill as directed in dough recipe. Roll out dough into a 14-inch round on a lightly floured surface with a lightly floured rolling pin, then fit into tart pan and trim excess dough. Chill until firm, at least 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375°F with rack in middle.
Lightly prick bottom of shell with a fork, then line with foil and fill with pie weights. Bake shell until side is set and edge is pale golden, about 15 minutes.
Remove foil and weights and bake shell until golden all over, about 15 minutes more. Cool completely in pan. Leave oven on.
Fill and bake tart: Whisk together pumpkin, sugar spices, and salt in large bowl. Whisk in eggs, then cream.
Pour filling into cooled tart shell and bake until puffed about 1 1/2 inches from edge and center is just set, 40 to 45 minutes. (Cover edge of tart with foil if browning too quickly.) Cool in pan, about 2 hours. (Tart will continue to set as it cools.)

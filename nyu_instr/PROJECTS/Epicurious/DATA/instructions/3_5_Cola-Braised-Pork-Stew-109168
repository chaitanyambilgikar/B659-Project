Heat oil in large pot over high heat. Add half of pork; sauté until brown on all sides, about 8 minutes. Transfer pork to bowl. Repeat with remaining pork. Return pork to pot. Turn off heat and pour cola slowly into pot. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer 30 minutes. Add garlic, soy sauce, ginger, and half of green onions. Cover and simmer until pork is tender, about 50 minutes longer. Uncover and simmer until sauce is slightly thickened, about 10 minutes. Season stew with salt and pepper. Transfer to bowl; sprinkle with remaining green onions.

Remove crust from bread; cut each slice into thirds.
Using a pastry brush, spread each piece generously with soup. Sprinkle with cheese.
Lay each piece of bread on 1/2 slice of room temperature, uncooked bacon, roll like a jelly roll, and set on baking sheet, seam down. Use a toothpick if necessary to keep them firmly together. They may be chilled until baked.
Bake at 300 degrees about 30 minutes or until well browned.

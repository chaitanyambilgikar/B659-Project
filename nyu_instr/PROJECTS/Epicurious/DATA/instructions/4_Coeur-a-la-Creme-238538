Rinse cheesecloth under water; squeeze until just damp. Line each of four 3- to 4-inch coeur à la crème molds with 1 square of cheesecloth. Using electric mixer, beat cream cheese, crème fraîche, 4 tablespoons powdered sugar, lemon juice, vanilla, and salt in large bowl until smooth, about 4 minutes. Press through fine strainer; divide among molds. Fold cheesecloth over. Place molds in shallow baking dish; cover with plastic wrap. Chill at least 4 hours and up to 1 day.
Stir strawberries with 2 tablespoons powdered sugar; let stand 30 minutes. Unwrap molds; invert onto plates. Spoon strawberries around and serve.

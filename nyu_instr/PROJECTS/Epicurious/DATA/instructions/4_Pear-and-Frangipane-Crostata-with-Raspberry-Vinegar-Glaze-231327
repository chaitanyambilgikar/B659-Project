Finely grind almond paste in processor. Add softened butter, flour, and egg; blend until smooth.
Preheat oven to 400°F. Roll out puff pastry on floured surface to 13x11-inch rectangle. Fold 3/4 inch of edges over; press to adhere to make 11 1/2x9 1/2-inch rectangle. Transfer to rimmed baking sheet. Pierce surface evenly with fork, avoiding folded edges. Spread almond paste mixture evenly over crust within folded edges. Arrange pear slices atop filling, overlapping slightly. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon sugar. Bake until crust is deep golden and pears are tender, about 38 minutes. Cool slightly.
Meanwhile, stir vinegar and remaining 1/4 cup sugar in heavy small saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat; boil until syrup is reduced to 1/4 cup, about 6 minutes.
Place tart on platter. Drizzle syrup over. Sprinkle lightly with peppercorns and serve warm.

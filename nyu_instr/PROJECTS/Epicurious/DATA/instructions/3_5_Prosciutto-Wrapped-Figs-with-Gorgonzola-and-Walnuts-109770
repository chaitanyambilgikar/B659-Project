Preheat broiler. Cover large rimmed baking sheet with foil. Wrap each fig half with 1 prosciutto strip; place on prepared sheet. Broil until prosciutto chars slightly on edges, about 1 1/2 minutes. Turn figs; broil about 1 1/2 minutes longer, watching closely to prevent burning. Place 1/2 teaspoon Gorgonzola atop each fig half. Top each with walnut piece. Serve warm or at room temperature.

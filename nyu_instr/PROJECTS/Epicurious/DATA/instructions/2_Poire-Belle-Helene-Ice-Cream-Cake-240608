Bring water and sugar to a boil in a small heavy saucepan, stirring until sugar has dissolved. Remove from heat and stir in brandy. Reserve 1/4 cup syrup. Add chocolate to remaining syrup and stir over low heat until smooth. Cool sauce to room temperature.
Line bottom and sides of an 8 1/2- by 4 1/2-inch loaf pan with parchment, leaving a 3-inch overhang on both sides.
Cut off top and bottom crusts of cake, then cut cake in half horizontally. Spread about 1 cup ice cream in bottom of lined pan, then put 1 cake layer on top and brush cake with half of reserved syrup. Cover cake and space around it with 1 cup ice cream. Put remaining cake layer on top and brush with remaining syrup. Spread remaining ice cream over cake and into any spaces. Cover with overhang and freeze at least 3 hours.
To serve: Warm sauce over very low heat, stirring. Run a knife around edge of cake and invert onto a platter. Slice cake; serve with sauce.

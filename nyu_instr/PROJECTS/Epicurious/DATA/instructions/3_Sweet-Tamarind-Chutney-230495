Gently mash tamarind with water in a small bowl until pulp is softened. Force pulp through a sieve into a 2- to 3-quart saucepan, pressing on and then discarding seeds and thick fibers. Add sugar and cook over low heat, stirring, just until sugar is dissolved, then return mixture to cleaned bowl.
Toast coriander, cumin, and anise seeds in a small skillet over moderate heat, stirring, until fragrant and a shade darker, about 2 minutes. Cool completely, then finely grind in grinder. Stir spices into tamarind mixture along with chile powder and salt.

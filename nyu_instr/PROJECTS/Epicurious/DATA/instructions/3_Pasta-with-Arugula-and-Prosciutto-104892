Cook pasta in an 8-quart pot of boiling salted water until al dente. Reserve 1 cup cooking water, then drain pasta in a colander.
Return pasta to pot and toss with prosciutto, arugula, Parmigiano- Reggiano, zest, and salt and pepper to taste. Drizzle oil over pasta and toss to combine, adding some of reserved cooking water if pasta seems dry.

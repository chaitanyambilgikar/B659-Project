1. Place oil in a 10- or 12-inch skillet over medium heat. Add sausage and cook, breaking up clumps, until no longer pink. Add spinach, escarole and garlic. Cook, stirring, until greens are wilted, 2 to 3 minutes; reserve.
2. Place the broth and oregano in a medium-sized saucepan and bring to a boil; reserve.
3. Preheat oven to 350°F. Place pasta in the bottom of a 10- to 12-cup covered casserole. Spoon reserved sausage and greens over pasta. Scatter rice and barley over greens. Stir in reserved broth; bring to a boil. Remove from heat, cover and bake until pasta and grains are tender and most of the liquid is absorbed, about 30 minutes. Remove from oven, add parsley and stir well. Serve immediately with cheese, if desired.

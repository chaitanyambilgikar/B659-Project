Preheat oven to 350°F. Generously spray large baking sheet with nonstick spray. Place 1 egg roll wrapper on work surface. Using 2- to 2 1/4-inch-diameter cookie cutter, cut out 6 rounds from wrapper. Transfer rounds to prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining 3 egg roll wrappers, making 24 rounds total. Spray rounds with nonstick spray. Bake rounds until golden brown, turning once, about 3 minutes per side. Cool.
Increase oven temperature to 400°F. Generously spray 2 more baking sheets with nonstick spray. Combine purchased dressing, shallots, mustard, 2 teaspoons water and crushed red pepper in large bowl; stir to blend. Transfer 1 1/2 tablespoons dressing to small bowl and reserve. Place 14 ounces fresh wild mushrooms in large bowl with remaining dressing; toss to coat. Let stand 25 minutes.
Arrange half of mushroom mixture in single layer on each prepared baking sheet. Season with salt and pepper. Bake until mushrooms are golden brown, turning mushrooms over halfway through baking, about 12 minutes. Cool slightly. Coarsely chop cooked mushrooms. Return cooked mushrooms to large bowl. Add enoki mushrooms, arugula, sun-dried tomatoes and reserved 1 1/2 tablespoons dressing. Toss to coat. Season to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 8 hours ahead. Store egg roll rounds airtight at room temperature. Cover and refrigerate mushroom mixture. Bring to room temperature before serving.)
Arrange egg roll rounds on platter. Spoon mushroom mixture onto egg roll rounds and serve.

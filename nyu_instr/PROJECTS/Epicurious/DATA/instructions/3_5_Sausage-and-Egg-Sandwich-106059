Butter bread slices and arrange 2, buttered sides down, on a large plate.
Heat oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then cook patties, pressing with a spatula to flatten, until golden brown and cooked through, about 2 minutes on each side. Transfer to paper towels to drain briefly, then arrange 2 patties side by side on each plated bread slice. Top with cheese.
Fry eggs in fat remaining in skillet over moderate heat, seasoning with salt and pepper, until whites are barely set, about 1 1/2 minutes. Flip eggs with spatula and cook until whites are set and yolks are just set but still soft, 45 seconds to 1 minute more.
Carefully transfer eggs to sandwiches, topping each patty with an egg. Cover with remaining 2 bread slices, buttered sides up. Wipe out skillet.
Carefully transfer sandwiches to skillet and cook over moderate heat, turning carefully once, until golden, 2 to 4 minutes total. Halve sandwiches.

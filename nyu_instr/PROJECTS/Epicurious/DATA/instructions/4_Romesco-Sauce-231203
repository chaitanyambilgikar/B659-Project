Soak chile in boiling-hot water to cover until soft, about 15 minutes, then drain and thinly slice.
While chile soaks, roast bell pepper on rack of a gas burner over moderately high heat, turning with tongs, until skin is blackened, 7 to 10 minutes. (Or broil on a broiler pan about 2 inches from heat, turning, 8 to 10 minutes.) Transfer immediately to a bowl and cover tightly, then let stand 10 minutes. When bell pepper is cool enough to handle, peel and cut into 8 pieces, discarding stems, seeds, and ribs.
Heat oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat until hot but not smoking, then cook garlic, turning occasionally, until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Add chile, bell pepper, and broth and cook, stirring occasionally, until most of liquid is evaporated, 3 to 5 minutes.
Add tomatoes including juice, bread, and hazelnuts and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until most of liquid is evaporated, 10 to 15 minutes.
Stir in butter, then carefully transfer sauce to a food processor. Add honey, salt, and pepper and pulse to a coarse purée. Season with salt.

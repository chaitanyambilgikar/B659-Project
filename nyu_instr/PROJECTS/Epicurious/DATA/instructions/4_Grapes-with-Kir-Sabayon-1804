Using whisk or electric mixer, beat yolks, sugar and salt in medium nonaluminum metal bowl. Set bowl over saucepan of simmering water (do not let bowl touch water). Gradually beat wine. Continue beating until mixture mounds in spoon, and candy thermometer registers 160°F, about 9 minutes. Set bowl into larger bowl filled with ice and water. Whisk until cool. Remove from over water.
Beat cream in another medium bowl until stiff peaks form. Add crème de cassis and beat until peaks form again. Fold into egg mixture. Cover and refrigerate. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.)
Mix grapes in bowl. Divide among 6 bowls. Spoon sabayon over.

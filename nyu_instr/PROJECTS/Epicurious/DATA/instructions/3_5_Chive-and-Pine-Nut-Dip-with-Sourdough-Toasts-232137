Purée 3/4 cup chives with oil and 1/8 teaspoon salt in a blender until smooth, then chill 1 hour.
While chive oil stands, put oven racks in upper and lower thirds of oven and preheat oven to 375°F. Divide bread slices between 2 baking sheets and toast, switching position of sheets halfway through toasting, until golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Leave oven on.
Toast pine nuts in a shallow baking pan in lower third of oven, shaking pan occasionally, until pale golden, 4 to 5 minutes. Cool, then coarsely chop.
Pour chive oil through a fine-mesh sieve into a small bowl, pressing on and then discarding solids. Stir in pine nuts and remaining 2 tablespoons chives.
Whisk together mascarpone, cream cheese, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt in a bowl until smooth. Fold in chive oil with pine nuts until cream is streaked (do not mix in thoroughly). Transfer dip to a shallow bowl and serve with toasts.

Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally. Drain.
Meanwhile, combine tomatoes, 6 tablespoons olive oil, chopped mint, green onions, chopped cilantro, and garlic in large bowl. Season to taste with salt.
Heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add garbanzo beans and sauté until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add garbanzo beans and pasta to tomato mixture in bowl; toss to coat. Add feta; toss briefly. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Garnish with mint and cilantro sprigs. Serve warm or let stand at room temperature up to 2 hours. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Bring to room temperature before serving.)

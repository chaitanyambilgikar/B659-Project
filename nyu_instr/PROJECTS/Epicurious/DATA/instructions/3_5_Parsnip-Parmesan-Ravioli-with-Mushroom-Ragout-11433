For ravioli filling In a saucepan boil parsnips in salted water to cover by 2 inches, uncovered, until very tender, about 15 minutes. Drain parsnips well. In a food processor purée parsnips with Parmesan, sage, and salt and pepper to taste until smooth, and cool. Filling may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.
Bring a kettle of salted water to a gentle boil for ravioli.
Put 1 wrapper on a lightly floured surface and mound 1 level tablespoon filling in center. Brush edges of wrapper with water and fold wrapper in half to form a triangle, pressing around filling to force out air. Transfer ravioli to a dry kitchen towel to drain. Make more ravioli with remaining wrappers and filling in same manner, transferring to towel and turning occasionally to dry slightly.
In a saucepan heat ragout over low heat, stirring occasionally, until hot. Cook ravioli in gently boiling water in 3 batches 6 to 8 minutes, or until they rise to surface and are tender. (Do not let water boil vigorously once ravioli have been added.) With a spoon transfer ravioli as cooked to shallow baking pans, arranging in one layer, with about 1/2 inch cooking water. Keep ravioli warm, covered.
Transfer ravioli with a slotted spoon to 6 serving plates and top with ragout.

Put wine and sugar in a pan and bring to a boil. When sugar has melted and syrup is well blended, add pears and poach them gently, spooning the liquid over them. Turn pears to cook evenly. When fruit is tender and well colored, remove to a bowl to cool. Add jelly to syrup and cook and blend for several minutes. Pour syrup over pears. Let them stand and become thoroughly chilled in the liquid before serving.

1. Add all the ingredients but the crabs to a large stockpot. Cover with water (about 1 gallon) and bring to a boil.
2. Add half the crabs and turn off the heat. Let steep for 5 minutes.
3. Remove the crabs from the pot and set aside until cool enough to handle.
4. Bring the water back to a boil and repeat steps 2 and 3 with the remaining crabs.
5. Serve with boiled corn, potatoes, andouille sausage, and prawns or shrimp (if desired).

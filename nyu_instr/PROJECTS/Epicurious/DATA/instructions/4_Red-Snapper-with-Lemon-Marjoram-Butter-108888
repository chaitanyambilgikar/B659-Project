Preheat broiler. Line a shallow baking pan (1 to 1 1/2 inches deep) with foil.
Stir together butter, zest, juice, marjoram, salt, and pepper in a small bowl.
Brush both sides of each snapper fillet with oil. Arrange fillets, skin sides down, in baking pan and season with salt and pepper. Broil 4 to 6 inches from heat until cooked through, about 5 minutes. Serve immediately, topped with marjoram butter.

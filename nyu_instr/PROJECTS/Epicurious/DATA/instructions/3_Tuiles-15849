Sift the flour, sugar, and salt into a small mixing bowl. Add the egg whites and then the melted unsalted butter, and whisk until just combined. Set the batter aside to rest for 1 1/2 hours before using, or cover and refrigerate for up to 3 days.
Preheat the oven to 350°F. Heavily butter 3 pieces of parchment paper, and place one each on three baking sheets. Using 1 1/2 Tbsps. per tuile, spoon the batter onto the baking sheets, 5 per sheet. The cookies should be at least 2 inches apart, as they spread during baking. Dipping a finger in the milk first, spread each cookie into a 3-inch round. To insure even baking, make the edges no thinner than the centers.
Bake the tuiles 8 to 10 minutes, or until the edges are golden and the centers are just beginning to color. Remove the cookies from the oven. As soon as they are cool enough to handle, remove the tuiles from the baking sheets and drape them around rolling pins or wine bottles. If the cookies become too cool and stiff to bend, return them to the oven for a minute or so and they will soften up.

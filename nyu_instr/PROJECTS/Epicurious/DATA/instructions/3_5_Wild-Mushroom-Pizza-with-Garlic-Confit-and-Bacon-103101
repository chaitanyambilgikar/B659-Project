Cook bacon in large skillet over medium heat until golden, about 10 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towels. Pour off drippings from skillet. Add oil and garlic to skillet. Cover and cook over low heat until garlic is golden, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes. Add mushrooms and bell pepper; cover and cook over high heat until vegetables are tender, stirring often, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be made 8 hours ahead; chill bacon and vegetables.)
Preheat oven to 450°F. Place pizza crust on baking sheet. Sprinkle cheeses, then vegetable mixture and bacon over crust. Bake until cheeses melt, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven. Let stand 2 minutes. Cut into wedges and serve.

Purée strawberries with apple juice in a blender until smooth. Spoon equal amounts of berry sauce into 4 cocktail or parfait glasses. Combine ricotta cream ingredients in a blender or food processor. Process until mixture is smooth, about 30 seconds. Spoon 1/4 of the ricotta cream into each glass and top with 1/4 cup strawberry slices. Refrigerate until ready to serve. Garnish each with a mint sprig and an edible flower, if desired, before serving.

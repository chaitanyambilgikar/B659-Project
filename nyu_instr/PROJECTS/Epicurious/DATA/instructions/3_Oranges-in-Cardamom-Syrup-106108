Using vegetable peeler, remove 5-inch-long strip of peel from 1 navel orange; reserve. Using knife, cut off remaining peel and white pith from oranges. Cut oranges lengthwise in half, then crosswise into 1/3-inch-thick slices; place slices in bowl.
Using mortar and pestle, grind cardamom to break open pods and pulverize black seeds and husks, yielding about 1/2 teaspoon crushed cardamom. Transfer cardamom and reserved orange peel strip to heavy medium saucepan. Add 3 cups water, sugar, lemon peel, and cinnamon stick; bring to boil. Reduce heat to low; simmer until mixture is reduced to 1 cup, about 50 minutes. Cool syrup 10 minutes. Strain, discarding solids in strainer.
Pour warm syrup over oranges and chill at least 6 hours or overnight.

For Custard Using vegetable peeler, cut peel (orange part only) in wide strips from oranges. Combine milk, half and half and sugar in saucepan. Scrape seeds from vanilla bean into milk mixture; add bean. Bring to simmer, stirring until sugar dissolves. Add peel. Remove from heat. Cover and steep 30 minutes.
Strain mixture into medium bowl; cool to lukewarm. Whisk eggs and yolks in large bowl to blend. Gradually whisk milk mixture into eggs. Chill until cold.
For Caramel Mix 1 cup sugar, 1/4 cup water and juice in heavy medium saucepan. Stir over low heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat; boil without stirring until syrup turns deep amber, occasionally swirling pan and brushing down sides with wet pastry brush, about 10 minutes. Add 3 tablespoons water (mixture will bubble). Stir over low heat until hard bits dissolve. Immediately pour into 6-cup soufflé dish; swirl to coat bottom and halfway up sides. Cool.
Preheat oven to 350°F. Whisk custard; pour into caramel-coated dish. Place in large baking pan. Fill pan with enough hot water to come halfway up sides of dish. Cover pan completely with foil, sealing at edges. Bake until center 3 inches of custard moves only slightly when dish is shaken, about 1 hour. Remove from oven; let stand covered 10 minutes. Remove from water; chill overnight.

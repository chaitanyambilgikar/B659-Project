Mix first 10 ingredients in medium bowl. Let stand 1 hour at room temperature.
Preheat oven to 400°F. Press each fillet into coriander seeds to coat all sides. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in large skillet over high heat. Add 3 fillets and sear until brown, about 1 minute per side. Transfer to large rimmed baking sheet. Repeat with remaining 3 fillets and 1 tablespoon oil. Spoon 1 tablespoon sauce over each fillet. Bake until just cooked through, about 5 minutes for medium-rare. Transfer fish to plates.
Toss Stir-fried Vegetables with 2 tablespoons sauce. Divide vegetables among plates. Serve, passing remaining sauce separately.

Put oven racks in upper and lower thirds of oven and preheat oven to 425°F. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment.
Pulse flour, baking powder, salt, nutmeg, butter, and 1/4 cup sugar in a food processor until mixture resembles coarse meal. Transfer to a large bowl and stir in raisins and walnuts. Add cream and half-and-half and stir until just combined.
Drop 4 mounds of batter (about 1/2 cup each) onto each sheet, leaving 1/2 to 2 inches between mounds.
Stir together remaining 1/4 cup sugar and orange zest and sprinkle over tops of mounds.
Bake biscuits, switching position of sheets halfway through baking, until puffed and golden, 20 to 25 minutes total. Transfer to a rack and cool to warm, about 10 minutes.

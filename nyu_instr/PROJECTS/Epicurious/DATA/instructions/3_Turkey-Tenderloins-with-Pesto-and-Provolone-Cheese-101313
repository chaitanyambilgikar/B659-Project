Preheat oven to 375°F. Cut each tenderloin lengthwise almost in half. Sprinkle inside and out with salt and pepper. Spread 1 tablespoon pesto inside each. Then insert cheese strips, dividing equally. Using toothpicks, skewer tenderloins closed. Brush each all over with 1 tablespoon pesto. Arrange tenderloins on rimmed baking sheet.
Bake tenderloins until thermometer inserted near center registers 160°F., about 20 minutes. Slice tenderloins crosswise into 3/4-inch-thick rounds; arrange on serving platter. Whisk any juices and browned bits on baking sheet to blend; spoon over turkey. Garnish with basil sprigs, if desired, and serve.

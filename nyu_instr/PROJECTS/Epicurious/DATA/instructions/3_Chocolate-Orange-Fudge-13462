Butter an 8-inch square glass baking dish.
In a heavy 2-quart saucepan combine sugar, chocolate, cream, and salt and cook over moderate heat, stirring constantly, until sugar is dissolved and chocolate is melted. Cook mixture, without stirring, until a candy thermometer registers 238°F. Remove pan from heat and add butter and orange peel, swirling pan without stirring. Cool fudge 5 minutes and beat with a wooden spoon until it just begins to lose its gloss (do not overbeat or fudge will seize). Pour fudge immediately into baking dish and cool 15 minutes, or until it begins to harden. Cut fudge into 1-inch squares and cool completely. Fudge may be kept, in layers separated by wax paper in an airtight container lined with wax paper, in a cool dry place 2 weeks.
Garnish fudge with candied orange peel slices.

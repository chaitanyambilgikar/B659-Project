Whisk together lime juice, vinegar, sugar, sesame oil, chile paste, and 1/4 teaspoon salt.
Cut squid bodies open to make flat pieces and, holding knife almost parallel to work surface (at a 30-degree angle), score inner side of flattened squid in a crosshatch pattern (do not cut all the way through). Pat squid bodies and tentacles dry and toss with vegetable oil, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and pepper.
Heat lightly oiled grill pan over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then grill squid bodies, in batches if necessary, crosshatch sides down first, turning once, until just cooked through (squid will curl up as it cooks), about 2 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board as grilled and keep warm, covered. Grill tentacles in same manner. Cut squid bodies crosswise into 1-inch pieces.
Grill plums, in batches if necessary, turning once, until grill marks appear, about 2 minutes. Transfer as grilled to a bowl.
Toss cabbage with cilantro, mint, scallion, 1/4 cup peanuts, half of dressing, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt. Mound salad on plates and top with squid and plums. Drizzle with dressing to taste and sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup peanuts.

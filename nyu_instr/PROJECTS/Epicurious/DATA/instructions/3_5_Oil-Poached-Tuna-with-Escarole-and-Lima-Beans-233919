Line heavy medium skillet with lemon slices. Sprinkle tuna with salt and pepper and place atop lemon. Add just enough olive oil to cover tuna. Poach tuna over medium-low heat until almost cooked through, about 3 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer tuna to plate. Discard lemon slices.
Discard all but 1 tablespoon drippings from skillet. Add green onion and sauté over medium-high heat 1 minute. Add escarole, lima beans, and 3 tablespoons parsley to skillet. Sauté until escarole begins to wilt, about 1 minute. Sprinkle with vinegar. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Divide escarole-bean mixture between 2 plates and top with tuna slices. Sprinkle with remaining 1 tablespoon parsley and serve.

Make the dressing: In a small bowl whisk together the vinegar, the mustard, the anchovy paste, the thyme, the sugar, and salt and pepper to taste, add the oil in a stream, whisking, and whisk the dressing until it is emulsified.
Reserve 2 tablespoons of the dressing in another small bowl, arrange the tuna pieces and the squash slices on a baking sheet, and brush them lightly with the reserved dressing. In a bowl toss the shrimp and the scallops with 2 tablespoons of the remaining dressing. Let the mixture stand for 15 minutes. In a kettle of boiling water cook the beans for 5 minutes, or until they are crisp-tender, drain them in a colander, and refresh them under cold water. In another bowl toss the beans with 3 tablespoons of the remaining dressing.
On a rack set 4 to 6 inches over glowing coals grill the tuna for 2 1/2 minutes on each side, the shrimp for 4 minutes on each side, and the scallops and the squash for 6 minutes on each side, transferring the seafood and the squash as it is cooked to a platter. Line 6 plates with the lettuce, on each plate arrange 2 scallops, halved horizontally, 3 shrimp halves, and 1 piece of tuna, sliced diagonally, and divide the squash, beans, roasted pepper, tomatoes, and olives among the plates. Drizzle the remaining dressing over the salads or serve it separately.

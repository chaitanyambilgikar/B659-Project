Put fish in a shallow baking dish, pour milk over it, and chill, covered, turning over once, 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, stir together pistachios and cornmeal in a shallow bowl.
Remove fish from milk, letting excess drip off. Transfer to a plate and sprinkle all over with salt and pepper, then dredge lightly in cornmeal-pistachio mixture. Transfer to a clean plate as coated.
Heat oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then sauté fish, turning over once, until golden and just cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes total.
While fish cooks, stir together all ingredients for spicy yogurt.
Serve fish with spicy yogurt on the side.

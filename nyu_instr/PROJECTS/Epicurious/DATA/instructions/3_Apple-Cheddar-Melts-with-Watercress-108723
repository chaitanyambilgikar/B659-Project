Makes 2 servings.
Preheat broiler.
Arrange toasts in 1 layer in a shallow baking pan. Mash together butter and curry powder and spread on toasts. Arrange apple on toasts, then top with watercress and cover evenly with cheese. (Tuck watercress under cheese to prevent it from burning.)
Broil sandwiches about 6 inches from heat until cheese is melted and lightly browned, 3 to 5 minutes.

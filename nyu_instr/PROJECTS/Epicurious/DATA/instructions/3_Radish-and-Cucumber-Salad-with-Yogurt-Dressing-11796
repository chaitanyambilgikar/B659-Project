In a cheesecloth-lined sieve set over a bowl let the yogurt drain for 2 hours. In a bowl stir together the drained yogurt, the radishes, the cucumber, the garlic paste, the mint or parsley, and salt and pepper to taste. Divide the salad among individual salad plates lined with the lettuce or serve it as a sandwich filling for the pita bread.

Trim roots from scallions, leaving ends intact, and remove any bruised outer leaves. Trim greens, leaving a 9-inch length of white and green parts.
Cook scallions in a deep 12-inch skillet of boiling salted water until just tender, 4 to 5 minutes.
While scallions are cooking, stir together butter, zest, parsley, salt, and pepper.
Drain scallions in a colander, then arrange in a shallow serving dish and gently brush with lemon parsley butter.

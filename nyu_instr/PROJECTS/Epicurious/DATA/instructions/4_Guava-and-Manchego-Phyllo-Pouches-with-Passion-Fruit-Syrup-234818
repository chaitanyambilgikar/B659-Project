Toss first 4 ingredients in medium bowl to combine. Cover filling and chill until ready to use, up to 1 day.
Stir sugar, cinnamon, and cayenne pepper in small bowl. Place 1 phyllo sheet on work surface; keep remaining sheets covered with plastic wrap and damp towel to prevent drying. Brush phyllo with butter and sprinkle with 11/2 teaspoons sugar mixture. Repeat 2 more times to make 3 layers. Cut rectangle in half crosswise, making two 6x8-inch stacks. Place scant 1/3 cup guava filling in center of each stack. Gather sheets around filling to form pouch. Brush pouches with butter. Transfer to small baking sheet. Repeat with remaining ingredients to make 6 pouches total. Sprinkle with some of remaining sugar mixture. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover with plastic and refrigerate.)
Preheat oven to 350°F. Bake phyllo pouches uncovered until golden brown and filling is heated through, about 20 minutes. Transfer to plates. Spoon syrup alongside; serve phyllo pouches warm.

Simmer chuck in broth in a 2-quart saucepan, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until meat is very tender, about 1 hour.
While meat simmers, break up tomatoes by squeezing them into a bowl with purée. Cook onion in half of butter in a 4-quart saucepan over moderate heat, stirring, until softened. Add tomatoes with purée, Worcestershire sauce, and sugar, then simmer, stirring occasionally,15 minutes, or until slightly thickened.
Preheat oven to 400°F.
To make topping, toss together bread crumbs, 1 cup Cheddar, remaining melted butter, and salt and pepper to taste.
Cook macaroni in boiling salted water until al dente, then drain in a colander. Cool macaroni 3 minutes, then transfer to a large bowl. Toss with tomato sauce, beef with broth, remaining 3 cups cheese, and salt and pepper to taste.
Transfer macaroni mixture to a buttered 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass baking dish and spoon topping evenly over. Bake in middle of oven, uncovered, 25 minutes, or until topping is golden brown and mixture is bubbling.

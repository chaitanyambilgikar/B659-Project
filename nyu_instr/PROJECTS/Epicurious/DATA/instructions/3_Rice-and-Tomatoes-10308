In a large saucepan bring 4 quarts water to a boil with the salt. Sprinkle in the rice, stirring until the water returns to a boil, and boil it for 10 minutes. Drain the rice in a colander and rinse it. Set the colander over a large saucepan of boiling water and steam the rice, covered with a kitchen towel and the lid, for 15 minutes, or until it is fluffy and dry. The rice may be made 1 day in advance and kept covered and chilled. Reheat the rice in a steamer over boiling water. In a saucepan cook the onion in the oil over moderately low heat, stirring occasionally, until it is softened, add the tomatoes with the reserved juice, and cook the mixture, stirring occasionally, for 3 minutes. In a bowl combine well the rice, the tomato mixture, and salt and pepper to taste.

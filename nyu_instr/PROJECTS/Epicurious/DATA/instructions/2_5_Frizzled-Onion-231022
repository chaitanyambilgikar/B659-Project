Very thinly slice onion lengthwise with slicer.
Heat 2 inches oil in a 2-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat until thermometer registers 340°F, then fry onion in 6 batches, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes per batch (watch closely; onion can burn easily). Quickly transfer each batch with a slotted spoon to fresh paper towels to drain, then sprinkle lightly with salt. (Onion will crisp as it cools.) Return oil to 340°F between batches.

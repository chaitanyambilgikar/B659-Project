To make tart: 1. Preheat the oven to 350°F.
2. Place the dates in a small bowl, pour 1 cup boiling water over them, then add the baking soda. Let dates stand for 10 minutes, or until soft.
3. In the bowl of an electric mixer with the beaters attached, combine the butter and sugar, and beat until creamy. Beat in the egg. Sift in the flour, salt, and baking powder. Add the date mixture, including the water, and the pecans. Mix well.
4. Line a lightly oiled or buttered 9-inch aluminum pie plate with parchment paper. (Alternatively, use a 9-inch springform pan.) Pour the date and nut mixture into the prepared plate and bake for 45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted at the center comes out dry. To serve (see Note), remove from the pie plate, discard the parchment paper, allow to cool slightly, cut into wedges, and top with Brandy Sauce and whipped cream.
To make brandy sauce: Combine the sugar with 1/4 cup cold water in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil and continue to boil, stirring frequently, until the sugar is dissolved, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter and vanilla, followed by the brandy.
NOTE To store the tart, if made in advance: First, allow it to cool to room temperature. Then place it in a plastic freezer bag, expel the air, seal the bag, and place it in the freezer for up to one month. To reheat the tart, place it in a 250°F oven until warm, about 45 minutes.

Combine vermouth, shallots, juniper berries, and peppercorns in heavy small saucepan. Boil until liquid is reduced to 1/4 cup, about 12 minutes. Add clam juice and boil until reduced by half, about 8 minutes. Add cream and boil until mixture is reduced to 3/4 cup, about 8 minutes. Add butter 1 tablespoon at a time, whisking until melted before adding more. Strain sauce through fine-meshed strainer. Return sauce to saucepan. (Can be made 2 hours ahead. Keep at room temperature.)
Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle salmon with parsley, then salt and pepper. Add salmon to skillet and sauté until just cooked through, about 4 minutes per side.
Meanwhile, rewarm sauce. Stir in olives, gin, and lemon juice. Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper. Place salmon on plates. Drizzle sauce over. Garnish with chives and serve.
*Juniper berries are available in the spice section of most supermarkets.

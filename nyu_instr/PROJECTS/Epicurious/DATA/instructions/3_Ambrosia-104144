Peel the oranges, taking care to remove all the white pith. Slice the oranges over a bowl or storage container so that you catch any juice, and add the slices to the bowl. Circular slices look prettiest, hold together best, and are easiest.
Add the pineapple and coconut to the orange slices and gently toss. The ambrosia can be refrigerated up to two days, covered.
When ready to serve, slice the banana and toss it with other fruits. Add the cherries last.
Serve the ambrosia in your prettiest glass bowl. It will become a tradition.

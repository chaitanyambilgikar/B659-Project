For Filling: Preheat oven to 350°F. Roll out tart crust dough on lightly floured work surface to 13x10-inch rectangle. Transfer to 11x8-inch rectangular tart pan with removable bottom, pressing dough firmly into place. Fold overhang in and press, forming double-thick sides. Freeze crust 15 minutes.
Line crust with foil. Fill with dried beans or pie weights. Bake until sides are set, about 15 minutes. Remove foil and beans. Bake until crust is golden brown and baked through, piercing with fork if crust bubbles, about 15 minutes. Transfer pan to rack and cool crust.
Combine preserves and 2 tablespoons water in heavy saucepan. Stir over low heat until preserves melt. Strain in medium bowl, pressing firmly on solids to extract liquid. Discard any solids in strainer.
Combine cream, butter and 1/4 cup preserve mixture in heavy medium saucepan. Stir over low heat until butter melts. Add chocolate and stir until chocolate melts and mixture is smooth. Remove form heat. Cool 15 minutes.
Spread chocolate mixture evenly into crust, Refrigerate until almost set, about 20 minutes.
Arrange cherries decoratively over chocolate, pressing slightly to adhere. Rewarm remaining preserve mixture over low heat. Brush generously over cherries. Chill until chocolate sets, about 1 hour. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Keep chilled.)
For Crust: Mix flour, powdered sugar and salt in processor. Add butter; process until mixture resembles coarse meal. Mix egg yolks and water in small bowl. Add to flour mixture and process until moist clumps form.
Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk for round tart or into square for rectangular tart. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate 1 hour. (Can be prepared 3 days ahead. Keep refrigerated. Let dough soften briefly at room temperature before rolling out.)
Garnish tart with mint and serve.

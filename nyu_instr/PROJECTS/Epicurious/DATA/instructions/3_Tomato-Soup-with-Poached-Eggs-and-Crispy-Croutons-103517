1. Heat the oil in a large, wide, heavy saucepan over medium heat. When the oil is hot enough to sizzle a bread cube, add all the bread cubes and saute until golden, about 3 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer to a medium bowl. Sprinkle with salt and a grinding of pepper and set aside.
2. Discard the oil in the pan and wipe the pan dry with a paper towel. Add the bacon to the pan and cook, stirring, over medium heat for 2 minutes. Add the onion, reduce the heat to medium-low and saute until golden, about 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic and red pepper flakes and saute for 1 minute more.
3. Place a food mill over the saucepan and puree th etomatoes and their juices directly into the pan. (Or, if you do not have a good mill, puree in a food processor and press through a strainer, using a rubber spatula; discard the solids.) Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the liquid is slightly reduced, about 20 minutes. Season to taste. (The soup can be made up to 1 day ahead.)
4. Just before serving, break the eggs one at a time into a cup and slip them into the simmering soup, distributing them evenly. Cover and cook until the whites are setand the yolks are cooked to the desired doneness, 8 to 10 minutes.
5. Distribute the croutons among four soup bowls. Carefully ladle the eggs into the bowls, then ladle the soup on top. Top each serving with some of the parsley and cheese and serve.

Melt butter in heavy medium skillet over high heat. Add garlic, rosemary and cayenne pepper and stir 30 seconds. Add wine and Worcestershire sauce and boil until liquid is reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Add shrimp to sauce. Simmer until shrimp are just opaque in center, about 3 minutes for peeled or 5 minutes for unpeeled. Serve shrimp with toast.

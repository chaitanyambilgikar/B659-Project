Cookies: Position a rack in the upper third of the oven and preheat to 350°F. Line 2 baking sheets with foil and coat lightly with cooking spray. In a mixing bowl, combine sugar, butter and oil, beating with an electric mixer until smooth. Add egg and vanilla; beat until creamy and light yellow. Mix together flour, baking powder, and salt and sift into sugar mixture; beat at low speed until just combined. Press the ball of dough into a disk; cover with plastic wrap. Place dough in freezer 10 minutes. Roll out dough to an even 1/4-inch thickness. Cut out cookies with 2- to 2 1/2-inch cookie cutters. Place cookies about 1/2 inch apart on prepared baking sheets. Bake cookies in upper third of oven, one sheet at a time, for 6 to 8 minutes or until slightly golden on the edges (do not overbake; cookies will appear soft when you remove them from oven). Use the tip of a knife or wooden skewer to make a hole on the top of each cookie to accommodate a ribbon or string. Cool on baking sheets for 10 minutes, then transfer to wire racks. Frost and decorate as desired.
Icing: Combine all the ingredients with 3 tbsp water in a bowl and whisk until smooth (the icing should be thick enough so it doesn't run off cookies). Tint with liquid food coloring if desired. Use a paintbrush or small knife to paint icing on cookies. Let cookies dry overnight. Thread with ribbon or string if desired.

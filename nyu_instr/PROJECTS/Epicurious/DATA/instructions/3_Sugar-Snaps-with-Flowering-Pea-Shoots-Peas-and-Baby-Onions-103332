Boil pearl onions in salted water 15 minutes and drain in a colander. Rinse under cold water, then peel.
Cook scallions and sugar snaps in a large pot of boiling salted water 1 minute. Add shelled peas and pearl onions and cook 1 minute more, or until all vegetables are crisp-tender. Drain vegetables and toss with pea shoots, butter, and salt and pepper to taste in a large bowl.

Toast bread; arrange on plates. Pat 1/4 teaspoon pepper onto each side of each steak; sprinkle steaks lightly with salt. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add steaks and sauté to desired doneness, about 4 minutes per side for medium-rare. Place 1 steak on each toast; pour any pan juices over.
Meanwhile, melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter in another medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and sauté until soft and golden, about 8 minutes. Add beer and half of thyme. Boil until liquid thickens, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
Spoon onion mixture over steaks. Sprinkle with remaining thyme.

Fry bacon in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat until just beginning to brown, about 7 minutes. Add onion, celery, garlic, bay leaf and thyme and cook until onion is tender, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes. Add stewed tomatoes with their juices, clam juice, tomato sauce, potato and chilies. Reduce heat and simmer until potato is very tender, about 40 minutes. Add clams with juices and heat through. Season chowder to taste with salt and pepper. Ladle into bowls and serve.

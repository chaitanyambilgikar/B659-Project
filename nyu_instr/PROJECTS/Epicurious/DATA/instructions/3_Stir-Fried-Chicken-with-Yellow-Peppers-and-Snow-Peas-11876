In a bowl stir together 1 teaspoon of the cornstarch, 1 1/2 teaspoons of the soy sauce, 2 teaspoons of the vinegar, 1/2 teaspoon of the sesame oil, and 1 tablespoon of the water until the cornstarch is dissolved, add the chicken, and let it marinate for 15 minutes. In a small bowl stir together the remaining 1 tablespoon cornstarch, 2 tablespoons soy sauce, 2 tablespoons vinegar, 1 teaspoon sesame oil, and 1/3 cup water with the sugar, the salt, and the broth until the cornstarch is dissolved and reserve the mixture. In a wok or large heavy skillet heat the vegetable oil over moderately high heat until it is hot but not smoking, in it stir-fry the chicken mixture until the chicken is opaque and just cooked through, and transfer the chicken with a slotted spoon to a sieve set over a bowl. Discard all but about 2 tablespoons of the oil remaining in the wok and in it stir-fry the scallion, the garlic, and the gingerroot for 10 seconds, or until the mixture is fragrant. Add the bell pepper and the snow peas and stir-fry mixture for 1 minute. Add the reserved broth mixture and the chicken and stir-fry the mixture for 1 minute, or until the chicken is heated through. Serve the chicken stir-fry over the rice.

Make cake Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter 17- by 12-inch rimmed baking sheet. Line bottom with parchment paper.
In large bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, allspice, ginger, cloves, nutmeg, and salt. Set aside.
In bowl of electric mixer, combine brown and granulated sugars, oil, and pumpkin. Beat at medium speed until fully combined, about 1 to 2 minutes. Reduce speed to low and gradually add flour mixture. Beat until combined, scraping down sides of bowl occasionally. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.
Spread batter evenly in prepared pan and bake until toothpick inserted into center comes out clean, about 25 to 30 minutes. Transfer cake to rack and cool completely in pan.
Preheat oven to 350°F. Run knife around pan sides to loosen, then turn cake out onto rack (do not clean pan) and remove parchment paper. Using long, serrated knife, cut cake into 1/2-inch cubes. Return cubes to pan and bake, turning over halfway through baking, until light brown on all sides, about 15 minutes total. Transfer cubes to rack and cool completely in pan.
Make puddings Preheat oven to 325°F.
Divide toasted cubes among 8 (4-ounce) ramekins. In medium bowl, whisk together pumpkin, milk, salt, maple syrup, and egg yolks. Pour mixture over cake cubes, filling ramekins to tops and gently pressing on cubes to completely coat with liquid. Cover and refrigerate until liquid is absorbed, about 30 minutes.
Arrange ramekins in roasting pan. Add enough hot water to pan to reach halfway up sides of ramekins. Cover pan tightly with foil and bake until puddings are set and firm to the touch, about 30 to 35 minutes.
Remove ramekins from pan and serve warm with vanilla ice cream, if desired.

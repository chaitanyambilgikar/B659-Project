Squeeze seeds and pulp from 3 pound ripe halved tomatoes into a strainer set over a large bowl. Press solids to release as much liquid as possible; discard solids. Core and chop tomatoes; add to bowl.
Combine 3 toasted, chopped 4x4x1/2" slices white sandwich bread, 1/4 cup toasted slivered almonds, and 4 smashed garlic cloves in a blender. Pulse until chopped. Add tomatoes with liquid to blender in batches, puréeing until very smooth. Add 1 teaspoon Sherry vinegar. With blender running, gradually add 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil. Purée until emulsified and frothy, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and more vinegar, if desired. Chill until cold, about 2 hours. Season to taste again with salt and vinegar.
Divide soup among small bowls or glasses. Garnish with thinly sliced Serrano ham or prosciutto and chopped hard-boiled egg. Drizzle with more oil.

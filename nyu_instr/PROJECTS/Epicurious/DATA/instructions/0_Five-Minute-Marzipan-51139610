1. If using a stand mixer: Combine the almond paste, confectioners' sugar, and 1 tablespoon of the brandy in the mixing bowl. Mix on low speed until everything is completely incorporated and the dough is smooth and pliable, about 5 minutes.
If using your hands: Form the almond paste into a flat round on your work surface. Dust half of the confectioners' sugar over the round and begin kneading it into the paste, folding the paste over on itself repeatedly. Drizzle 1 tablespoon of the brandy over the dough and knead it in. Once it's incorporated, dust the remainder of the sugar over the dough and knead until it's completely incorporated.
2. The dough should be uniform and pliable. If it's dry, add a few more drops of flavoring (or warm water) and knead until it's at the desired consistency; if it's sticky, a little more confectioners' sugar.
Store marzipan, wrapped very well in plastic wrap, in the refrigerator for at least 3 months.

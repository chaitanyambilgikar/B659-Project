Preheat oven to 400°F. Butter 11 x 7 x 2-inch glass baking dish. Blend 3/4 cup flour, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 3/4 teaspoon cardamom, 1/2 teaspoon ginger, and salt in processor. Add almond paste and process until fine crumbs form. Add butter and process using on/off turns until mixture begins to clump together. Transfer to bowl. Mix in almonds.
Toss nectarine wedges, apricot preserves, remaining 1 tablespoon flour, 1/4 cup sugar, 1/2 teaspoon cardamom, and 1/2 teaspoon ginger in large bowl to coat. Transfer to prepared baking dish; sprinkle topping over. Bake until topping is golden, nectarines are tender, and juices are bubbling around edges, about 40 minutes. Cool at least 20 minutes before serving.

Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 400°F. Put nonstick liner on a baking sheet.
Grind together sugar and zest in a food processor 1 minute. Add butter and blend until combined well, then add egg white, vanilla, and a pinch of salt and blend until incorporated. Add flour and pulse until just combined.
Spoon 1/2 teaspoon batter in a 5-inch line at one end of nonstick liner, then spread into a strip (about 3/4 inch wide and 5 inches long) with offset spatula. Make 3 more strips on same liner and bake until golden all over, 5 to 7 minutes. Cool strips on baking sheet 30 seconds (to facilitate removal), then carefully remove 1 strip with cleaned spatula and invert onto a work surface. Working quickly, wrap strip twice in a spiral around handle of a wooden spoon and transfer (still wrapped around handle) to a rack to cool and harden, about 1 minute. Repeat with remaining strips. (If strips become too brittle to work with, return to oven a few seconds to soften.) When cool and hard, remove wooden spoons and transfer tuiles to a tray. Make more tuiles in same manner, cooling and cleaning nonstick liner and spatula between batches.

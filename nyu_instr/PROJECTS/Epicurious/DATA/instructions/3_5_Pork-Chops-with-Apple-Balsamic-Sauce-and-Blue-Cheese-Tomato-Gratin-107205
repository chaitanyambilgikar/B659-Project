Cook garlic and shallot in 1 tablespoon oil in a 3-quart heavy saucepan over low heat, stirring occasionally, until softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Add wine and vinegar and boil until reduced to about 1/2 cup, 8 to 10 minutes. Add chicken and veal stocks and boil until reduced to about 1 1/3 cups, 15 to 20 minutes.
Preheat oven to 400°F.
Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking. While oil is heating, pat pork chops dry and season with salt and pepper. Sear 3 chops, turning over once, 4 minutes total, then transfer to a shallow baking pan. Sear remaining chops in same manner, then transfer to baking pan (reserving fat in skillet). Roast in middle of oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted horizontally into center of chops (do not touch bone) registers 155°F, 8 to 12 minutes.
While pork is roasting, peel apple and cut into 1/3-inch dice. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon fat from skillet, then cook apple and raisins over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until apple is golden brown and caramelized but not falling apart, 2 to 3 minutes. Add sauce and simmer, stirring, 1 minute. Season with salt and pepper.
Spoon sauce over pork chops.

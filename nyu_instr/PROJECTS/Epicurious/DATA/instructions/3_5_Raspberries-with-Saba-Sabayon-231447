Whisk egg yolks, sugar, saba, and 2 tablespoons water to blend in top of double boiler over barely simmering water (do not allow upper pot to touch water); whisk constantly until mixture thickens and thermometer registers 160°F, about 4 minutes. Place top of double boiler over large bowl filled with ice; continue whisking until mixture cools, about 3 minutes. Whip cream in small bowl until soft peaks form; fold into saba mixture. Cover sabayon with plastic wrap and refrigerate until cold, at least 1 hour and up to 4 hours.
Divide raspberries among dessert coupes. Spoon sabayon over and serve.

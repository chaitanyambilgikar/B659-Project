1. Position the rack in the lowest part of the oven and preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Brush six 3/4-cup ovenproof soufflé dishes with melted butter and invert the dishes to allow excess butter to drip out. Then, pour a little granulated sugar into each dish, turning to coat all sides, tapping out any excess sugar (see page 112). For easier handling, arrange the dishes on a flat baking tray and set aside.
2. In a small heatproof bowl placed over a pan of simmering water, melt the chocolate. When almost melted, turn off the heat and let the chocolate melt completely, stirring occasionally.
3. Meanwhile, in the large bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle or beaters, on high speed beat together the egg yolks, 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons of the sugar, and the vanilla until pale yellow and thick. Scrape the melted chocolate into the yolks and continue to beat until well combined.
4. In another clean large bowl, with whip or clean beaters, whip the 5 egg whites. Start on medium speed and raise the speed as peaks begin to form. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar and continue to whip until the whites are shiny and firm, but not stiff. (When the bowl is tipped slightly, the whites should stay in place.) Stir one-third of the whites into the chocolate mixture to lighten, then turn the chocolate back into the whites and fold until completely incorporated. Do not overmix.
5. Using a large spoon, spoon the soufflé batter into the prepared dishes, filling to the top of each dish. Bake 10 minutes; the tops will be slightly crusty and the inside creamy.
6. To serve, carefully remove each soufflé and place on a small doily-lined plate. Dust with sifted confectioner's sugar and serve with softly whipped cream or Drambouie-Flavored Crème Anglaise. Serve immediately.

Using small sharp knife, cut between membranes of orange half to release segments. Set segments aside.
Combine white wine and next 6 ingredients in large nonreactive* saucepan. Cover and simmer 15 minutes. Strain mixture; discard solids.
Return liquid to saucepan. Add cranberries, pears, figs, raisins and ginger. Cover and simmer until fruit is tender, about 10 minutes. Add apples. Simmer until apples are just tender, about 15 minutes. Cool to lukewarm. Stir in reserved orange segments. Transfer to bowl. Cover and refrigerate. (Can be prepared 1 week ahead. Keep refrigerated.)

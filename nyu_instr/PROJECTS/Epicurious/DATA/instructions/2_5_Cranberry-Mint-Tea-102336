Combine 4 cups water and cranberries in heavy medium saucepan and bring to boil. When cranberries begin to pop, reduce heat to low, cover and simmer mixture until cranberries are very tender, about 10 minutes.
Place 1 cup mint leaves in heat-proof pitcher or coffeepot. Set fine strainer atop pitcher. Pour cranberry mixture into strainer, pressing on solids to extract as much juice as possible; discard solids. Add 1/2 cup sugar to pitcher; stir until sugar has dissolved.
Refrigerate mixture until cold. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Keep chilled.) Garnish with mint sprigs and serve.

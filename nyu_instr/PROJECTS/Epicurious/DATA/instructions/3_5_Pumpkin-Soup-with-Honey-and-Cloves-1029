Melt butter in Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add carrots, celery and onion; sauté until tender, about 8 minutes. Add pumpkin, 6 cups stock and cloves. Cover and simmer until pumpkin is very tender, about 25 minutes.
Discard cloves. Purée soup in batches in blender. Return to Dutch oven. Stir in cream and honey. Bring to simmer. Season to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Chill. Bring to simmer before serving, thinning with more stock, if desired.)

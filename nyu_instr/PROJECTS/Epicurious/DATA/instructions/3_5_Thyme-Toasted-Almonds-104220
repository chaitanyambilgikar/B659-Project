1. Heat the oven to 400°F. In a large, shallow bowl, combine thyme, salt, and oil. Set aside.
2. Place the almonds in a single layer on a baking sheet. Place the baking sheet in the center of the oven and toast until the nuts are lightly browned, fragrant, and making crackling sounds, about 8 minutes.
3. Remove the baking sheet from the oven. Immediately add the hot nuts to the thyme mixture. Stir for at least 1 minute to coat the almonds evenly and thoroughly. Taste and adjust for seasoning. Serve warm or at room temperature. The almonds can be stored, well-sealed, for up to two weeks. To refresh, reheat in a hot oven.

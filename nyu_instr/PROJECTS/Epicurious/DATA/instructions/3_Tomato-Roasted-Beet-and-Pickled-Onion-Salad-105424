Preheat oven to 425°F.
Wrap beets tightly in foil to make 2 packages and roast in middle of oven until tender, about 1 1/4hours.
While beets roast, simmer vinegar, water, sugar, and spices, stirring occasionally, 15 minutes. Add onions and simmer, stirring, 2 minutes. Pour pickled onions with liquid and spices into a bowl and cool, stirring occasionally, to room temperature.
Unwrap beets and, when just cool enough to handle, slip off skins and remove stems. Cut beets into 1/2-inch-thick wedges and transfer to a serving bowl with tomatoes. Drain pickled onions in a sieve set over another bowl and discard allspice. Add onions (with remaining spices) and 2 tablespoons pickling liquid to beets and toss well. Season with salt and pepper.

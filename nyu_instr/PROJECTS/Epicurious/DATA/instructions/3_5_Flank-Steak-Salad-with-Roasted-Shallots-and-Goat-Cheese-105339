Blend oil, vinegar, thyme, and garlic in blender until garlic is chopped; season dressing with salt and pepper. Place steak in 13x9x2-inch glass baking dish. Add 1/3 cup dressing; turn to coat. Cover and chill 30 minutes. (Can be made 4 hours ahead; chill steak and dressing. Bring dressing to room temperature before using.)
Meanwhile, preheat oven to 450°F. Toss shallots and 2 tablespoons dressing on baking sheet to coat. Roast shallots until caramelized and tender, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes; set aside.
Preheat broiler. With marinade still clinging to steak, broil steak to desired doneness, about 4 minutes per side for medium-rare. Let steak rest 5 minutes; slice thinly across grain on diagonal.
Place greens and shallots in large bowl; toss with enough dressing to coat. Mound greens on large platter. Surround with steak; sprinkle with goat cheese. Serve, passing remaining dressing.

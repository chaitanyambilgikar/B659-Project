In a heavy skillet cook nuts in butter over moderate heat, stirring, 2 minutes. In a small bowl stir together sugars, cayenne, black pepper, and salt and sprinkle mixture over nuts. Continue to cook nuts, stirring constantly, until sugar carmelizes, about 8 minutes. Transfer nuts to a sheet of foil and cool. Break nuts apart. Nuts may be made 3 days ahead and kept in an airtight container.

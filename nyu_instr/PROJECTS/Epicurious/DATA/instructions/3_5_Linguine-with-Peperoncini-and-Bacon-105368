Add onion and garlic to drippings. Sauté over medium-high heat until onion begins to soften, about 4 minutes. Add peperoncini and stir 1 minute. Add tomatoes with juices and bacon. Simmer sauce 2 minutes to blend flavors. Season sauce with salt and pepper. Reduce heat to medium-low. Add linguine; toss until pasta is coated with sauce.

Build a medium-hot fire in a charcoal grill, or heat a gas grill to high. If using shell-on shrimp, use small scissors to cut shells along the curved backs. Remove veins, keeping shells intact. Place shrimp and lobster in a large bowl; drizzle with 2 tablespoons oil and season with salt. Mix onion and 2 tablespoons lime juice in a small bowl.
Grill shrimp until just opaque in center, 2-3 minutes per side. Transfer to a large plate. Grill lobster tails, flesh side down, until slightly charred, 1-2 minutes. Turn flesh side up and grill until just opaque in center, about 5 minutes longer. Add lobster tails to plate with shrimp and let rest for 5-10 minutes. Remove lobster meat from shells; discard shells. Cut lobster into 1" pieces.
Drain red onion; place in a large bowl. Add 3 tablespoons lime juice, 2 tablespoons oil, jicama, greens, tomatillos, and 1 cup cilantro. Season with salt and more lime juice, if desired. Add seafood; toss to coat. Drizzle Ancho Chile Oil over; garnish with cilantro.

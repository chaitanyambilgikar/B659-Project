Cook potatoes in large saucepan of boiling salted water until tender, about 30 minutes. Drain. Cool 15 minutes. Peel while still warm, then cut into 1/3-inch-thick slices. Transfer to medium bowl.
Meanwhile, cook bacon in medium skillet over medium-high heat until beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Add onion; reduce heat to medium-low. Sauté onion until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add broth and vinegar; bring to boil.
Pour hot dressing over potatoes; toss gently. Fold in 1/2 cup chives. Season with salt and pepper. Let stand until broth mixture is absorbed, occasionally tossing gently, about 30 minutes. Sprinkle salad with 1/4 cup chives. Toss gently and serve.

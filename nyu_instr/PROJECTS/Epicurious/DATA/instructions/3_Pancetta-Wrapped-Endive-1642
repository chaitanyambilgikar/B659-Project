Bring large pot of salted water to boil. Add lemon juice. Add endive quarters and cook 1 minute. Drain well. Transfer to bowl. Drizzle endive with olive oil. Season with salt and pepper. Wrap 1 slice of pancetta around center of each endive quarter. Place wrapped endive on heavy large baking sheet. (Can be prepared 4 hours ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
Preheat oven to 400°F. Bake wrapped endive until endive is tender and pancetta is crisp, about 20 minutes.

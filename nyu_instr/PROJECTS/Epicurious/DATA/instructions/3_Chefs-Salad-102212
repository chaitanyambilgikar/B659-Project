Shred carrots and thinly slice radishes. Cut ham into thin strips. Tear lettuces into bite-size pieces and in a bowl toss with sprouts. In a colander rinse and drain chick-peas. Salad ingredients may be prepared up to this point 4 hours ahead and chilled, covered.
Halve onion lengthwise and thinly slice crosswise. In a medium bowl dissolve salt in ice water and stir in onion. Let onion stand at least 15 minutes and up to 1 hour.
Make dressing: Chop garlic. In a blender or food processor finely chop herbs and garlic with vinegar and salt and, with motor running, add oil in a stream until blended. Dressing may be made 1 hour ahead and chilled, covered.
With a vegetable peeler shave thin slices from Parmigiano-Reggiano. Drain onion and pat dry. Halve tomatoes. In a large bowl combine all salad ingredients and toss with dressing and salt and pepper to taste.

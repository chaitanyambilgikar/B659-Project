1. In a medium nonreactive bowl, mix the dry rub with the apple juice, water, and salt until the salt is dissolved.
2. Funnel into a plastic squeeze bottle or put in a clean glass jar until ready to use. The mop will keep, tightly covered, in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. (If you add beer, use the mop the same day.) Shake before using.

Mix first 7 ingredients in medium bowl. Mix in crab. Mix in enough breadcrumbs (about 2 cups) to form mixture that barely holds together. Spread remaining breadcrumbs on baking sheet.
Shape crab mixture into eight 3/4-inch-thick patties. Coat crab cakes with remaining breadcrumbs, pressing to adhere. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 1 hour. (Can be prepared 4 hours ahead; keep refrigerated.)
Melt 1 tablespoon butter with 1 tablespoon oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add 4 crab cakes; reduce heat to medium and cook until brown, about 4 minutes per side. Wipe skillet clean. Repeat with remaining butter, oil and crab cakes. Transfer crab cakes to plates. Serve crab cakes immediately with lemon wedges.

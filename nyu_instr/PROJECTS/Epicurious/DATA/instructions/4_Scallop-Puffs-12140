In a saucepan combine the scallops with enough salted water to cover them completely, bring the water to a simmer, and poach the scallops for 5 minutes. Drain the scallops well and cut them into 1/2-inch pieces. In a bowl whisk together the mayonnaise, the Gruyére, the mustard, the lemon juice, the parsley, and salt and pepper to taste, add the scallops, and toss the mixture well. In a small bowl beat the egg white until it just holds stiff peaks and fold it into the scallop mixture gently but thoroughly. Top each bread square with a heaping teaspoon of the scallop mixture, arrange the puffs about 1/2 inch apart on baking sheets, and broil them under a preheated broiler about 6 inches from the heat for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the toppings are bubbling and lightly golden (do not allow the edges of the toasts to burn).

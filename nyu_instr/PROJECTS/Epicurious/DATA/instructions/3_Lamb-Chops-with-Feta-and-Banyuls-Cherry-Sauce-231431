Preheat oven to 400°F. Combine oil, garlic, and thyme in small bowl. Rub all over lamb; season with salt and pepper. Transfer to baking sheet.
Meanwhile, combine cherries, vinegar, broth, and sugar in small saucepan. Bring to boil over medium-high heat, stirring until sugar dissolves. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer until liquid is slightly reduced, about 15 minutes. Stir in butter. Season sauce with salt and pepper.
Bake lamb 10 minutes. Top with feta cheese; bake until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes longer. Divide lamb among plates. Top with sauce.

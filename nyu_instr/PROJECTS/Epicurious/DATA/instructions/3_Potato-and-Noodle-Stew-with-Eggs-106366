Heat oil in a 5-quart heavy pot over moderate heat until hot but not smoking, then cook onion, frying peppers, and garlic, stirring, until softened, 8 to 10 minutes. Add tomatoes and cook, covered, stirring occasionally, 10 minutes. Stir in potatoes, stock, cumin, saffron, parsley, bay leaf, salt, and black pepper, then bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Cover and simmer gently over low heat until potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes.
Stir in fideos and simmer, covered, over moderate heat until tender, about 10 minutes. Gently lower eggs (in their shells) into stew and simmer 10 minutes to hard-boil them. Transfer eggs with a slotted spoon to a bowl of cold water to cool, then peel and slice. Discard parsley and bay leaf.
Divide eggs among 4 shallow bowls and ladle stew over them.

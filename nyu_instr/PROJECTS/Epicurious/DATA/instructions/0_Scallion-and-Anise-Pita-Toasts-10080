Preheat broiler.
In a small saucepan, heat butter over moderate heat until foam subsides. Add scallion and aniseed and cook, stirring until scallion is slightly softened. Arrange pita halves, rough sides up, on a baking sheet and brush with butter mixture. Season pita halves with salt and pepper. Broil pita halves about 4 inches from heat 30 seconds, or until golden. Transfer pita toasts to a cutting board and immediately cut each into 6 wedges.

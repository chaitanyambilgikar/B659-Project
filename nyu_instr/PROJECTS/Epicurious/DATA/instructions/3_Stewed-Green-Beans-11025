In a large non-stick skillet heat oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and sauté green beans and onion with salt to taste, stirring occasionally, 8 to 10 minutes, or until beans begin to brown.
Add 1/4 cup water and cook until water is evaporated and skillet is almost dry. Add tomatoes, lemon juice, and salt to taste and cook, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are browned. Add remaining 2 tablespoons water and cook until it is evaporated and tomatoes are very soft.

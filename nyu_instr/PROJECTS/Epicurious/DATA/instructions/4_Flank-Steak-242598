1. Combine the marinade ingredients in a nonreactive bowl. Add the flank steaks and coat well with the marinade.
2. Marinate the steaks, covered, in the refrigerator for 30 minutes or overnight, turning once. Remove from the marinade and pat dry.
3. Broil or grill the steaks over high heat, 3 inches from the heat source, for 4 minutes per side for medium-rare meat. Remove to a cutting board and let rest for 10 minutes.
4. To serve, slice thinly on the diagonal and arrange on a board or platter.

Cook pancetta in oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until browned and crisp, 6 to 10 minutes. Transfer pancetta with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons fat from skillet. Add onion, garlic, and 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is softened and lightly browned, about 8 minutes. Stir in cream, sun-dried tomatoes, and pancetta and simmer until slightly thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat, then add arugula and stir until just wilted, about 1 minute.
Meanwhile, cook penne in a pasta pot of well-salted boiling water until al dente. Reserve 1 cup cooking water, then drain pasta.
Add pasta and cheese to skillet and toss with sauce. Thin sauce with some of reserved cooking water, then stir in basil.

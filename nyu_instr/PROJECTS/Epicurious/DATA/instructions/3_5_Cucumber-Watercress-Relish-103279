Stir mustard and fennel seeds in small skillet over medium-high heat until mustard seeds begin to pop, about 2 minutes. Transfer to medium glass bowl. Whisk in vinegar, oil and sugar. Add cucumber and onion; toss to combine. Season with salt and pepper. Let stand at room temperature 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. (Can be made 4 hours ahead. Cover; chill.) Mix watercress into relish and serve.

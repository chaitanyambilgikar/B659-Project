Coat cheese in flour, then egg, then breadcrumbs. Place on baking sheet. Cover and refrigerate until cold, at least 2 hours.
Meanwhile, melt butter in small skillet over low heat. Add garlic; sauté about 3 minutes. Transfer mixture to processor. Add parsley leaves, 1/4 cup oil, capers, anchovies, and lemon juice. Blend until coarse paste forms. Season with salt and pepper. (Cheese and sauce can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover separately; chill. Rewarm sauce slightly over low heat before serving.)
Heat 1/4 cup oil in large skillet over high heat. Working in batches, fry cheese until brown, about 2 minutes per side.
Transfer fried cheese to plates. Spoon warm sauce over cheese.

In a bowl whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt. In another bowl with an electric mixer cream butter and sugars until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition and beat in flour mixture. Beat in vanilla and stir in coconut and chocolate chips.
Drop dough by level tablespoons 2 inches apart onto buttered baking sheets and bake cookies in middle of oven 10 minutes, or until golden. Cool cookies on baking sheet 1 minute and transfer to racks to cool completely.

Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface; knead gently until smooth, about 8 turns. Roll out dough to 3/4-inch-thickness. Using 3-inch-diameter biscuit cutter, cut out biscuits. Gather dough scraps; roll out to 3/4-inch-thickness. Cut out additional biscuits. Transfer biscuits to prepared baking sheet. Bake until puffed and golden brown, about 15 minutes. Serve warm.

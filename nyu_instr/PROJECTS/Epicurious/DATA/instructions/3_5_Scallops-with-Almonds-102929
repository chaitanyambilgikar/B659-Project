Cook onion in butter in a heavy medium skillet over moderately low heat, stirring, until softened. Add brandy and cook until evaporated. Stir in cream, almonds, parsley, and Worcestershire sauce and simmer 1 minute.
Lightly season scallops with sea salt and add to sauce. Simmer gently just until sauce is thickened and scallops are cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve immediately in ramekins.

Slice thin the bottom 8 inches of the lemongrass stalks, put the sliced lemongrass in a very clean 1-quart glass jar, and bruise it with a wooden spoon. Add the vinegar and let the mixture steep, covered with the lid, in a cool dark place for at least 4 days and up to 2 weeks, depending on the strength desired. Strain the vinegar through a fine sieve into a glass pitcher, discarding the lemongrass slices, pour it into 2 very clean 1/2-pint glass jars, and seal the jars with the lids.

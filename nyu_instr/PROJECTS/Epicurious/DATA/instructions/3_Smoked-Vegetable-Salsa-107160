Combine first 5 ingredients in large bowl. Add oil; toss gently to coat. Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper.
Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Arrange hickory chips in foil pie pan; place directly atop coals. Allow chips to begin smoking, about 10 minutes. Grill vegetables until tender, turning frequently, about 10 minutes for tomatoes, 20 minutes for chilies, onion, and bell pepper, and 35 minutes for garlic. Transfer vegetables to cutting board. Cool. Remove any loosened peel from tomatoes, chilies, and bell pepper. Peel garlic. Coarsely chop all vegetables; transfer to medium bowl. Mix in cilantro and cayenne pepper. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be made 8 hours ahead. Cover; chill. Bring to room temperature before serving.)
* Also known as California chilies. Available at Latin American markets and many supermarkets.

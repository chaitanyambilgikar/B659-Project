Cut a shallow X in bottom of each peach with a sharp paring knife and blanch in a 3-quart saucepan of boiling water 10 seconds. Transfer peaches with a slotted spoon to a bowl of ice and cold water and let stand until cool enough to handle. Peel peaches, then halve lengthwise and pit. Cut peaches into 1-inch pieces, then toss with lemon juice and 2 tablespoons brandy in a bowl.
Cook sugar in a dry 9- to 10-inch heavy skillet over moderately low heat, stirring slowly with a fork (to help sugar melt evenly), until melted and pale golden. Cook caramel, without stirring, swirling skillet, until deep golden. Carefully add peach mixture (caramel will harden and steam vigorously) and cook, stirring frequently, until caramel is dissolved and peaches are tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and cool to room temperature, stirring occasionally, then stir in remaining tablespoon brandy.
Spoon 2 tablespoons peach mixture into each glass, then top with a small scoop of ice cream. Repeat with another layer of peaches and ice cream and spoon remaining peaches on top. Serve immediately.

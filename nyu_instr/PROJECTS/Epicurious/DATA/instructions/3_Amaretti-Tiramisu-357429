Beat together yolks and 2 tablespoons sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer at medium speed until thick and pale, about 2 minutes. Beat in mascarpone until just combined.
Beat whites with salt in another large bowl with cleaned beaters until they just hold soft peaks. Add remaining 3 tablespoons sugar, a little at a time, beating, then continue to beat until whites just hold stiff peaks.
Beat cream in another bowl with cleaned beaters until it just holds stiff peaks. Gently but thoroughly fold cream into mascarpone mixture, then fold mixture into whites.
Pour espresso into a shallow bowl. Dip half of amaretti (15 to 20) in espresso for about 20 seconds, turning to coat both sides and letting excess drip off. Arrange in 1 layer in an 8-inch square baking dish. Spread half of mascarpone mixture evenly over amaretti. Make another layer in same manner with remaining amaretti (dipped in espresso) and mascarpone mixture. Chill at least 6 hours.

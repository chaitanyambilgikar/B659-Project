Mix first 4 ingredients in medium bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Using wet hands, shape turkey mixture into 18 to 20 one-inch meatballs.
Bring broth to simmer in large pot over high heat. Add meatballs and simmer 2 minutes to set shape. Add hominy, tomato sauce, carrots, onion and chilies. Reduce heat to medium; simmer until meatballs are cooked through and vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cool, cover and chill. Bring to simmer before continuing.)
Add spinach and cilantro to soup and simmer until wilted, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.

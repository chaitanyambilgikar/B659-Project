Bring large pot of salted water to boil. Add carrot and cook until crisp-tender, about 4 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer carrot to strainer and cool. Add asparagus to boiling water and cook until just tender, about 3 minutes. Using slotted spoon, remove asparagus pieces, reserving tips for garnish. Add pasta to boiling water and cook until just tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally. Drain pasta. Return to same pot.
Meanwhile, heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add leeks and bell pepper; sauté 2 minutes. Add cream and simmer until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Mix in 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese and country ham.
Add carrot and asparagus pieces to sauce. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Pour sauce over pasta and toss to coat evenly. Divide pasta among 4 plates. Garnish with asparagus tips. Serve, passing additional Parmesan separately.

1. Prepare the Giblet Broth a day ahead: Simmer the broth ingredients until the giblets are tender, about 1 hour, skimming off any foam. Strain broth and set aide; reserve giblets and neck. Shred the meat from the neck and mince the giblets; combine. Cover and refrigerate the broth and meats until ready to use.
2. Preheat oven to 325°F. Squeeze orange halves inside turkey body and neck cavities; sprinkle with paprika, salt, and pepper. Fill cavities loosely with stuffing, using about 3 cups for the neck and 8 cups for the body. Truss the turkey. Rub with softened butter and sprinkle with paprika, salt, and pepper.
3. Place the turkey, breast-side up, on a rack in a roasting pan. Pour 2 cups of the reserved Giblet Broth into the bottom of the pan and cover the turkey loosely with foil. Place in the oven and roast for 1 1/2 hours.
4. Remove the foil and roast the turkey for 2 1/2 hours more, basting with the pan juices every 30 minutes.
5. Raise the oven temperature to 350°F and cook for an additional 1 to 1 1/4 hours, or until a thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh reads 180°F. The temperature at the thickest part of the breast should be 160°F. The juices should run clear when the thigh is pricked with a small knife.
6. Prepare Giblet Gravy: Heat pan juices in roasting pan, scraping up all brown bits. Defat; pour into a measuring cup.
7. Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and continue whisking for 2 to 3 minutes, or until mixture browns slightly. Slowly pour in 2 cups of the reserved pan juices, whisking constantly until smooth. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low and add remaining ingredients. Simmer for 10 minutes, stirring, until gravy has thickened. For a thinner gravy, add more broth. Adjust seasonings; heat before serving.

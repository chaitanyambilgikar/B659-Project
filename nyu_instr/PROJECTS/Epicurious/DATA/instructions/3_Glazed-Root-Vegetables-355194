Bring 1 1/4 cups water, honey, butter, and 1 teaspoon coarse salt to boil in medium saucepan over high heat. Add rutabagas and return water to boil. Cook for 2 minutes; add turnips. Boil until water is reduced to glaze and vegetables are tender, stirring occasionally, about 7 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Toss with parsley.

For brioche crust: Butter 9-inch springform pan. Mix flour, sugar, yeast and salt in processor. Add butter; using on/off turns, blend until butter is reduced to pea-size pieces. Add eggs and milk. Using on/off turns, blend until sticky dough forms. Using buttered fingertips, press dough onto pan bottom. Cover with plastic. Let dough rise in warm draft-free area until doubled in volume, about 1 3/4 hours.
Meanwhile, prepare filling and sauce: Stir wine and 3/4 cup sugar in medium saucepan over medium-high heat until sugar dissolves and mixture boils. Add pears. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer until pears are tender, about 8 minutes. Cool mixture 30 minutes.
Using slotted spoon, transfer pears to plate. Boil wine syrup in pan until reduced to 1 cup, about 4 minutes. Mix cornstarch and 1 teaspoon water in small bowl; stir into wine syrup. Cook until syrup thickens and boils, whisking occasionally, about 1 minute longer. Set sauce aside.
Position rack in top third of oven; preheat to 400°F. Starting at edge of pan and leaving 1/2-inch plain border, arrange pear slices close together in concentric circles on dough. Sprinkle pears and dough edge with 2 tablespoons sugar.
Bake tart until edge is brown, pears are tender and crust is cooked through, about 30 minutes. Transfer to rack; release pan sides. Cool at least 15 minutes. Cut tart into wedges; place on plates. Serve with sauce and crème fraîche.

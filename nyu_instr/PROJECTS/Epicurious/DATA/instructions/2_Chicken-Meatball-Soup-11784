In a bowl combine well the chicken, the parsley, the Worcestershire sauce, the salt, the sage, and pepper to taste and form the mixture into 1-inch balls. In a large saucepan cook the white part of the scallion in the butter over moderately low heat until it is softened, add the wine, and simmer the mixture until the wine is reduced by half. Add the broth, bring the liquid to a boil, and add the meatballs and the snow peas. Simmer the soup, covered, for 5 minutes, or until the meatballs are cooked through, and stir in the green part of the scallion and salt and pepper to taste.

In a food processor purée the coriander, the mint, the jalapeño pepper, the garlic, the gingerroot, the lemon juice, the cumin, the honey, and salt and pepper to taste, scraping down the side of the bowl occasionally, transfer the chutney to a bowl, and whisk in the yogurt. The chutney may be made 3 hours in advance and kept covered and chilled. Makes about 3/4 cup.

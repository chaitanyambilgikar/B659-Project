Cut ciabatta into 8 even slices (4 tops and 4 bottoms). Spread 1 tablespoon of roasted garlic purée onto each of the 4 bottoms. Place 4 ounces of Havarti (1/4 cup) on top of each of the 4 garlic rubbed pieces of bread. Close each with the top half of the bread.
Place each of the prepared sandwiches in a frying pan over medium heat. Cook about 3-4 minutes on the first side. Turn carefully and cook for 2-3 minutes longer on the second side.
Coat heads well with olive oil and place in 350°F. oven for approximately 1 hour. When cooled, squeeze garlic from cloves and purée or mash with a fork.

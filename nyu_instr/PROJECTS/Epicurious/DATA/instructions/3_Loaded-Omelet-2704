Preheat broiler. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and sauté until translucent, about 4 minutes. Transfer onion to small bowl. Melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter in same skillet. Add eggs to skillet and season with salt and pepper. Cook until edges of omelet are set, about 1 minute. Lift edges of omelet and tilt skillet, allowing uncooked eggs to flow under cooked edges. Continue cooking until eggs are almost set, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle sautéed onion, green onions, cream cheese, smoked salmon and mozzarella over omelet. Broil until mozzarella melts, about 3 minutes. Cut omelet into wedges and top with caviar.

Into a bowl finely shred 8 radishes and squeeze out excess liquid. In another bowl stir together cream cheese, herbs, and lemon juice. Stir in grated radishes and salt and pepper to taste. Radish mixture may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.
Just before serving, spread radish mixture on toasts. Thinly slice remaining radishes and arrange a few slices decoratively on each canapé. Sprinkle canapés with salt to taste.

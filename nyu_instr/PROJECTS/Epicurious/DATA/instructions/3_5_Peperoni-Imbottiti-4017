Lightly oil 13 x 9-inch baking dish. Char peppers over gas flame or in broiler until blackened on all sides but not soft. Wrap in paper bag and let stand 10 minutes. Peel peppers. Cut lengthwise in half. Cut out stems and scrape out seeds. Arrange peppers, cut side up, in single layer in prepared dish.
Preheat oven to 350°F. Place raisins in small bowl. Add enough hot water to cover. Let stand 10 minutes. Drain raisins; chop coarsely. Place in medium bowl. Add breadcrumbs and next 8 ingredients; toss to combine. Season with pepper. Mix in 3 tablespoons oil. Spoon into peppers. Drizzle 2 tablespoons oil over. (Can be made 6 hours ahead. Cover and chill.) Bake until peppers are heated through but still hold their shape, about 30 minutes. Serve hot or at room temperature.

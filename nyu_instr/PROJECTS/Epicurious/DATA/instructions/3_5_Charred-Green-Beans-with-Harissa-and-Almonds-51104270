Char bell pepper (if using fresh) and jalapenños directly over a gas flame or under a broiler until soft and charred all over, 12-15 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl; cover with plastic wrap. Let steam for 15 minutes.
Peel, seed, and mince bell pepper and jalapenños. Combine peppers, chiles, garlic, and 1 teaspoon salt in a food processor. Pulse, scraping down sides of bowl, to make a coarse paste. Pulse in 1 tablespoon oil, lemon juice, coriander, and cumin. Season harissa with salt and black pepper.
Place beans in a medium bowl; drizzle with remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Season with salt and black pepper and toss to coat. heat a large cast-iron skillet or other large heavy skillet over high heat. Working in batches, cook beans, turning occasionally, until blistered and charred in places but still crisp-tender, 6-8 minutes. (Or cook them in a grill basket on the grill.) Transfer to a large bowl; toss with harissa and almonds. Serve warm or at room temperature.

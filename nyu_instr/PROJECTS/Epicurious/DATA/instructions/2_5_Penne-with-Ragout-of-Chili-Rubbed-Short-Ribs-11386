Preheat oven to 275°F.
In a heavy casserole just large enough to hold short ribs in one layer spread tomato slices evenly.
In a small bowl stir together garlic paste, oil, chili powder, and cumin and spread evenly on short ribs. Arrange short ribs on tomatoes and roast in middle of oven, covered tightly, 3 1/2 hours, basting once or twice after 1 hour. (Meat will give off juices as it cooks.) Transfer short ribs to a cutting board. Discard bones and gristle and chop meat. Chill meat, covered.
Force tomato mixture through a food mill fitted with fine disk into a bowl. Chill tomato sauce, covered, at least 1 hour or up to 24 hours, and skim fat.
In a 6-quart kettle bring 5 quarts salted water to a boil for pasta.
Transfer tomato sauce to a saucepan and stir in meat, olives, Worcestershire sauce, and salt and pepper to taste. Bring sauce to a simmer and keep warm.
While sauce is heating, add pasta to boiling water and boil until al dente. Drain pasta in a colander and transfer to a large bowl. Pour sauce over pasta and stir together. Add parsley and Parmesan and toss to combine.

Cut off and discard the stems of the artichokes with a stainless-steel knife, break off the tough outer leaves, and cut off the top fourth of the artichokes. Snip off the tips of the artichoke leaves with scissors and rub the cut edges with the lemon half. In a 3-quart microwave-safe casserole with a lid combine the water and the artichokes, microwave the artichokes, covered, at high power (100%) for 15 minutes, or until the bases are tender, and let them stand, covered, for 5 minutes.
In a bowl whisk together the vinegar, the oil, and salt and pepper to taste, whisking the dressing until it is emulsified, and whisk in the scallion greens and the tomato. Arrange the artichokes on 2 plates, spoon the dressing over them, and serve the artichokes at room temperature.

Trim pork of excess fat and silver skin, then cut crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Cut each slice into 3 strips.
Cook onion in oil in a 4-quart heavy pot over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add ketchup, chili sauce, Worcestershire sauce, vinegar, hot sauce, and water and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.
Add pork and simmer, covered, until pork is cooked through and tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer pork with a slotted spoon to a bowl and cover to keep warm. Boil remaining sauce, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 3 minutes. Pour sauce over pork.

In an 8-quart kettle or stockpot combine chicken, water, onions, celery, and salt and pepper to taste and cook, covered, at a brisk boil until chicken is tender, bout 30 minutes.
Remove kettle from heat and transfer chicken to a bowl. When chicken is cool enough to handle remove meat, discarding skin and bones. Tear chicken into bite-size shreds.
In a food processor pulse tomatoes with their juice until soupy but still slightly chunky.
Return kettle of broth to heat and add tomatoes. Bring soup to a boil and add vermicelli. Cook 7 to 10 minutes, or until noodles are nearly tender. Add chicken and cook a few minutes more.
Just before serving, stir in Romano.

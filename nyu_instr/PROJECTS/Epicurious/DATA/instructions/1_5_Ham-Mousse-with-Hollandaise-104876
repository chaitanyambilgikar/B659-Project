Preheat oven to 300°F.
Whisk yolks in a bowl, then whisk in ham, nutmeg, white pepper, cayenne, and salt.
Beat together cream and Sherry in another bowl with an electric mixer until cream holds soft peaks, then fold into ham gently but thoroughly.
Beat egg whites with a pinch of salt in another bowl with cleaned beaters until frothy, then fold into ham gently but thoroughly.
Spread mousse in well-buttered loaf pan and bake, uncovered, in a hot water bath in middle of oven until a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean and mousse is firm to the touch, about 1 1/2 hours.
Transfer loaf pan to a rack and cool mousse 40 minutes. Run dull side of a thin knife or a small spatula around edges and invert mousse onto a plate.

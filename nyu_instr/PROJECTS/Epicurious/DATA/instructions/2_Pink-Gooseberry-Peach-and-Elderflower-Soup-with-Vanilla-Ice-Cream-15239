Pull off tops and tails of gooseberries and halve berries lengthwise. Transfer berries to a 1-quart heatproof jar or a heatproof bowl. In a small saucepan bring wine, water, elderflower concentrate, and sugar to a boil, stirring until sugar is dissolved, and pour hot syrup over berries. Cool mixture. Chill mixture, covered, until cold, at least 2 hours, and up to 6.
Peel peaches and cut into very thin wedges. Gently stir peaches into berry mixture and divide among 6 soup plates. Thinly slice basil and sprinkle over soup. Scoop ice cream into soup.

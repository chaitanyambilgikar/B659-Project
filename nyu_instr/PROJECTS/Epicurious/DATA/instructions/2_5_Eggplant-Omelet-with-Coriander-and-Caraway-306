Preheat broiler. Pierce eggplants all over with fork. Place eggplants in baking pan. Broil eggplants until skins blacken and flesh feels very soft to touch, turning occasionally, about 25 minutes. Cool eggplants; stem and peel. Transfer eggplants to colander and let drain 30 minutes, turning occasionally and pressing with spoon to extract liquid. Transfer eggplants to bowl; mash.
Heat 3 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium-low heat. Add onions; sauté until golden, about 20 minutes. Add garlic and sauté 4 minutes. Set aside.
Whisk eggs in large bowl to blend. Mix in mashed eggplant, onion mixture, chopped parsley, caraway, coriander, salt and pepper.

Serve hot or at room temperature.

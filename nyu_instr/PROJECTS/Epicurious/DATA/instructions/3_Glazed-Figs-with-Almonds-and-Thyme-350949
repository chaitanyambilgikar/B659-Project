Simmer wine, honey, figs, and thyme sprig in a small saucepan 3 minutes. Remove from heat and let steep, covered, 10 minutes. Return to heat and simmer, uncovered, until liquid is just syrupy, about 10 minutes. Cool figs in syrup. Cut a slit in each fig and gently press in a nut. Sprinkle with thyme leaves. Serve warm or at room temperature.

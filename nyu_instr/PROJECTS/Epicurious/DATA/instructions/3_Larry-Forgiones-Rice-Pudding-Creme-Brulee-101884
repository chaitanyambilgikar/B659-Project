Bring the milk to a boil. Add the rice, vanilla bean, cinnamon stick, and sugar and reduce heat to a simmer. Cook until rice is tender (approx. 40-50 minutes), taking care not to overcook. Cool.
Pour the pudding into a large ovenproof dish (11x8x2) or into individual dishes. Sprinkle with the additional sugar. Place the dish or dishes under the broiler and while watching carefully melt and caramelize the sugar. Serve immediately.

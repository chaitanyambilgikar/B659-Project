In a small bowl stir together the chili powder, the cumin, the thyme, the sugar, the salt, the allspice, and the black pepper. Sprinkle the spice mixture over the chops, rub it evenly all over the meat, and chill the chops, covered, for at least 4 hours or overnight.
Prepare a grill with glowing coals or preheat the broiler. On the oiled rack of the grill or on a broiler pan in the broiler grill or broil the chops 4 inches from the heat for 5 to 7 minutes on each side for medium-rare meat. Serve the chops with the pepper jelly.

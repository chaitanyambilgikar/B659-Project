1. Heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat and add the oats. Toast for 3 to 4 minutes, stirring all the time, until the oats are beginning to turn golden. Transfer to a plate and cool.
2. Whisk the cream with the whisky and 2 tablespoons of the honey until soft peaks form.
3. Spoon the mixture into 4 dessert glasses. Cover and chill for 3 hours.
4. When ready to serve, sprinkle with the toasted oats and drizzle with the remaining honey. Top with raspberries and serve.

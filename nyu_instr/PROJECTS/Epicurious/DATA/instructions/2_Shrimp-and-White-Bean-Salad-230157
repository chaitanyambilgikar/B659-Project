If using dried beans: Soak beans in water overnight and drain thoroughly. Put beans, garlic, carrot, bay leaf, and 2 cups water in a large saucepan over medium heat and bring to a boil. Add salt, reduce heat to low and simmer until beans are tender, about 1 hour. Strain and reserve beans, discarding garlic, carrot, and bay leaf. Let beans cool to room temperature. If using canned beans, rinse and drain thoroughly. Season shrimp on both sides with salt and pepper. Heat 2 tbsp oil in a medium sauté pan over medium heat. Add shrimp and sauté, stirring occasionally, until shrimp are no longer translucent, about 3 minutes. (If using frozen shrimp, thaw before cooking.) Transfer shrimp to a large mixing bowl and add celery, onion, capers, parsley, chives, remaining 1 tbsp oil, and beans. Toss well; season to taste with salt and pepper. Divide lettuce among 4 plates and arrange 1 cup shrimp mixture on top of each mound of lettuce.

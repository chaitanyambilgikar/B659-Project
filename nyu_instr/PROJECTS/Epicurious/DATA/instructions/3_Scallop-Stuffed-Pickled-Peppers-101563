In a ceramic or glass bowl combine the scallops with the lime juice and let them marinate, covered and chilled, stirring several times, for at least 4 hours or overnight (The scallops will "cook" in the lime juice.)
Make a lengthwise slit in each pickled pepper, transfer the peppers slit side down to paper towels, and let them drain for 5 minutes. Drain the scallops, reserving the lime juice and stuff a scallop slice curved side up into each pepper. (The stuffed peppers may be prepared up to 4 hours ahead and kept covered and chilled.) Just before serving brush the scallops with the reserved lime juice and arrange the stuffed peppers decoratively on platters lined with the cabbage.

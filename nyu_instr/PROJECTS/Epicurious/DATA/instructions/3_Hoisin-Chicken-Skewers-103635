Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Whisk first 4 ingredients in medium bowl to blend. Place 2 tablespoons sauce in small bowl for glaze. Mix chicken into remaining sauce; let stand 10 minutes. Thread chicken onto 4 metal skewers, spacing pieces 1/2 inch apart. Sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper. Grill chicken until cooked through and slightly charred, brushing with glaze and turning often, about 8 minutes. Sprinkle with sesame seeds.

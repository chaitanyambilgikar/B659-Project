1. Preheat the oven to 400°F. Cut each onion into quarters, keeping the root end still intact so wedges hold together.
2. In a large bowl, combine the lemon juice, mustard, garlic, thyme, salt, and pepper. Slowly whisk in the olive oil.
3. Add the onions to the bowl and mix well. Transfer the onions to a baking dish or sheet in a single layer. Bake for 30 to 45 minutes, until tender and browned at the edges. Toss the onions as necessary during cooking to ensure even browning.
4. Remove onions from the oven and transfer to a serving platter. Sprinkle with the cilantro.

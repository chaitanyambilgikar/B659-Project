Preheat broiler. Brush some of butter over 2 broiler-proof plates. Peel mango. Cut small slice off stem end. Stand mango on cut end. Starting at top, just off center, cut 1 side of mango off pit. Repeat on opposite side. Cut each mango half lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick slices (do not separate slices). Using spatula, transfer 1 half to each prepared plate. Press gently on mango to fan slightly. Sprinkle with lime juice. Mix sugar and ginger; sprinkle over mango. Drizzle with remaining butter.
Broil mango until topping is golden and bubbling, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle coconut over mango. Broil until coconut is toasted, about 45 seconds. Serve hot.

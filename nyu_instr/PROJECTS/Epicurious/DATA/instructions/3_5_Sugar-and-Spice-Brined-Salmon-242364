1. At least 2 hours and up to 8 hours before you plan to smoke the fish, combine the marinade ingredients in a bowl. Place the salmon in a plastic bag or shallow dish, pour the marinade over it, and refrigerate it for at least 1 hour. Leave it longer to intensify the seasoning.
2. Prepare the smoker for barbecuing, bringing the temperature to 180°F to 200°F.
3. Remove the salmon from the refrigerator, and drain it, reserving the marinade if you plan to baste the fish. Leave any clinging spices on the surface of the salmon. Let the fish sit uncovered at room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes.
4. If you are using the marinade as a mop, stir the brine together with 1 cup water in a small saucepan and boil vigorously for a few minutes.
5. Transfer the salmon to the smoker, skin side down. Cook for 45 to 55 minutes, mopping it after 10 and 30 minutes in a wood-burning pit, or as appropriate for your style of smoker. Have a large spatula and a platter ready for taking the salmon off the smoker, since it will be fragile when done. We prefer to serve the salmon with some of the whole spices clinging to it. The fish can be eaten immediately or refrigerated and later served chilled. If you are using the fresh dill, arrange it on a serving platter. Top the dill with the salmon, and serve.

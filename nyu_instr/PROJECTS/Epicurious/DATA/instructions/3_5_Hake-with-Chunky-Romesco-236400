Put oven rack in upper third of oven and preheat oven to 450°F.
Coat bottom of a 13- by 9-inch baking dish with 1 tablespoon oil and add fish, skinned side down. Sprinkle fish with salt and pepper.
Cook garlic, almonds, and bread in 2 tablespoons oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat, stirring, until pale golden, 6 to 8 minutes. Stir in parsley and spoon over fish. Bake fish, uncovered, 5 minutes. Loosely cover with foil and bake until fish is just cooked through, 20 to 28 minutes more (depending on thickness of fish). Drizzle with 1 tablespoon oil.
Coarsely chop red peppers in a food processor. Add vinegar, cayenne, and remaining 1/4 cup oil and pulse until just combined.
Serve fish topped with sauce.

Make wafers: Preheat oven to 325° F. and spray a heavy or non-stick baking sheet with cooking spray or line with parchment paper.
Rub off loose skins from pistachios and in a food processor grind nuts with granulated sugar. In a bowl whisk together pistachio mixture, flour, and salt and whisk in whites, butter, and vanilla until combined well. Drop rounded teaspoons batter 5 inches apart onto baking sheet and with back of a spoon spread into 3 1/2- to 4-inch rounds. Bake wafers in middle of oven 8 minutes, or until golden.
Working quickly, transfer hot wafers with a thin metal spatula to a rack to cool completely. (If wafers become too crisp to remove from baking sheet, return to oven 1 minute, or until heated through and pliable.) Make more wafers with remaining batter in same manner, spraying or re-lining sheet for each batch. Wafers may be made 2 days ahead and kept in an airtight container at room temperature. Makes 16 to 20 wafers.
Into a chilled bowl scrape seeds of vanilla bean and add cream and granulated sugar. With a whisk or an electric mixer beat mixture until it holds stiff peaks. Whipped cream may be made 2 hours ahead and chilled, covered. Whisk cream briefly before using.
Just before serving, assemble mille-feuillantines: Put a wafer in center of each of 4 plates. Spread about 2 tablespoons whipped cream on each wafer, leaving a 1/4-inch border, and top with half of strawberries. Put another wafer on top of strawberries and top in same manner with remaining cream and strawberries. Dust 4 wafers with confectioners' sugar and put on top of desserts. Garnish each mille-feuillantine with a strawberry and sprinkle plates with pistachios.

Preheat broiler. Line large baking sheet with foil. Toss peas with oil on prepared baking sheet. Spread peas in single layer. Broil until just crisp-tender and beginning to brown in spots, stirring once with spatula, about 2 minutes. Transfer to bowl. Sprinkle with fleur de sel, then chives, and serve.

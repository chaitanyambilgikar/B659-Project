Fill large bowl with cold water. Add enough water to large pot to measure 3 inches in depth; add vinegar and bring to simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low. Crack eggs open 1 at a time over simmering water and drop in. Poach eggs until whites are set, about 4 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer eggs to bowl of cold water to stop cooking; reserve pot of vinegar water.
Melt half of butter in each of 2 large nonstick skillets over low heat. Add half of sweet potatoes, leeks, bell pepper and thyme to each skillet; stir to coat with butter. Cover skillets; cook until potatoes are tender, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes. Increase heat to medium-high. Uncover; cook without stirring until potatoes are golden on bottom, about 3 minutes. Using spatula, turn hash over in sections and cook without stirring until potatoes are golden on bottom, about 3 minutes longer. Fold half of fresh salmon, maple syrup and sage into hash in each skillet. Cook until salmon is just opaque in center, stirring occasionally, about 3 minutes. Mix half of smoked salmon into hash in each skillet. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat.
Meanwhile, bring reserved vinegar water to simmer; turn off heat. Transfer eggs to hot water 1 minute to rewarm.
Spoon hash onto plates. Remove eggs from water and place atop hash. Sprinkle with paprika and chives.

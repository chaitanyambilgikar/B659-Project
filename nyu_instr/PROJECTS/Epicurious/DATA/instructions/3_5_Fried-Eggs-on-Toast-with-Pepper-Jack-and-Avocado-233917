Preheat broiler. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in heavy large broilerproof skillet over medium heat. Crack eggs into skillet; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cook until egg whites are just set on bottom, about 2 minutes. Remove skillet from heat; top each egg with 1 cheese slice. Broil until cheese just melts, about 1 minute.
Spread remaining 2 tablespoons butter on toast; top with eggs, then avocado slices. Sprinkle with cilantro.

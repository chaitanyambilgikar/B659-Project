In a bowl whisk together flour, beer, and salt and season with pepper.
Halve zucchini crosswise. Cut each half into 6 spears and put, skin side down, on a cutting board. With a sharp thin knife cut a lengthwise slit about 1/2 inch deep along top edge of each spear. Halve basil leaves lengthwise and, using dull side of a small knife, push a half leaf into slit of each spear.
In an 8-inch heavy saucepan or deep skillet heat 1 inch oil over moderate heat until a deep-fat thermometer registers 375° F.
Working in batches of 6, coat spears in batter, letting excess drip off, and fry until deep golden, about 2 minutes, transferring with tongs to paper towels to drain.

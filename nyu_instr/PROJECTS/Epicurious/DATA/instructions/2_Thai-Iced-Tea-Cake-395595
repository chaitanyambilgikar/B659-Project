1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Use butter wrapper to grease an 8-inch loaf pan, 8-inch square cake pan, or 8-inch round cake pan.
2. Brew tea with 3/4 cup boiling water, covered, for 10 minutes. Strain tea leaves and discard. In a mixing bowl, combine butter and freshly brewed tea until butter is completely melted. Whisk vanilla, half of the sweetened condensed milk, and the eggs. Mixture should be bright orange and very creamy. Gently stir in salt, flour, and baking powder. Pour into prepared pan and bake for 35–45 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow cake to cool for 20 minutes.
3. While cake cools, make the glaze. Whisk together remaining sweetened condensed milk and powdered sugar until a thick, creamy mixture forms.
4. To serve cake, run a knife along the edge of the cooled cake to gently loosen it from its pan. Turn cake out onto a plate and drizzle glaze over the top, allowing it to run down the sides of the cake.
5. Cake can either be served immediately or chilled and served cold.

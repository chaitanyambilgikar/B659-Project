Combine oil, vinegar, garlic, and salt to make a marinade. Place lamb skin-side up in a shallow pan and pour the marinade over it. Slather mustard on skin side. Cover and let marinate over night. To cook, place lamb mustard-side down on a very hot grill, five inches from flame. When brown on one side, turn. Cook about one hour total, checking for doneness at 45 minutes. Slice thinly to serve.

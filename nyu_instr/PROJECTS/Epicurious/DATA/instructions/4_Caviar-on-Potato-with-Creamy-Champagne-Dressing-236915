Make potatoes: Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Boil the potatoes until just cooked through, about 5 minutes. Drain and cool immediately; set aside.
Make dressing: In a mixing bowl combine the sour cream, sparkling wine, chives, and lemon zest.
Assemble: Add the well-drained, cooled potatoes to the dressing and gently mix until combined. Fill 8 shot glasses almost to the rim with potato salad. (You can also use 4 martini or other glasses, Chinese soupspoons, or other small containers.) Top with 1/4 ounce of caviar. Serve immediately or keep chilled until service.

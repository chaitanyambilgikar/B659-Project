Stir together milk, sugar, tapioca, espresso powder, and egg in a 2- to 3-quart heavy saucepan and let stand 5 minutes. Heat over moderately low heat, stirring, just until pudding reaches a simmer. Stir in Sambuca and cool pudding, its surface covered directly with wax paper. Serve at room temperature or chilled.

Keeping celery ribs attached at base, peel outer ribs of celery hearts with a vegetable peeler, then trim ends and halve hearts lengthwise.
Melt butter in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat. Add celery and cook, turning with tongs occasionally, until pale golden on all sides, about 8 minutes. Add remaining ingredients and cook, covered, until liquid is evaporated and celery is tender and golden, about 20 minutes. Serve warm.

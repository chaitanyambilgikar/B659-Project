Combine the sauerkraut, caraway seeds, peppercorns or cracked pepper and carrots. Place in the bottom of a large kettle. Arrange the pork butt slices and the shoulder chops over the top of the sauerkraut. Add the wine and salt, cover tightly and cook over very low heat 2-3 hours. This dish tastes best if cooked a day ahead, as it should be prepared at least 6 hours before serving time and allowed to stand. Reheat, adding knockwurst, approximately 20 minutes before serving. Serve with boiled or mashed potatoes.

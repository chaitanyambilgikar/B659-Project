In the large bowl of an electric mixer proof the yeast with 1/2 teaspoon of the sugar in 3/4 cup lukewarm water for 5 minutes, or until it is foamy. Add the remaining teaspoon sugar, 2 cups of the flour, the table salt, and the oil and beat the mixture with the dough hook until it is combined. Knead the dough, kneading in enough of the remaining 1 cup flour to make the dough form a ball, and knead the dough for 5 minutes, or until it is soft but not sticky. On a lightly floured surface let the dough rest, covered with a kitchen towel, for 15 minutes. Divide the dough into 12 pieces, working with 1 piece at a time and keeping the remaining pieces covered roll the dough between the palms of the hands to form 14-inch ropes, and arrange the ropes as they are formed 2 inches apart on baking sheets sprinkled lightly with the cornmeal. Let the breadsticks rise, covered loosely, in a warm place for 40 minutes, brush them lightly with the egg wash, and sprinkle them with the fennel seeds and the coarse salt. Bake the breadsticks in the middle of a preheated 45°F. oven for 12 to 15 minutes, or until they are pale golden, and let them cool on a rack for 10 minutes. The breadsticks may be made 1 day in advance and kept in an airtight container.

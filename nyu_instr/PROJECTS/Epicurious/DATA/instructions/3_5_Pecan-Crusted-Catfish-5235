For sauce: Combine wine, fresh lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce and garlic in small nonaluminum saucepan. Boil until liquid is reduced to 1/2 cup, about 8 minutes. Add cream. Boil until sauce thickens slightly, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low. Whisk in butter 1 tablespoon at a time. Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper. Strain sauce into small bowl. Return sauce to pan.
Meanwhile, prepare fish: Preheat oven to 400°F. Place flour on large plate. Whisk milk and egg in shallow bowl to blend. Sprinkle catfish fillets with salt and pepper. Lightly coat catfish fillets in flour. Dip into milk mixture. Coat 1 side of fish with pecans. Lightly coat second side with flour.
Heat 1/2 tablespoon oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Add 2 fish fillets to skillet, nut side down, and cook until nuts begin to brown, about 2 minutes. Turn fish over; cook 1 minute. Using metal spatula, transfer fish, nut side up, to rimmed baking sheet. Repeat with remaining fish and 1/2 tablespoon oil. Bake until opaque in center, about 10 minutes.
Transfer catfish fillets to plates. Serve catfish with sauce.

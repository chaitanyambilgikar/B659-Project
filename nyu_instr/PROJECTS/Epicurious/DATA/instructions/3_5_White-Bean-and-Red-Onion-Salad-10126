In a large saucepan combine beans with water to cover by 2 inches and add salt, bay leaves, and coriander seeds. Simmer beans, uncovered, stirring occasionally and adding more hot water if necessary to keep beans covered, 1 to 1 1/4 hours, or until beans are just tender but not mushy.
Make dressing while beans are cooking: Mince garlic fine and in a large bowl stir together well with lemon juice and oil.
In a colander drain beans, discarding bay leaves, and add to dressing. Toss salad and season with salt and pepper. Cool salad and stir in onion and herbs. Salad may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.
Serve salad at room temperature, thinning if necessary with 1 to 2 tablespoons water.

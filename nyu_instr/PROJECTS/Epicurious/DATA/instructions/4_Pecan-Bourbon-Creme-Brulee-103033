Preheat oven to 350°F. Place six 3/4-cup soufflé dishes or custard cups in large roasting pan. Whisk egg yolks, sugar, bourbon and vanilla extract in large bowl to blend. Bring whipping cream to boil in heavy medium saucepan. Gradually whisk hot whipping cream into egg yolk mixture. Pour custard into soufflé dishes, dividing equally.
Pour enough hot water into roasting pan to come halfway up sides of soufflé dishes. Bake custards until just set in center, about 30 minutes. Remove from water and cool completely. Cover and refrigerate at least 6 hours. (Custards can be prepared up to 2 days ahead. Keep covered and refrigerated.)
Preheat broiler. Arrange soufflé dishes on baking sheet. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon golden brown sugar evenly over each. Broil until sugar melts and turns dark brown, rotating baking sheet for even browning and watching closely, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle crèmes brûl´es with chopped toasted pecans, dividing equally. Cool slightly and serve.

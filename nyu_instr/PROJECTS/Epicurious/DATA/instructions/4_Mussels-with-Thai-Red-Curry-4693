Melt 1/4 cup butter in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add tomatoes, garlic and ginger; sauté until garlic is tender, about 2 minutes. Mix in coconut milk, curry paste, 1/4 cup chopped cilantro and salt. Simmer 4 minutes to blend flavors. Add mussels; cover and cook until mussels open, about 5 minutes (discard any mussels that do not open). Transfer mixture to serving bowl. Garnish with 3 tablespoons chopped cilantro.

Lightly oil heavy large baking sheet. Brush both sides of 12 eggplant rounds generously with dressing; arrange on prepared sheet. Sprinkle rosemary and oregano over. Let stand at room temperature 30 minutes.
Preheat broiler. Broil eggplant on baking sheet until brown and cooked through, about 5 minutes per side. (Can be prepared 1 hour ahead. Let stand at room temperature.)
Preheat oven to 450°F. Top each eggplant slice with 1 rounded tablespoon sauce. Place 1 provolone slice atop each eggplant round and trim to fit. Sprinkle each with 1 tablespoon Parmesan. Bake until cheeses melt and eggplant is heated through, about 5 minutes.

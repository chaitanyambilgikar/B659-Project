Make dressing: Chop shallot and crush star anise. In a blender blend shallot, oil, orange juice, and Port until emulsified. Transfer mixture to a small bowl or jar and add star anise and salt and pepper to taste. Chill dressing, covered, at least 4 hours and up to 1 day. Pour dressing through a sieve into a bowl and discard solids. Whisk dressing until combined well.
Make salad: Preheat oven to 400°F. and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Halve and core pears. Cut pears lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick slices and arrange in one layer on baking sheet. Roast pears in middle of oven until pale golden, about 10 minutes, and cool on baking sheet.
Separate endive leaves, and, if desired, cut leaves crosswise into 1 1/2-inch-thick pieces.
On a platter or 4 salad plates arrange pears, endive leaves, and Stilton and drizzle dressing on top. Garnish salad with parsley or chervil.

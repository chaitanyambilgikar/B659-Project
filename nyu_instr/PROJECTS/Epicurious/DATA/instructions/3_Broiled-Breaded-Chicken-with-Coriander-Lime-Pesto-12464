To make the chicken: In a shallow baking dish whisk together milk, egg, oil, and salt and pepper to taste. In another shallow baking dish stir together bread crumbs, cumin, paprika, and salt and pepper to taste.
Set rack about 6 inches from heat and preheat broiler.
Dip chicken breasts, 1 at a time, in milk mixture, letting excess drip off, and coat with bread crumb mixture, patting to adhere. Transfer chicken as coated to rack of a foil-lined broiler pan. Broil chicken until cooked through, about 7 minutes on each side.
In a small bowl whisk together pesto, yogurt, lime juice, and 1 tablespoon hot water, adding additional hot water if necessary to reach desired consistency. Season pesto with salt and pepper and serve over chicken.
To make the pesto: In a food processor blend together all ingredients with salt and pepper to taste until smooth. (Pesto keeps, surface covered with plastic wrap, chilled, 1 week.) Makes about 2/3 cup.

Heat 1 tablespoon oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add next 3 ingredients; sauté until onions are brown, about 20 minutes. Add remaining oil and all mushrooms; sauté 5 minutes. Stir in chili powder. Sauté until juices evaporate, about 5 minutes. Add beans and salsa; sauté 3 minutes. Stir in cilantro. Season with salt and pepper.
Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350°F. Wrap tortillas in foil; heat in oven 15 minutes. Place 1 tortilla on each of 6 plates. Spoon mushroom mixture down center of each tortilla, dividing equally. Sprinkle each with 1 tablespoon goat cheese. Fold short ends of tortilla over filling. Roll up, enclosing filling.

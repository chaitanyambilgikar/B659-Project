In a bowl, combine the dissolved Jell-O, cold water, mayonnaise, and vinegar and mix thoroughly. Transfer to the freezer or refrigerator and allow it to chill well. When it begins to get firm, remove it from the freezer or refrigerator and beat with an electric beater until fluffy. Add cottage cheese and chopped vegetables. Before you put the mixture into a mold, decorate the bottom of the mold with olives or parsley so that when you unmold it there will be a pretty design on top.
Another variation is to forego the vinegar and add fruit with the cottage cheese. Just be sure that the salad is firm (overnight in the refrigerator or a few hours in the freezer), otherwise it will be messy when you unmold it.

Make crust: Combine first 3 ingredients in processor and chop finely, using on/off turns. Transfer to bowl. Mix in butter. Press firmly into bottom and up sides (but not rim) of 10-inch glass pie plate. Freeze 15 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350°F. Bake crust until center is golden, covering edges with foil if browning too quickly, about 19 minutes. Cool 5 minutes. If edges have slipped, gently press into place. Cool almond crust completely.
Make filling: Soften ice cream in refrigerator until spreadable but not melted. Spread in crust. Smooth surface. Freeze until firm, at least 2 hours. (Can be prepared 3 days ahead. Cover tightly.)
Whip cream, sugar and cardamom until stiff peaks form. Spread over pie. Top with berries and serve.

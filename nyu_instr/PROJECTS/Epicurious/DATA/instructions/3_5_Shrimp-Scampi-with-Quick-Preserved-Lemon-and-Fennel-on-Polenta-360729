For polenta: Bring clam juice, 2 1/4 cups water, and cream to boil in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat. Gradually whisk in polenta. Reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer polenta until thick and tender, stirring constantly, 15 to 20 minutes. Add hot pepper sauce; season with salt and freshly ground pepper. Cover to keep warm (if polenta becomes firm, add 1/3 cup water and stir over low heat to loosen and rewarm).
For scampi: Heat oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle shrimp on 1 side with coarse salt and pepper. Add to skillet; sear 1 minute per side. Transfer shrimp to plate. Add fennel, tomatoes, shallots, preserved lemon, and garlic. Sauté until fennel is tender, about 4 minutes. Add Pernod; boil 1 minute. Add cream; boil 1 minute. Return shrimp to skillet. Toss until just opaque in center, about 1 minute.
Spoon polenta onto plates. Top with shrimp and sauce.

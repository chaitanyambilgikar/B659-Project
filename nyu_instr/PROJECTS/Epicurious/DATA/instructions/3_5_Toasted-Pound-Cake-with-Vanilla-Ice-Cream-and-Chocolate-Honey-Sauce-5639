Stir chocolate, butter and honey in top of double boiler set over simmering water until melted and smooth. (Sauce can be prepared 3 days ahead. Cool completely. Cover and refrigerate. Stir in top of double boiler until heated through before using.)
Working in batches, toast pound cake slices in electric toaster or on barbecue grill until golden. Generously brush both sides of cake slices with liqueur. Cut cake slices diagonally in half, forming triangles.
Drizzle warm chocolate-honey sauce on plates. Scoop ice cream atop sauce. Place 3 cake triangles on each plate. Sprinkle with pecans and orange peel and serve.

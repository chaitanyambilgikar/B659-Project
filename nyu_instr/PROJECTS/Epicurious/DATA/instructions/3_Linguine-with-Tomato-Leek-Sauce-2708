Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add leeks and bell pepper. Sauté until just beginning to soften, about 5 minutes. Add cauliflower, tomatoes and tarragon and cook until cauliflower is tender, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Pour sauce over pasta. Serve, passing Parmesan separately.

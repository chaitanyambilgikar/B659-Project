1. In a nonstick frying pan, toast the almonds over medium heat. Set aside.
2. Warm the olive oil and butter in the frying pan. Add the snapper skin-side up. Season with salt and pepper. Cook 4 minutes on each side. Transfer the fish to a warm serving plate and cover loosely with foil.
3. Add the lemon juice to the pan and whisk to blend with the pan juices. Pour over fillets, add the chopped parsley, and sprinkle with the toasted almonds. Serve immediately.

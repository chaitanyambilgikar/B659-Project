Fit enough bread slices in bottom of prepared dish to cover, trimming bread if necessary. Toss currants, raisins and cinnamon in small bowl. Sprinkle half of raisin mixture over bread in dish. Cover with another layer of bread slices, trimming to fit. Sprinkle remaining raisin mixture over.
In medium bowl, whisk eggs, milk, cream, sugar and nutmeg to blend. Pour mixture evenly over bread. Let stand 30 minutes, occasionally pressing down with metal spatula to submerge bread.

Cook potato in microwave until tender, about 5 minutes per side. Peel potato; mash enough to measure 1/4 cup (packed).
Place 1/4 cup mashed potato in bowl. Mix in 1/4 cup mayonnaise, mustard, vinegar, salt and pepper, then 1/4 cup basil, olives, capers and shallots. Add tuna and combine gently. Shape into four 1-inch-thick patties. Mix remaining cup mayonnaise and 1/4 cup basil in small bowl.
Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Spray both sides of burgers with nonstick spray; grill until just opaque in center, about 4 minutes per side.
Cut bread pieces lengthwise into thirds; discard centers. Spread basil mayonnaise on bottom halves. Top with burgers, tomatoes, lettuce and bread tops.

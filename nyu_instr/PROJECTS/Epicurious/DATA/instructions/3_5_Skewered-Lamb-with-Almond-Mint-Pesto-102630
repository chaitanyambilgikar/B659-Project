Finely chop almonds, cheese and garlic in processor. Add 1/3 cup oil and process to form paste. Add mint and basil and process until well blended and smooth. Mix in more oil if necessary to loosen mixture. Season pesto with salt and pepper.
Thread 1 strip of lamb onto each skewer. Arrange in single layer on baking sheet. Lightly brush lamb with oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Top pesto with 1/4-inch-thick layer of olive oil. Cover pesto and lamb separately and refrigerate. Spoon off oil from top of pesto before serving.) Preheat broiler. Broil lamb just until cooked through, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to platter. Serve with pesto.

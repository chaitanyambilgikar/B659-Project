Heat oven to 375°. Place four 8-ounce ramekins on a rimmed baking sheet and coat each with cooking spray. Place oats in a bowl and stir in 3 tablespoons boiling water; cover and steep about 10 minutes. Divide pears and cranberries among ramekins. Mix next 5 ingredients in a bowl. Stir egg and sugar into oats; add flour mixture and yogurt. Stir but don't overmix. Spoon batter over fruit and spray tops with cooking spray. Bake until topping browns and puffs, about 45 minutes. Serve warm.

For each serving, place 2 ounces of each melon in the center of the plate. Place 1/2 ounce prosciutto on top of the melon, followed by 8 micro basil leaves, 4 fig quarters, and a few rocket leaves.
Drizzle about 1 tablespoon olive oil on top and garnish with the shaved ricotta and a pinch of chile flakes.

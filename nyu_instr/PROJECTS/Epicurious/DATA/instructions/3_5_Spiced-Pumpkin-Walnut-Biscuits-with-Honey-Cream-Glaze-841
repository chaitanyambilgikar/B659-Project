Position rack in center of oven; preheat to 375°F. Butter heavy large baking sheet. Mix flour, baking powder, ginger, cinnamon, salt and cardamom in medium bowl to blend . Add butter and rub in with fingertips until mixture resembles coarse meal. Whisk pumpkin, 1/4 cup cream, brown sugar, 2 tablespoons honey and peel in another medium bowl to blend. Add pumpkin mixture and chopped nuts to dry ingredients and stir until incorporated (dough will be moist).
Turn dough out onto floured surface and knead gently until smooth, about 8 turns. Roll out dough to 3/4-inch thickness. Using floured 2-inch-diameter cookie cutter, cut out rounds. Reroll scraps to 3/4-inch thickness; cut out additional rounds. Place biscuits on prepared baking sheet, spacing evenly.
Whisk remaining 2 tablespoons cream and 2 tablespoons honey in small bowl. Brush atop biscuits. Garnish each with 1 walnut half. Bake biscuits until light golden and tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Transfer biscuits to rack and cool 15 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature. (Can be prepared 6 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature. If desired, wrap biscuits in foil and rewarm in 350°F. oven about 5 minutes.)

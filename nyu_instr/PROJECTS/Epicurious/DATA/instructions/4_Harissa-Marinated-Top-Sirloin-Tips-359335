Cut steak lengthwise in half, forming two 2- to 3-inch-wide strips. Cut each strip into 2- to 3-inch triangles. Combine 2 tablespoons olive oil, garlic, sugar, soy sauce, thyme, and 2 teaspoons harissa in large bowl; whisk to blend. Add beef; toss to coat evenly. Marinate 30 minutes at room temperature or cover and chill at least 2 hours and up to 1 day, tossing occasionally.
Drain beef. Heat 2 heavy large skillets over high heat. Brush skillets generously with olive oil. Divide beef tips between skillets. Cook until well browned on all sides, turning with tongs, 6 to 7 minutes for medium-rare. Transfer beef tips to platter.
Whisk remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, 1 tablespoon harissa, and 2 tablespoons water in small bowl to blend well. Season sauce to taste with salt. Drizzle sauce over beef tips and serve.
* A spicy North African red chile sauce; available in cans and jars at some specialty foods stores and at Middle Eastern markets.

Preheat oven to 400°F.
Stir together butter and oil. Arrange 1 phyllo sheet on a work surface with a long side of phyllo nearest you, keeping remaining sheet covered. Brush with some butter mixture and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon sugar. Top with remaining sheet of phyllo, then brush with remaining butter mixture and sprinkle with remaining teaspoon sugar.
Cut phyllo in half crosswise and stack. Cut stack into quarters and cut each quarter diagonally twice (in an X) to form 4 triangles (for a total of 16 triangles).
Arrange triangles, spaced evenly, on 2 ungreased baking sheets and sprinkle with coconut. Bake in middle and lower third of oven, switching position of sheets halfway through baking, until golden and crisp, 5 to 6 minutes total.

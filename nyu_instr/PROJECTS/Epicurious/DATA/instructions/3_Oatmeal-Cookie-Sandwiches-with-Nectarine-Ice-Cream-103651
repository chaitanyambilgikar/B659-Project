For cookies: Position 1 rack in top third and 1 rack in bottom third of oven and preheat to 350°F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
Mix first 5 ingredients in medium bowl. Using electric mixer, beat butter in large bowl until fluffy. Add both sugars; beat until well blended. Beat in egg and vanilla. Stir in dry ingredients. Using 2 tablespoons batter per cookie, drop 8 mounds onto each sheet, spacing mounds 3 inches apart. Flatten to 2-inch rounds.
Bake cookies 10 minutes. Reverse baking sheets and bake until cookies are golden and dry to touch, about 3 minutes longer. Let cool 2 minutes. Transfer cookies to rack. Cool completely. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Store airtight.)
For ice cream: Preheat oven to 375°F. Spray large rimmed baking sheet with nonstick spray. Spread nectarines in single layer on sheet. Sprinkle with sugar; toss to coat. Bake nectarines 15 minutes. Stir well. Bake until fruit is tender and juices begin to thicken and caramelize, stirring every 5 minutes to prevent burning, about 20 minutes longer. Transfer fruit and juices to large bowl; mash coarsely; cool. Mix ice cream into fruit. Freeze until almost firm, about 45 minutes.
Place 8 cookies, flat side up, on work surface. Spread 1/3 cup ice cream over each. Top each with 1 cookie, flat side down, and press gently to adhere (reserve any remaining ice cream for another use). Wrap sandwiches in foil and freeze. (Can be made 3 days ahead. Keep frozen.)

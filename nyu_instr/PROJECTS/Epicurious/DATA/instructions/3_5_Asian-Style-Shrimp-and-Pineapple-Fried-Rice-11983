Halve the pineapple lengthwise, cut out the flesh, leaving 1/2-inch-thick shells, and reserve the shells. Discard the core and cut enough of the pineapple into 1/2-inch pieces to measure 1 1/2 cups, reserving the remaining pineapple for another use. In a bowl combine the pineapple pieces, the bell pepper, the scallions, and the jalapeño pepper. In a small bowl whisk together the soy sauce, the sugar, the anchovy paste, the turmeric, and 1 tablespoon water.
In a wok or heavy skillet heat 1 tablespoon of the oil over moderately high heat until it is hot but not smoking, in it stir-fry the shrimp for 1 1/2 minutes, or until they are just firm, and transfer them to a bowl. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil over moderately high heat until it is hot but not smoking and in the oil stir-fry the garlic for 5 seconds, or until it is golden. Add the rice and stir-fry the mixture for 30 seconds, or until the rice is hot. Add the soy mixture and stir-fry the mixture for 1 minute. Add the pineapple mixture and the shrimp, stir-fry the mixture for 1 minute, or until it is hot, and stir in the coriander. Serve the fried rice in the reserved pineapple shells if desired. (There will be extra fried rice.)

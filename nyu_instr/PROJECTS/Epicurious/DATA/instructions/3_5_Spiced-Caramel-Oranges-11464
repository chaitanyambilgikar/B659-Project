In a heavy saucepan melt the sugar over moderate heat, stirring with a fork, and cook the syrup, swirling the pan occasionally, until it is a golden caramel. Remove the pan from the heat, pour the water carefully down the side of the pan, and add the cinnamon and the allspice. Return the pan to the heat and simmer the syrup until the caramel is dissolved. Remove the pan from the heat, add the rum carefully, and simmer the syrup for 5 minutes. Arrange the orange slices in a large bowl, pour the syrup over them, and let the oranges macerate, covered and chilled, for at least 2 hours or overnight. Serve the oranges at room temperature.

1. Place the potatoes in a medium stock pot and add enough cold water to cover by about 2 inches. Salt the water and bring it to a boil over moderately high heat. Cook the potatoes until easily pierced with a fork, 12 to 14 minutes, depending on the size of the potatoes. Drain the potatoes and dry them in the pot over low heat, about 3 minutes. Push the potatoes through a food mill or potato ricer onto a lightly floured work surface.
2. Gather the potatoes into a mound and make a well in the center. Sprinkle half the flour into the well and gently add in the eggs, egg yolk, and nutmeg. Mix the ingredients by hand until a soft dough forms. If necessary, add more flour, a little at a time, until the dough has a smooth, evenly moistened consistency.
3. Lightly flour your work surface and divide the dough into six or eight portions. Roll the portions into 1-inch-thick ropes and cut the ropes into 1-inch pieces. Roll the gnocchi over a fork to shape them, if desired. Once shaped, the gnocchi can be kept, on a floured baking sheet and loosely covered, in the refrigerator up to 8 hours.
4. When you're ready to serve the gnocchi, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the gnocchi and stir a few times to submerge and separate them. Cook at a gentle boil until the gnocchi are tender and just beginning to float, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain the gnocchi thoroughly and serve with a desired sauce or cheese.
Brown Butter-Sage Sauce: In a medium pot over medium-high heat, melt 3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter with 8 torn fresh sage leaves. Cook until the butter is slightly browned and smells nutty, 2 to 3 minutes. Place the gnocchi in a serving dish and sprinkle with 3/4 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Spoon the brown butter over the gnocchi and garnish with the sage leaves.

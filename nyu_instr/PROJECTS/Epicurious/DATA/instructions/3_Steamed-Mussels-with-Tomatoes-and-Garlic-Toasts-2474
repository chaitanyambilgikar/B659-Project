Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add 2 tablespoons garlic; sauté 2 minutes. Add tomatoes and parsley. Reduce heat; simmer until sauce thickens, stirring often, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add mussels; increase heat to high. Cover; cook until mussels open, about 7 minutes (discard any mussels that do not open).

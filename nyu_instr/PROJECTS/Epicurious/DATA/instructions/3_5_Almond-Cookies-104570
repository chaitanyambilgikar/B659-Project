Preheat oven to 350°F.
Coarsely chop almonds and pine nuts with sugar in a food processor. Lightly beat 2 whites and add to nuts with flour and salt. Blend until evenly moist. (Dough should be slightly sticky but firm enough to hold together. If it is too dry, lightly beat remaining egg white and blend into dough 1 teaspoon at a time.)
Drop heaping teaspoons about 1/2 inch apart onto a parchment paper–lined baking sheet. Gently squeeze each with your fingers to form a rough cone shape.
Bake cookies in middle of oven until barely browned and moist in center, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool 5 minutes on sheet, then transfer to a rack to cool completely.

Preheat oven to 400°F.
Cook broccoli rabe in boiling salted water 5 minutes, then drain in a colander.
Meanwhile, cook sausage meat in an ovenproof heavy skillet (preferably cast-iron) over moderately high heat, breaking up meat with a spoon, until browned and crisp. Transfer with a slotted spoon to a large bowl.
Add oil and garlic to skillet and cook over moderate heat, stirring, until garlic is golden, about 1 minute. Add broccoli rabe and cook, stirring, 3 minutes. Add salt, then pepper to taste. Add to sausage with spaghetti, cheese, and eggs. Toss well and spoon mixture into skillet, spreading to smooth top.
Bake in middle of oven until center is set but still moist, 20 to 25 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes before cutting into wedges.

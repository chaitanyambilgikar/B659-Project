Stir together miso, ginger, cilantro and 1 tbsp shallot in a bowl. Coat each fillet with mixture; cover and refrigerate 6 hours. Bring fava beans, broth, 1/2 cup shallots and thyme to a boil in a medium saucepan. Lower heat; simmer until beans are very tender, about 10 minutes. (If using peas, simmer 5 minutes.) Drain excess broth, leaving just enough to cover beans. Stir in butter; season with salt and pepper. Remove cod from marinade. Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet. Cook cod until well browned and firm, turning once, about 4 minutes per side. Using a slotted spoon, divide fava beans among 4 plates; top with cod. Serve immediately.

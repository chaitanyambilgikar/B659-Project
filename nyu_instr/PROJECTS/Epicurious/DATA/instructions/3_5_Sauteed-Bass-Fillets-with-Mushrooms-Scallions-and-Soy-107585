Cut white and pale green parts of scallions diagonally into 1 1/2-inch pieces. Thinly slice enough scallion greens to measure 1/4 cup, reserving remainder for another use.
Stir together soy, mirin, and water.
Pat fish dry and season with salt. Heat oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then sauté fish, turning once, until golden and almost cooked through, about 4 minutes total. Transfer fish to a serving dish and keep warm, loosely covered with foil. (Fish will continue to cook as it stands.)
Add mushrooms, scallion pieces, and soy mixture to skillet and boil over moderately high heat, stirring, until mushrooms are tender and sauce is slightly thickened, 7 to 8 minutes. Add fish juices that have accumulated in serving dish to skillet and boil 1 minute. Spoon sauce over fish and sprinkle with scallion greens.

Brown the chicken pieces in the butter, turning each piece to color evenly. When nearly browned, add 2 tablespoons chopped onion and cook gently until onion and chicken are brown and blended. Add salt to taste, garlic, and chilis. Pour over this mixture 2/3 cup white wine and simmer gently until chicken is tender. Remove chicken to a hot platter, pour pan juices over it and garnish with chopped toasted almonds. Serve with polenta.

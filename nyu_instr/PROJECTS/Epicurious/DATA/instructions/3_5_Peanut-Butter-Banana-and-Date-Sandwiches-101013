Lightly toast pita breads; cut each in half crosswise. Open pita pockets. Spread 2 tablespoons peanut butter on 1 side of the inside of each pita pocket. Sprinkle chopped dates over peanut butter, dividing equally. Drizzle honey over. Divide banana slices among pita pockets; close sandwiches, pressing slightly to adhere.

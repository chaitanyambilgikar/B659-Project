Pull carcass into large pieces. Combine carcass, water, and thyme in a 7- to 10-quart pot and simmer, uncovered, skimming froth, 3 hours. Discard large bones with a slotted spoon or tongs, then pour broth through a large sieve into a large bowl.
If broth measures less than 12 cups, add water. If not, boil, uncovered, in cleaned pot until reduced to 12 cups. If using broth right away, let stand until fat rises to top, 1 to 2 minutes, then skim off and discard fat. If not using broth right away, cool, uncovered, then chill, covered, before skimming fat (it will be easier to remove when cool or cold).
Heat oil in cleaned and dried pot over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then cook onions, carrots, and celery, stirring occasionally, until onions are golden, 10 to 12 minutes.
Add broth and simmer, uncovered, until vegetables are just tender, about 10 minutes. Add noodles, peas, and turkey and simmer, stirring occasionally, until noodles are tender, about 10 minutes.

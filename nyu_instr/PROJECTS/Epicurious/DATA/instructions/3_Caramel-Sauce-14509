In a heavy skillet cook the sugar over moderately high heat, stirring constantly with a fork, until it is melted completely and turns a deep golden caramel. Remove the skillet from the heat, stir the caramel to prevent further darkening, and pour the cream into the side of the skillet carefully (the caramel will harden when the cream is added). Add 2 tablespoons water and cook the caramel mixture over moderate heat, stirring, until the caramel is dissolved. Let the sauce cool to warm.

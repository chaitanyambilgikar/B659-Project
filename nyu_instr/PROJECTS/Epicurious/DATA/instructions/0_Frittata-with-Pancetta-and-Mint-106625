Heat olive oil in large nonstick broilerproof skillet over medium heat. Add pancetta and onion and sauté until onion is soft, about 10 minutes.
Preheat broiler. Whisk eggs, 1/4 cup water, salt, and pepper in medium bowl to blend. Pour eggs into skillet with onion and pancetta. Stir 1 minute. Add 1/2 cup chopped mint; stir 30 seconds. Reduce heat to low and cook without stirring until almost set, about 10 minutes.
Broil frittata just until firm, about 1 minute. Using spatula as aid, transfer frittata to serving platter. Sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoons chopped mint. Cut frittata into wedges and serve.
* Pancetta, Italian bacon cured in salt, is available at Italian markets and in the deli case at many supermarkets.

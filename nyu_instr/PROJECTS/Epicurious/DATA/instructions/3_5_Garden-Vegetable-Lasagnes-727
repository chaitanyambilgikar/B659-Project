Preheat oven to 450°F. Simmer marinara sauce, tomatoes, zucchini and basil in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat until zucchini is tender, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes.
Meanwhile, mix ricotta cheese and 6 tablespoons Parmesan cheese in bowl to blend; season with salt and pepper. Cook lasagne noodles in pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite; drain. Cut noodles in half crosswise, making 6 pieces.
Set aside 2 tablespoons vegetable sauce for topping. Place 2 noodle pieces in buttered 8x8x2-inch glass baking dish, spacing apart. Spread 1/4 of cheese mixture, then 1/4 of sauce over each. Repeat layering of noodle pieces, cheese mixture and sauce. Top each with another noodle piece, 1 tablespoon reserved sauce, then 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese.
Bake lasagnes uncovered until heated through, about 10 minutes. Serve with additional Parmesan cheese.

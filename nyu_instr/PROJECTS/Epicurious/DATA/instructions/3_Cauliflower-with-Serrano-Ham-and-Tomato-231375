Cook cauliflower in a large pot of boiling salted water until just tender, 4 to 6 minutes. Drain well in a colander, then transfer to a large bowl.
While cauliflower boils, cook onion in oil in a 10-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, 2 minutes. Add tomatoes and ham and cook, stirring frequently, until just heated through, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in lemon juice and parsley.
Pour tomato mixture over cauliflower and toss to coat, then season with salt and pepper. Serve warm or at room temperature.

Preheat the oven to 375°F.
Melt the 2/3 cup butter in a saucepan over low heat. Set it aside.
Grease a baking sheet with the remaining 1 teaspoon butter.
On a floured surface, unroll the dough, cut it into six equal squares, and transfer the squares to the baking sheet.
Cover each square with 1/2 cup of the berries or with enough pear or apple slices, attractively overlapping, to blanket all but the pastry edges.
Using a basting brush or a spoon, paint the fruit with melted butter, and then sprinkle each square with 2 tablespoons of the sugar.
Pop them into the oven and bake for 20 minutes, or until the pastry is golden and the fruit is tender.
Serve with ice cream and a decorative drizzle of caramel sauce, and your guests will think you graduated from the Culinary Academy.

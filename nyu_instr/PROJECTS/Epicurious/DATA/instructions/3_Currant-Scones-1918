Preheat oven to 425°F. Lightly flour large baking sheet. Mix 3 cups flour, sugar, baking soda and salt in large bowl. Add butter and rub in with fingertips until mixture resembles fine meal. Mix in currants. Mix in egg and enough buttermilk to form soft dough. Turn dough out onto floured surface. Pat dough into 3/4-inch-thick round. Cut out rounds, using 2 1/2-inch round cookie cutter. Gather scraps, press together and pat out to 3/4-inch-thick round. Cut out additional rounds.
Transfer scones to prepared baking sheet. Brush tops with milk. Bake until scones are golden brown and cooked through, about 18 minutes. Serve warm with butter or whipped cream and jam.

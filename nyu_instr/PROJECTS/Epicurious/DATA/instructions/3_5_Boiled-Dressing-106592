Whisk eggs with flour, sugar, salt, and mustard in a 1-quart heavy saucepan, then gradually whisk in milk and vinegar. Cook over moderately low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until very thick and mixture registers 160°F on an instant-read thermometer. (Do not let boil.) Pour through sieve into a metal bowl, then stir in butter until melted.
Put bowl in a larger bowl of ice and cold water and cool, stirring occasionally. Cover surface of dressing with wax paper and chill.

In a skillet heat the oil until it is hot but not smoking and in it sauté the livers, patted dry, and the onion over moderately high heat until the liver is no longer pink within. Transfer the mixture to a food processor, add the egg and salt and pepper to taste, and blend the mixture until it is smooth. Serve the chopped liver with the black bread.

Sprinkle fish on both sides with salt and pepper, then with 1 teaspoon garam masala, dividing equally. Melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add fish and cook until opaque in center, about 2 1/2 minutes per side. Transfer fish to platter (do not clean skillet).
Add tomatoes with juices, 2 tablespoons cilantro, and remaining 2 teaspoons garam masala to same skillet. Simmer over medium-low heat until slightly thickened, scraping up any browned bits, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Spoon sauce over fish. Top with yogurt and sprinkle with cilantro.

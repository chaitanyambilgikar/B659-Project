Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter 13x9x2-inch glass baking dish. Place bread cubes in large bowl. Pour broth over; let stand until bread absorbs most of broth.
Melt butter in heavy large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onions, celery and bell pepper and sauté until vegetables are tender but not brown, about 15 minutes. Mix in almonds, poultry seasoning and sage and sauté 5 minutes longer. Mix in apricots. Add vegetable to bread mixture; season to taste with salt and pepper. Cool 15 minutes. Mix eggs into stuffing. Transfer stuffing to prepared dish.
Bake stuffing until golden on top and cooked through, about 1 hour.

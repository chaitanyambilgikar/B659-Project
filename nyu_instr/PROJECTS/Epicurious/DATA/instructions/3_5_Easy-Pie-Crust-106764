1. Combine the flour, sugar and salt in a food processor; pulse on and off to mix. Add the butter and pulse the machine on and off until the mixture resembles coarse meal.
2. With the machine running, trickle in the ice water through the feed tube, just until the dough gathers together. (If the dough seems dry, add up to 1 tablespoon more water, 1/2 teaspoon at a time.) Remove the dough from the machine and divide it in half. Flatten each half with the palm of your hand to form a thick disk. Wrap the 2 disks in plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour.
3. Use the dough as directed for a single- or double-crust pie: Remove one disk of dough from the refrigerator. Unwrap it and roll it out on a lightly floured work surface or between 2 sheets of waxed paper to form a circle about 1/8-inch thick and 2 inches larger than the pie plate. Work quickly, as the dough can become sticky. Use a spatula to help lift the dough and fold it loosely in half and then into quarters. Gently transfer it to the pie plate, centering the corner of the dough in the center of the plate. Open up the dough and press it lightly into the plate to fit. If the dough should tear, just press it gently together. Trim the dough, leaving a 1-inch overhang. If making a single-crust pie, turn the edge under and flute it decoratively.
4. Repeat the rolling process to make a top crust or another bottom crust. The circle for a top crust should be 9 inches for an 8-inch pie; it should be 10 inches for a 9-inch pie.
5. Follow the individual pie (or tart) recipes for filling and baking.

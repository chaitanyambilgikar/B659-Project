Thread 2 blocks of cheese lengthwise onto each skewer, then cover skewers with cold water and soak 1 hour.
Stir together oil and oregano in a 13- by 9-inch shallow dish.
While cheese soaks, prepare grill for cooking. If using a charcoal grill, open vents on bottom of grill, then light charcoal. Charcoal fire is medium-hot when you can hold your hand 5 inches above rack for 3 to 4 seconds. If using a gas grill, preheat burners on high, covered, 10 minutes, then reduce heat to moderately high.
Drain cheese skewers on paper towels and pat dry, then grill, covered only if using a gas grill, on a well-oiled grill rack, turning (use a metal spatula to scrape under cheese to loosen before turning each time), until evenly browned, 3 to 7 minutes total.
Add cheese skewers to oregano oil and turn to coat.

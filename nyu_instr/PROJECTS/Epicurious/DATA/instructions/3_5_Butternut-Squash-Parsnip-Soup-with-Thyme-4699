Preheat oven to 375°F. Butter large roasting pan with 1 tablespoon butter. Arrange squash pieces, skin side up, in prepared roasting pan. Add parsnips and 1/4 cup water to pan. Cover pan with foil; bake until vegetables are very tender, about 50 minutes. Cool vegetables.
Meanwhile, melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in heavy large skillet over medium-low heat. Add onion and thyme; sauté until onion is tender and golden, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat.
Scrape squash pulp into processor (discard peels); add parsnips and onion mixture. Puree until smooth. Mix in broth. Transfer mixture to heavy large saucepan. Whisk in half and half. Bring to simmer. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Rewarm before serving.)

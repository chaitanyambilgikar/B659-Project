Melt butter in large skillet over medium heat; sprinkle sugar over. Stir until sugar begins to melt, about 1 minute. Add apples. Sauté until apples are brown and tender and juices form, about 10 minutes. Add cream and simmer until sauce thickens slightly, about 2 minutes. (Can be prepared 3 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature. Rewarm apples over medium heat.)

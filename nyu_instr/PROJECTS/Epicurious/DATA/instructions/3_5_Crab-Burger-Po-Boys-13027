Make mustard mayonnaise: In a bowl whisk together mayonnaise ingredients and reserve.
Make crab burgers: In a small heavy skillet cook onion and bell pepper in butter over moderately low heat, stirring occasionally, until softened. In a bowl stir together onion mixture, crab meat, scallion greens, mayonnaise, egg, 1 tablespoon bread crumbs, Worcestershire sauce, cayenne, and salt to taste.
Put remaining 1/2 cup bread crumbs in a small bowl and put a piece of plastic wrap on a work surface. Form one fourth crab mixture into a 3-inch patty (it will be soft) and coat with bread crumbs, transferring to plastic wrap. Make 3 more patties in same manner with remaining crab mixture and bread crumbs.
In a 10-inch heavy deep skillet heat 1/4 inch oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and fry patties until golden and cooked through, about 2 1/2 minutes on each side, transferring to paper towels to drain.
Spread bread with reserved mustard mayonnaise and sandwich crab burgers and lettuce between bread.

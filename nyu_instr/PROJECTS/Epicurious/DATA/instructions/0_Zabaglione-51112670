1. In a heat-safe bowl set over barely simmering water, combine the egg yolks, sugar, and Marsala. Whisk constantly until the mixture is thick and glossy, 5 to 7 minutes.
2. Serve at once as a warm custard with cookies or fruit.
Serving Suggestion: For a cold dessert, transfer the bowl of cooked zabaglione to an ice bath and stir occasionally until the mixture is cool. Transfer to the refrigerator and chill completely, about 1 hour. Whip 1 cup of heavy cream to medium peaks and fold the whipped cream into the zabaglione. Spoon into molds or glasses and serve as a mousse.

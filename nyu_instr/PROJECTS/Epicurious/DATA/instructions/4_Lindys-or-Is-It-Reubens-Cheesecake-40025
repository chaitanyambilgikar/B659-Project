1. To make the crust, place the flour, sugar, grated lemon rind, vanilla extract, egg yolk, and butter in a large mixing bowl. With your fingertips, rub the ingredients together until they are well mixed and can be gathered into a ball. Dust with a little flour, wrap in waxed paper, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
2. Place the chilled dough in an ungreased 9-inch spring-form pan. With your hands, pat and spread the dough evenly over the bottom and about 2 inches up the side of the pan. Bake in the center of a preheated 450-degree oven for 10 minutes. Remove and set aside to cool to room temperature.
3. Lower the oven temperature to 200 degrees. To make the filling, place the cream cheese in a large mixing bowl and beat vigorously with a wooden spoon until it is creamy and smooth. Beat in the sugar, a few tablespoons at a time, and, when it is well incorporated, beat in the flour, lemon and orange rinds, vanilla extract, eggs and egg yolk, and heavy cream.
4. Pour the filling into the cooled cookie crust and bake in the center of the oven for 1 hour. Then remove from the oven and set aside to cool in the pan. Then demold.
5. Refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 3 hours before serving.

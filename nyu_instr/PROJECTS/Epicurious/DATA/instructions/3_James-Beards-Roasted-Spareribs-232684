Preheat oven to 350°F.
Preparing and Roasting the Ribs Rub the ribs with salt and pepper on both sides.
Set a roasting or broiler rack in a roasting pan. Arrange the ribs on the rack, meaty side facing up.
Put the pan on the center rack of the oven and bake for 30 minutes. Using a pair of tongs, turn the ribs over, and cook for another 30 minutes.
When the second 30 minutes are up, the ribs should be nicely browned and fairly crisp on the outside. If not, roast for another 10 minutes and check again.
Cutting and Serving the Ribs When you are serving the ribs, cut the rack into separate racks of 3 or 4 ribs per person and place on a platter or plates. Serve hot.

Stir first 4 ingredients in large bowl until both sugars dissolve. Add salmon, skin side up, to brine, pressing to submerge. Cover and refrigerate overnight.Remove salmon from brine; discard brine. Rinse salmon under cold water. Place salmon, skin side down, on rack. Let stand until top is dry to touch (do not pat dry), about 1 hour.
Prepare barbecue (medium-low heat). Using 2 layers of foil, make 12 x 10-inch foil rectangle with 1-inch-high sides. Place 3 cups smoke chips on foil rectangle. Set atop coals 5 minutes before grilling salmon. Position barbecue rack at least 6 inches above briquettes. Position vents on barbecue so that chips smoke and briquettes burn but do not flame.
Using 3 layers of foil, make another 12 x 10-inch foil rectangle with 1-inch-high sides. Using skewer, pierce 6 holes evenly over bottom of rectangle. Arrange salmon, skin side down, on rectangle. Place salmon on foil on grill. Cover; cook until salmon is firm to touch and glaze forms over salmon, adding more smoke chips to barbecue if necessary, 30 minutes to 1 hour, depending on heat of grill.
Remove salmon from foil, leaving skin on foil. Transfer salmon to platter; serve warm or at room temperature. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover; chill. Bring to room temperature before serving.)

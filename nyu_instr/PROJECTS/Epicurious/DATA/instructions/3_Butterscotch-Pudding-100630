In a saucepan heat cream over moderately low heat until warm. While cream is heating, in a 3-quart heavy saucepan melt butter over moderate heat and stir in brown sugar. Cook sugar mixture, stirring occasionally, until mixture is bubbling all over and appears smooth, about 5 minutes. Carefully add warm cream (mixture will bubble and steam) and cook over moderately low heat, stirring, until sugar mixture is dissolved, about 1 minute. Remove pan from heat.
In a large metal bowl or top of a double boiler whisk together milk, yolks, cornstarch, and salt. Add warm butterscotch mixture in a slow stream, whisking constantly, and set bowl or top of double boiler over a saucepan of simmering water. Cook pudding, whisking constantly, 10 minutes, or until it begins to thicken. Cover bowl or top of double boiler and cook pudding, whisking occasionally, 10 minutes more.
Remove bowl or top of double boiler from pan and cool pudding 5 minutes, whisking occasionally. Divide hot pudding among six 1-cup ramekins or other heatproof dishes. Chill puddings, covered (if you don't want skins to form) or uncovered (if you do want skins to form), until cold, at least 3 hours, and up to 2 days. Serve puddings topped with whipped cream.

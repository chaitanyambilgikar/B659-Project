For cake: Preheat oven to 375°F. Butter and flour 8x8x2-inch baking pan. Mix flour, baking powder and salt in small bowl. Coarsely chop enough chestnuts to measure 1 cup. Set aside. Finely mash remaining chestnuts with fork in medium bowl. Add 3/4 cup brown sugar, butter, maple syrup and vanilla to mashed chestnuts. Using electric mixer, beat until well blended. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in flour mixture. Stir in half of chopped chestnuts. Spread batter in prepared pan. Sprinkle with remaining chopped chestnuts, then remaining 1 tablespoon brown sugar.
Bake cake until tester inserted into center comes out with some moist crumbs attached, about 22 minutes. Cool cake in pan on rack.
For icing: Stir powdered sugar, butter, 3 tablespoons maple syrup and maple extract, if desired, to blend in small bowl. Thin with remaining maple syrup, 1 teaspoon at a time, until icing is smooth and forms thick ribbons when poured. Spread icing over cool cake. Let stand until icing is set, about 20 minutes. Cut cake into squares. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.)

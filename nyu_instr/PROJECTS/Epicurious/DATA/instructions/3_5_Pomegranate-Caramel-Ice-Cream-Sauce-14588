Cut pomegranates in half and with a manual citrus juicer squeeze enough juice from 2 halves, pressing sides against center of juicer and pressing on any whole seeds in juicer with thumbs, to measure 2/3 cup.
With hands gently break remaining 2 pomegranate halves in two. Bend back rinds and dislodge seeds from membranes.
In a dry 1 1/2-quart heavy saucepan cook sugar over moderately low heat, stirring slowly with a fork (to help sugar melt evenly), until melted and pale golden. Cook caramel, without stirring, swirling pan, until deep golden. Add pomegranate juice (caramel will steam and harden) and cook overt moderately low heat, stirring, until caramel is dissolved. In a small bowl stir together water and arrowroot and stir into caramel mixture.

Stir pomegranate seeds into sauce. (Sauce may be made 2 days ahead and chilled, covered.)

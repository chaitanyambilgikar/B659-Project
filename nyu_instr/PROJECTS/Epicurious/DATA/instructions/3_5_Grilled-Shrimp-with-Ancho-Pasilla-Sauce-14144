Soak skewers in water at least 30 minutes and up to several hours.
Shell and devein shrimp. Holding 2 skewers parallel and slightly apart, thread 6 shrimp onto them (this will facilitate turning them on the grill). Thread remaining shrimp onto pairs of skewers in same manner. Brush both sides of shrimp with ancho pasilla sauce and discard any remaining sauce. Marinate shrimp, covered and chilled, at least 30 minutes and up to 6 hours.
Prepare grill.
Grill shrimp on a well-oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals 2 minutes on each side, or until just cooked through. (Alternatively, shrimp may be broiled on rack of a broiler pan under a preheated broiler about 3 inches from heat 3 to 4 minutes on each side.)
Remove shrimp from skewers and serve with accompaniments.

Spray 2 large rimmed baking sheets with nonstick spray. Position 1 rack in top third and 1 rack in bottom third of oven and preheat to 375°F. Combine carrots, parsnips, garlic, lemon slices, and 4 tablespoons oil in large bowl. Sprinkle with 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and toss to coat evenly. Divide mixture between prepared sheets, spreading in single layer. Roast vegetables 20 minutes. Stir vegetables; reverse positions of sheets. Roast until vegetables are tender and brown at edges, about 20 minutes longer.
Transfer vegetables to platter. Drizzle with remaining 2 tablespoons oil; sprinkle with parsley. Season with pepper and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Serve warm or at room temperature.

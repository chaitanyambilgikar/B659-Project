In a food processor pulse whole almonds with 1/2 cup sugar until ground fine. In a large bowl with a pastry blender or with your fingertips blend butter and flour until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add remaining 3/4 cup sugar, almond mixture, whole egg, zest, cinnamon, and cloves and stir until mixture forms a smooth dough. (Work dough well by hand if necessary.) Chill dough, wrapped in plastic wrap, at least 2 hours and up to 1 day.
Line baking sheets with foil.
Divide dough into 4 pieces. Lightly flour 1 piece of dough, keeping remaining dough chilled and wrapped in plastic wrap, and on a lightly floured surface roll out dough 1/4 inch thick. With a 1 1/2- to 2-inch cutter cut out cookies, chilling scraps, and arrange about 1/2 inch apart on baking sheets. Make more cookies with 3 remaining pieces of dough and scraps, pressed together, in same manner. Let cookies stand, uncovered, at room temperature at least 4 hours and up to 12.
Preheat oven to 350°F.
Brush cookies lightly with egg wash and sprinkle with blanched almonds. Bake cookies in batches in lower third of oven 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden, and cool on racks. Cookies keep in an airtight container at room temperature 2 weeks.

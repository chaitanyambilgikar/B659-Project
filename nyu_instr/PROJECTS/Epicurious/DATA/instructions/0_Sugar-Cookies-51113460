1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Lightly spray cookie sheets with cooking spray or line them with parchment paper. In a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat together the butter and sugar until light in texture and smooth, about 2 minutes. While that mixture is beating, sift the flours, salt, and baking soda into a bowl and set aside.
2. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg, egg yolk, vanilla, lemon juice, and lemon zest. Add this to the butter-sugar mixture and blend until incorporated. Scrape down the bowl as necessary to blend evenly. With the mixer on low or using a wooden spoon, stir in the sifted dry ingredients.
3. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and divide into two even pieces. Flatten each piece to about 1 inch thick and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate until chilled and firm, at least 2 hours.
4. Gently knead the chilled dough to make it more pliable. Lightly flour a work surface and rolling pin and, rotating the dough consistently and working with even pressure, roll out to about an 1/8-inch thickness. Cut the dough into the desired shape and transfer to the prepared baking sheets. Garnish the cookies with sanding sugar.
5. Bake the cookies in batches until they have a light golden-brown edge with a pale-blond center, about 10 minutes. Transfer to wire racks and let cool completely.

Puree 2 baskets raspberries, preserves and 2 tablespoons brandy in blender. Strain into small bowl, pressing on solids.
Stir 2 baskets blueberries, sugar, 1/4 cup water and lemon juice in heavy small saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to low; simmer until sauce thickens slightly, about 10 minutes. Strain sauce into another small bowl. (Sauces can be made 3 days ahead. Cover separately; chill.)
Beat whipping cream, powdered sugar and 1 1/2 tablespoons brandy in medium bowl until stiff peaks form. Chill until ready to use, up to 3 hours.
Place 3 scoops of ice cream in each of 6 bowls. Top with remaining fresh berries. Drizzle with raspberry and blueberry sauces. Pipe or spoon whipped cream atop sundaes.

Preheat oven to 425°F.
Pit apricots and cut into 1/2-inch-thick wedges. In a bowl toss with 1 tablespoon brown sugar. Divide apricots between two 1-cup ramekins or gratin dishes. Cut butter into small pieces and in a large bowl with your fingertips or a pastry blender blend into flour until mixture resembles coarse meal. Stir in remaining 3 tablespoons brown sugar, oats, salt, and cinnamon. Mound oat mixture on top of apricots and bake in middle of oven until topping is golden and apricots are tender, about 25 minutes.

Melt butter with oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add chicken and brown on both sides, about 5 minutes. Transfer to plate. Add onion and garlic to skillet and sauté until translucent, about 6 minutes. Stir in curry powder. Return chicken to skillet. Add apple, apricots and raisins. Add enough broth to just cover mixture. Season with salt. Cover and simmer until chicken is just cooked through, about 10 minutes. Transfer chicken to platter. Keep warm. Continue simmering fruit mixture until fruit is tender and sauce thickens, about 5 minutes. Spoon over chicken and serve with rice.

Cook sliced scallion in 2 teaspoons oil in a small heavy saucepan over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until pale golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in scallion greens.
Whisk eggs in a bowl until combined well, then whisk in water. Stir in matzo meal, salt, pepper, and scallion mixture until combined well.
Heat 1/2 cup oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderate heat until hot. Working in batches of 4, fill a 1/4-cup measure three-fourths full (3 tablespoons) for each pancake, then drop batter carefully into hot oil and spread with back of a spoon to form a 3-inch round. Cook pancakes until undersides are golden, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Turn over with a slotted spatula and cook until undersides are golden, about 1 1/2 minutes more. Transfer to a large rack set on a paper-towel-lined baking sheet. Add some of remaining 1/4 cup oil as needed between batches.

Stir crème de cassis, 1/2 cup water and sugar in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Bring to boil. Add dried cherries. Reduce heat; cover and simmer until cherries are plump, about 5 minutes. Mix in pecans and orange peel. Season relish lightly with salt. Transfer to bowl. Cool. (Can be made 1 week ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
Place ham or turkey on platter. Place bowl with cherry relish alongside. Serve with dinner rolls, if desired.

Cut 2 1/2 cups grapes in half; place in bowl. Add 1/3 cup grappa. Let stand at least 3 hours, stirring occasionally.
Purée remaining 1 1/2 cups grapes in processor. Transfer to strainer set over bowl. Press on solids in strainer to extract as much liquid as possible; discard solids in strainer. Transfer 1/2 cup grape juice to medium bowl (reserve any remaining juice for another use). Add remaining 2 tablespoons grappa, mascarpone, powdered sugar and 2 1/2 teaspoons lemon peel to bowl with grape juice; whisk until well blended. (Grapes and sweetened mascarpone can be made 1 day ahead. Cover separately and chill.)
Divide mascarpone mixture among 6 glasses. Top with grape mixture. Sprinkle with remaining 1 teaspoon lemon peel and serve.

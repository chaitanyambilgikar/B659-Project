In a 9-inch microwave-safe baking dish stir together the carrots, the soy sauce, the lemon juice, the sugar, and 1/4 cup water and microwave the mixture at high power (100%) for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the carrots are just tender. Add the butter and pepper to taste and toss the mixture until the butter is melted.

Combine milk and cinnamon stick in medium saucepan. Bring to simmer. Remove from heat. Cover; let stand 30 minutes. Discard cinnamon stick.
Preheat oven to 350°F. Divide orange strips among four 3/4-cup custard cups or soufflé dishes. Stir 1/2 cup sugar and 1/4 cup water in heavy small saucepan over low heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat and boil without stirring until syrup turns deep amber, occasionally brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush and swirling pan, about 8 minutes. Immediately pour caramel into custard cups, dividing equally.
Whisk egg, egg white, vanilla and remaining 1/3 cup sugar in medium bowl to blend. Gradually whisk in milk mixture. Pour over caramel in custard cups.
Place custard cups in roasting pan. Pour enough hot water into pan to come halfway up sides of cups. Bake until custards are set, about 1 hour 5 minutes. Remove from water. Chill overnight.
Run small knife around custards to loosen. Invert custards onto plates.

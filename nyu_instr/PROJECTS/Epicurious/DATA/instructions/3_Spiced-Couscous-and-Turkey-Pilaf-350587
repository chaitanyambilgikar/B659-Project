Cook onion in oil in a 4-quart heavy pot over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 10 minutes. Add couscous and spices and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add water, chickpeas, currants, and 1 teaspoon salt and simmer, covered, until couscous is just tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in turkey and let stand, covered, until heated through, about 5 minutes. Stir in mint.

Place spareribs in pot large enough to hold ribs in single layer. Add enough cold water to cover ribs. Bring to boil, spooning off any foam that rises to surface. Boil 1 minute. Transfer ribs to colander; rinse under cold water. Drain.
Wash and dry same pot. Add 3/4 cup water, sugar, ginger, 2 tablespoons soy sauce, rice wine, dark soy sauce, vinegar, ketchup, and salt to pot. Stir over medium-high heat until sugar dissolves. Add spareribs to pot, turning to coat with sauce mixture (sauce will not cover ribs). Arrange spareribs in single layer in pot; bring to boil. Reduce heat to low; cover and simmer until ribs are very tender, turning ribs occasionally and adding a few tablespoons water as needed to maintain liquid level, about 2 hours. DO AHEAD Can be made 1 day ahead. Chill uncovered until cold, then cover and keep chilled. Rewarm over medium heat.
Transfer ribs to platter. Boil sauce in pot until reduced to generous 1/2 cup, about 5 minutes. Pour sauce over spareribs and serve.

For chive oil: Combine oil and chives in blender and puree until smooth. Season chive oil to taste with salt and pepper.
For swordfish and corn: Cook corn in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender, about 8 minutes. Using tongs, remove corn from cooking liquid. Place on plate; reserve 1/2 cup corn cooking liquid. Cut corn kernels from cobs and reserve 4 cups (save remaining corn for another use).
Preheat oven to 350°F. Combine oil, lemon, crushed garlic, and rosemary in medium ovenproof pot. Attach deep-fry thermometer to side of pot; heat oil to 150°F. Carefully lower swordfish into oil. Transfer pot to oven; poach fish uncovered until just firm to touch, about 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add guanciale; sauté until almost crisp, 2 to 3 minutes. Add minced garlic and shallot; sauté until soft but not brown, about 3 minutes. Stir in reserved 4 cups corn and crushed red pepper. Add butter and 2 tablespoons reserved corn cooking liquid; stir until mixture is moist and creamy, adding more cooking liquid by tablespoonfuls if dry, about 5 minutes. Stir in chives and thyme. Season with sea salt and pepper.
Divide corn among 4 shallow bowls. Top each with swordfish steak. Sprinkle with sea salt; drizzle with chive oil.
What to drink:An aromatic, medium-bodied white—like the Alois Lageder 2009 "Vogelmaier" Moscato Giallo (Italy, $29)— would be perfect.

Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite. Drain, reserving 1/3 cup cooking water.
Meanwhile, heat oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Add garlic and crushed red pepper and sauté 1 minute. Add tomatoes with juices and wine; bring to boil. Boil until sauce thickens, about 8 minutes. Stir in basil. Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.
Add pasta and 1/2 cup cheese to sauce and toss until cheese melts and sauce coats pasta, adding reserved water by tablespoonfuls to moisten if necessary, about 3 minutes. Season pasta to taste with salt and pepper. Serve, passing remaining 1/2 cup cheese separately.

In a cleaned electric coffee/spice grinder finely grind anise seeds. In a bowl whisk together anise, flour, and salt and whisk in milk. In a small bowl whisk together eggs and sugar until combined and whisk egg mixture into flour mixture until just combined. (Overmixing will cause blisters on pastries.)
In a 3-quart heavy kettle heat 2 inches oil over moderate heat until a deep-fat thermometer registers 370°F. Put rosette iron in hot oil 20 seconds and carefully lift iron, letting excess oil drip into kettle. Dip bottom and side of oiled iron into batter 3 seconds, being careful not to let batter get onto top of iron. Immerse coated iron in oil and fry until pastry is golden and crisp, about 30 seconds. Lift iron, letting excess oil drip into kettle and, using a fork, loosen pastry, letting it drop onto brown paper or paper towels. Turn pastry over and drain on paper. Make more pastries in same manner, returning oil to 370°F. between batches and heating iron in hot oil each time 10 seconds before dipping into batter. (Pastries may be made 2 days ahead and chilled, layered between paper towels, in an airtight container. Before serving, reheat pastries in one layer on a baking sheet in a 225°F. oven 10 minutes.)
Dust pastries with confectioners' sugar.

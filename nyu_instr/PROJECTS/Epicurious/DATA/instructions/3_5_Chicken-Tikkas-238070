Stir together all ingredients except chicken in a medium bowl, then add chicken, stirring to coat. Marinate, covered and chilled, 30 minutes to 1 hour.
Prepare a grill for direct-heat cooking over medium-hot charcoal (moderately high heat for gas).
While grill is heating, thread 3 or 4 pieces of chicken onto each skewer, leaving a little space between pieces, and transfer to a tray lined with plastic wrap.
Oil grill rack, then grill chicken, covered only if using a gas grill, turning occasionally, until browned and just cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes total.

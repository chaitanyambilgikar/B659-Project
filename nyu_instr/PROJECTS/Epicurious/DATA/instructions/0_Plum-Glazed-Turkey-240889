1. Prepare the Giblet Broth one day ahead: Simmer the chicken broth, giblets and neck in a saucepan until the giblets are tender, about 1 hour. Strain the broth into a bowl; cover and refrigerate. Shred the meat from the neck and finely chop the giblets; cover and refrigerate.
2. Preheat oven to 325°F. Prepare the turkey: Squeeze the orange inside the body and neck cavities; sprinkle with paprika, salt and pepper. Stuff loosely with Cranberry Fennel Stuffing , using about 3 cups for the neck and 8 cups for the body. Close the turkey with lacers or sew with a large needle and heavy thread; tie legs together. Rub bird with the butter; sprinkle with paprika, salt and pepper.
3. Place a rack in a large roasting pan and cover with 2 long pieces of heavy-duty foil, lengthwise and crosswise. Place the turkey, breast-side up, on top of the foil. Pour 2 cups of the Giblet Broth into the pan. Close the foil loosely over the turkey. Roast for 1 1/2 hours.
4. Open up the foil and roast the turkey, basting with pan juices every 30 minutes, for 2 1/2 hours. If the turkey starts to get too brown, tent it loosely with the foil.
5. Raise the oven temperature to 350°F and cook the turkey for 1 more hour or until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh reads 170°F. The temperature in the breast should read 160°F, and the juices should run clear when the thigh is pricked with a sharp knife. During the last 15 minutes of roasting, brush the turkey with the Plum Glaze . Transfer the turkey to a platter. Let the turkey rest, loosely covered with foil, for 20 minutes before carving. Remove the stuffing to a serving dish and cover.
6. Present the turkey, garnished with the grapes and sage, before carving. Arrange the carved meat on a large, decorative platter and serve with hot Giblet Gravy.

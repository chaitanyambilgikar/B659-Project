Pulse eggs in a food processor until coarsely chopped and transfer to a large bowl, then chill, covered, until ready to use.
Cook onion and garlic in oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately low heat, stirring occasionally, until onion is golden, about 20 minutes.
While onion cooks, trim and rinse livers and pat dry. (Halve any large pieces.) Add livers to onion and increase heat to moderately high, then sauté, stirring occasionally, until livers are just cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes (they should not be pink in center). Transfer mixture (including oil) to a shallow plate and cool to room temperature, about 20 minutes.
Pulse liver mixture in food processor until coarsely puréed, then stir into eggs, along with salt and pepper, until combined. Chill, covered, at least 1 hour, then season with more salt just before serving.

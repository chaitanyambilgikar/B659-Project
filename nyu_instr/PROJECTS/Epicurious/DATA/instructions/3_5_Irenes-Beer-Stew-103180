Cook onions in 2 tablespoons oil in a 6- to 8-quart ovenproof heavy pot over moderate heat, stirring frequently, until lightly browned, about 30 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring, 5 minutes.
Preheat oven to 325°F.
Combine flour, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Pat beef dry and toss with flour mixture. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large heavy skillet until hot but not smoking, then brown beef in batches, adding as browned to onions and adding more oil to skillet as necessary.
Add soy, Worcestershire, and steak sauces, bay leaves, thyme, and enough beer to pot to just cover beef and onions, then bring to a simmer. Cover pot and braise stew in middle of oven, stirring in brown sugar after about an hour if desired, until meat is tender, about 2 hours.
Season stew with salt and pepper.

Make green grape, red grape, and black grape sorbets: Making 1 sorbet at a time, in a blender purée sorbet ingredients until sugar is dissolved, about 3 minutes, and pour through a fine sieve into a bowl, pressing on solids. Discard solids and freeze each sorbet in an ice-cream maker.
Transfer each sorbet as made to an airtight container and in freezer harden until firm. Sorbets may be made 1 week ahead and kept frozen, covered.
Using a soup spoon, scoop sorbets, alternating flavors, into 8 parfait glasses.

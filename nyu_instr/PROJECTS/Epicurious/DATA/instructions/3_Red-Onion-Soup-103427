Heat 3 tablespoons oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add onions and sauté until brown, about 25 minutes. Sprinkle flour over onions; stir 2 minutes. Gradually mix in broth, scraping up browned bits from pan bottom. Simmer 15 minutes. Working in batches and using on/off turns, blend soup in processor to coarse puree. Return soup to pot and bring just to simmer. Season with salt and pepper. Ladle soup into bowls.

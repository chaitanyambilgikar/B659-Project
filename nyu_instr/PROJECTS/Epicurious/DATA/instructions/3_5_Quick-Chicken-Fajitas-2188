Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and bell pepper and sauté until almost tender, about 10 minutes. Add cumin, paprika, cayenne, garlic powder, oregano and thyme and continue cooking 1 minute. Mix in broth and bring to boil. Add chicken and stir until cooked through, about 5 minutes. Spoon chicken mixture into tortillas. Top with tomato and avocado. Roll up. Serve, passing salsa separately.

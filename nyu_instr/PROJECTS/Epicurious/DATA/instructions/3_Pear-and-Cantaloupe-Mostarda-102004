Peel enough cantaloupe rind (leaving about 1/4" of the flesh) to yield 2 pounds. Cut into 3/4" squares, cover with cold salted water (1/4 cup salt to 1 quart water) and leave overnight. The next day drain the rind and place in a preserving kettle with the pears. Cover with fresh water and cook over medium heat 1/2 hour. Drain. Bring sugar, mustard and water to a boil in the preserving kettle. Add the drained fruit and the garlic cloves. (Impale the garlic cloves on toothpicks. They will be discarded later and are much easier to remove.) Cook over medium heat for 2 1/2 hours or until the cantaloupe rind is translucent and the juices syrupy. Discard the garlic, spoon the fruit and syrup into hot, sterilized preserving jars, cover and seal.

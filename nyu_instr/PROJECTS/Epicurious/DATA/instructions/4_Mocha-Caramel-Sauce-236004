Stir together cream and espresso powder.
Cook sugar in a dry 2-quart heavy saucepan over moderately high heat, undisturbed, until it begins to melt, about 2 minutes. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally with a fork, until sugar is melted into a deep golden caramel, 1 to 2 minutes.
Remove from heat and carefully pour in espresso cream (mixture will steam and bubble vigorously), then cook over low heat, stirring, until caramel is dissolved, 1 to 2 minutes. Add chocolate and salt and cook, stirring, until sauce is smooth. Serve warm or at room temperature.

Brush petals with an egg white that is slightly beaten with a couple of drops of water.
Hold the petal with a tweezer, and sprinkle with superfine sugar. Tap the tweezer to remove excess sugar.
Remove to a rack to dry completely. Store in an airtight container.
Sugared flowers can be made in advance and stored up to one month.

Set broiler rack about 4 inches from heat and preheat broiler.
Core apples and cut crosswise into 1/4-inch rings, discarding ends. Brush rings with butter on both sides and arrange in one layer in a shallow baking pan. Broil apple rings until edges just begin to turn golden, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle rings, evenly with cinnamon sugar and broil until glazed and golden, about 2 minutes more.
Serve apples with ice cream.

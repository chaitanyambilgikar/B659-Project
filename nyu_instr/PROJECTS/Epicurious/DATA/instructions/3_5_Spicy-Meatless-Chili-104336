Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and sauté until tender, about 5 minutes. Add chili powder; stir 1 minute. Stir in tomatoes with juices, veggie crumbles, beans and 1/4 cup water. Cook until slightly thickened, breaking up any large tomato pieces and stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Divide chili between 2 soup bowls; top with cheese and serve.

Make chicken: Soak chicken in milk to cover for 20 to 30 minutes. Spray a baking dish (one that will accommodate all the chicken pieces comfortably in one layer) with nonstick vegetable-oil spray.
Preheat oven to 400°F. Put the butter in the baking dish and heat it in the oven until the butter melts. Mix flour and seasonings together in paper sack or plastic baggie (1-gallon size). Shake each piece of chicken in seasoned flour. Place chicken pieces, skin-side down, in baking dish. Bake for 20 minutes. Turn chicken over and bake an additional 20 minutes or until cooked through and crispy. Remove chicken and set aside in a warm place.
Make gravy: Sauté the scallions and mushrooms in the drippings over medium high heat, until soft. Mix the seasoned flour with milk first until you see no lumps. Whisk milk mixture into the sautéing onions and mushrooms. Taste and add bouillon cube, if desired (You may want to use additional milk if you do). Boil until thickened to preferred consistency. Put into a gravy dish and serve alongside the baked chicken.

Boil wine, spices, salt, bay leaf, and garlic in a deep 10-inch heavy skillet 5 minutes. Add mushrooms and oil, then reduce heat and gently simmer, uncovered, until mushrooms are barely tender, about 15 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and cool mushrooms in liquid, uncovered. Chill, covered, at least 8 hours for flavors to meld. Discard bay leaf and whole spices. Serve at room temperature.

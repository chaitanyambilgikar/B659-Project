1. Make the dough: Combine the flour and salt in a large bowl. Break the egg into the dough and mix by hand until the dough is mealy. While working the egg into the dough, slowly add the olive oil, kneading until the mixture is coarse and mealy. Add the water in a slow, steady stream, kneading vigorously, until you have a smooth but firm dough. Cover and let rest for 20 minutes.
2. While the dough is resting, prepare the filling: Combine the cheese, eggs, and pepper in a medium bowl and mix well. Lightly oil several baking sheets. Preheat the oven to 400°F.
3. Divide the dough into 6 balls. Flatten each ball and pass it through a pasta maker several times, starting at the widest gauge and working up to about the third one, until the pastry is about as thick as a quarter. Place the strip in front of you and cut into 2 1/2-inch squares.
4. Place a heaping teaspoon of filling in the center of each square. Fold the points of the square inward so that they all meet in the center, over the filling. Brush lightly with the beaten egg yolk. Place on the baking sheets and bake until golden and puffed, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the oven, cool slightly on racks, and serve either warm or at room temperature. To store, keep covered in the refrigerator.

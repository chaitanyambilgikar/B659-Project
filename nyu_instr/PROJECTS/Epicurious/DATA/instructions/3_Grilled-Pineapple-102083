Prepare grill. Cut pineapple lengthwise through leaves, keeping leaves attached, into 8 wedges. Grill pineapple wedges, a cut side down, on a lightly oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals until just charred, about 2 minutes on each cut side.
Serve pineapple with ice cream and dulce de leche.

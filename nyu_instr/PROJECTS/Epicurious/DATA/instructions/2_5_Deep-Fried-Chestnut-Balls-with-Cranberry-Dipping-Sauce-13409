In a heavy saucepan cook the onion and the garlic in the butter over moderately low heat, stirring, until the onion is softened, add the chestnuts, the broth, the cayenne, the cloves, and salt and pepper to taste, and simmer the mixture, covered, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes. or until the chestnuts are very tender. In a food processor purée the mixture until it is smooth, add the parsley and 1 cup of the bread crumbs, and process the mixture until is it combined well. Transfer the mixture to a bowl, let it cool, and chill it, covered, for at least 6 hours or overnight. Have ready in one bowl the egg wash and in another bowl the remaining 1/2 cup bread crumbs combined with the almonds. Form the chestnut mixture by heaping teaspoons into balls, dip the balls, in the egg wash, and roll them in the almond mixture. In a deep fryer heat 2 inches of the oil until it registers 375°F. on a deep-fat thermometer, in it fry the balls in batches for 2 minutes, or until they are golden brown, and transfer them as they are fried to paper towels to drain.
In a blender or food processor purée the cranberry sauce and serve it with the chestnut balls.

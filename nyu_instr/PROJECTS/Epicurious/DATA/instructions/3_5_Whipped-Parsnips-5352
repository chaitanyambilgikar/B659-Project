Combine parsnips, 3/4 cup milk and whipping cream in heavy large saucepan. Cover and simmer over medium-low heat until parsnips are tender and most of liquid has evaporated, about 30 minutes. Transfer mixture to blender. Puree until smooth, thinning with more milk if necessary. Transfer to bowl. Season parsnips to taste with salt and pepper and serve.

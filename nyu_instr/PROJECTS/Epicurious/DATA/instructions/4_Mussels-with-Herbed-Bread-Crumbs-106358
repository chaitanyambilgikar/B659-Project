Preheat oven to 450°F.
Stir together bread crumbs, oil, cheese, garlic, oregano, red pepper flakes, and table salt.
Scrub reserved shells inside and out and dry thoroughly. Spread kosher salt about 1/4 inch deep in a large shallow (1-inch-deep) baking pan and nestle shells in salt to keep them level. Return shucked mussels to shells and top each with about 1 teaspoon bread crumb mixture.
Bake mussels in middle of oven until crumbs are golden brown and crisp, about 7 minutes.
Cool slightly and brush salt from bottoms of mussel shells before serving.

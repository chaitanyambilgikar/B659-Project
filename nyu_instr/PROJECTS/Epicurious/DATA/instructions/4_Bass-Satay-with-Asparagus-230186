Combine marinade ingredients. Reserve 2 tbsp and marinate bass in the rest (covered, in the refrigerator) for 24 hours. Spear each piece of fish on a wooden skewer. Place on foil-lined pan and broil until sauce caramelizes, 3 or 4 minutes. Toss asparagus with oil, salt, and pepper. Heat a sauté pan (no oil) over high heat, 7 minutes. Add asparagus; sauté all sides. Arrange asparagus on a plate. Top with bass, drizzle with reserved marinade, garnish with chives. (To evaporate alcohol, increase sake and mirin to 1 1/4 cups each. Simmer until mixture is reduced by half and is syrupy.)

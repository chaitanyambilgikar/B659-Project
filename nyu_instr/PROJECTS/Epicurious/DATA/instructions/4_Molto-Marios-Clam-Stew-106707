1. Preheat the oven to 450°F. In a heavy-bottomed 6-quart saucepan, heat the olive oil; add the onion, mushrooms, and chorizo. Stirring occasionally, cook over medium heat until the onion is softened, about 8 minutes.
2. Add the vermouth and bring to a boil. Add the tomato sauce, wine, and clams. Cover and cook until the clams open, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat.
3. Uncover the clams and discard any that did not open. Serve immediately in shallow bowls with warm garlic bread.

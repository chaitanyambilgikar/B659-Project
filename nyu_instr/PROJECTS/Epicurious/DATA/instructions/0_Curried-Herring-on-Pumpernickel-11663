Cut away and discard dark flesh on herring. Chop herring into 1/4-inch pieces and pat dry between paper towels. In a bowl stir herring together with mayonnaise, curry powder, onion, scallion, and salt to taste. Curried herring may be made 1 day in advanced and kept covered and chilled.
Spread butter on bread and cut each slice into 4 triangles. Divide herring among triangles and garnish with shoots.

Spread 1 cup pasta sauce over bottom of heavy medium skillet. Mix turkey, breadcrumbs, pesto, egg white and salt in medium bowl. Using moistened hands, form mixture into 8 meatballs. Place meatballs in single layer in sauce. Spoon remaining sauce over. Bring to simmer. Cover; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until meatballs are cooked through, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite. Drain pasta; divide between bowls. Top with meatballs and sauce.

Preheat oven to 425°F. Finely chop garlic cloves with cayenne pepper and saffron in mini processor. Add roasted red pepper and vinegar to processor; blend until almost smooth. Blend in mayonnaise. Season rouille to taste with salt and pepper.
Transfer 1/3 cup rouille to medium bowl. Add shrimp and toss to coat. Arrange sourdough baguette slices on baking sheet. Spread each slice with rouille. Bake until bottoms of toasts are crisp and rouille is darker in color, about 10 minutes.
Heat large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add shrimp, spreading in single layer. Cook until just browned and opaque in center, about 2 minutes per side. Arrange toasts on plate. Place 2 shrimp on each toast; sprinkle toasts with capers.

Cook spinach according to package instructions and drain well. Squeeze spinach dry by handfuls and chop fine. In a bowl stir together spinach, ricotta, 1 cup Parmesan, eggs, prosciutto, parsley, and salt and pepper to taste.
Preheat oven to 350°F. and oil a 13-by 9-inch baking dish.
In a large bowl of cold water soak lasagne squares until softened, about 15 minutes. Drain squares and pat dry between paper towels.
Spread 1 cup of tomato sauce on bottom of prepared dish. Working with 1 square at a time, spread about 1/3 cup filling along one edge and roll up to enclose filling, leaving ends open.
Arrange cannelloni as formed, seam sides down, in one layer in dish. Spoon 2 cups sauce evenly over cannelloni, covering them, sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup Parmesan.
Bake cannelloni in middle of oven 30 minutes and let stand 10 minutes before serving.
Serve cannelloni with remaining tomato sauce, heated.

Preheat oven to 350°F.
Stir together honey, pepper, salt, and allspice and add pecans, tossing to coat well. Spread pecans in 1 layer in a shallow (1-inch-deep) baking pan and sprinkle with sugar. Bake in middle of oven 15 minutes, then stir pecans and bake 5 minutes more. Transfer to a sheet of wax or parchment paper to cool and, working quickly, separate pecans with a fork while still warm. Serve at room temperature.

Preheat oven to 375°F. Whisk flour, 2 teaspoons salt, and black pepper in a medium bowl. Beat eggs, Dijon mustard, and cayenne in another medium bowl. Mix the bread-crumbs and remaining 1 teaspoon salt in a third medium bowl.
Dredge 1 chicken breast in flour mixture, shaking off excess. Coat with egg mixture, then dredge in breadcrumbs. Transfer to a wire rack. Repeat with remaining chicken.
Heat oil in a large ovenproof skillet over medium heat. Add chicken; cook until golden, 2-3 minutes. Flip chicken; transfer to oven. Bake until cooked through, about 12 minutes.

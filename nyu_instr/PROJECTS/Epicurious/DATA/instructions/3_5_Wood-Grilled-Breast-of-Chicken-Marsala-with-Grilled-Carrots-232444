Bring marsala to a low boil in a small pan over medium heat. Add mushrooms, shallots, and garlic. Season with salt and pepper. Simmer until sauce reduces, about 20 minutes. Discard garlic and set sauce aside. Coat grill with cooking spray and grill chicken 4 to 6 minutes on each side or until cooked through. Grill carrots about 5 minutes, rotating until charred.

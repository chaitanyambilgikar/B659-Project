Whisk cornmeal and water in medium bowl to blend. Bring milk and salt to simmer in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat. Gradually add cornmeal mixture, whisking constantly until polenta comes to boil. Reduce heat and simmer until polenta is very thick, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. Mix in maple syrup and butter. Season to taste with pepper and transfer to bowl.

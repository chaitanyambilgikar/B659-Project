Preheat oven to 200°F.
Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a 12-inch heavy skillet (preferably oval) over low heat and remove from heat.
Rinse trout and pat dry. Brush with melted butter inside and out and season with 3/4 teaspoon salt (total for both fish). Mound flour on a sheet of wax paper, then dredge each fish in flour to coat completely, shaking off excess.
Add oil and 2 tablespoons butter to skillet and heat over moderately high heat until foam subsides, then sauté both trout, gently turning over once using 2 spatulas, until golden brown and almost cooked through, about 8 minutes total (fish will continue to cook as it stands). Transfer each trout to a plate and keep warm in oven.
Pour off fat from skillet and wipe skillet clean. Melt remaining 1/2 stick butter over moderately low heat, then cook pecans, stirring, until fragrant and a shade darker, 1 to 2 minutes. Add parsley, pepper, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, swirling skillet to combine, and remove from heat. Add lemon juice, swirling skillet to incorporate, and spoon over trout. Serve immediately.

Preheat oven to 400°F. Toss beets with 1/4 cup olive oil in medium bowl to coat. Cut heavy-duty aluminum foil into two 15-inch squares. Place 1 square on baking sheet. Transfer beets to center of square, leaving 1-inch border around edges. Sprinkle beets with sea salt and pepper. Scatter clementine segments atop beets. Place second sheet of foil over beet mixture; crimp edges to seal tightly. Roast until beets are tender, about 1 hour.
Carefully open foil packet (steam will be released). Transfer beet mixture to large bowl. Stir in fresh mint and clementine peel. Drizzle with remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and season with salt and pepper.

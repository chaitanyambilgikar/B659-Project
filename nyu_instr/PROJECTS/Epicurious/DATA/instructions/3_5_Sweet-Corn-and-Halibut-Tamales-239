Preheat oven to 375°F. Lightly oil baking sheet. Carefully remove husks from corn, reserving 4 largest ones. Lay corn ears on work surface and cut off kernels. Process corn kernels in food processor until coarsely chopped (do not puree). Add cilantro, cornmeal, sugar and salt and process just to combine. Season with pepper. Using slotted spoon, transfer corn mixture to small bowl. Mix in finely chopped red bell pepper.
Arrange 2 corn husks on prepared baking sheet. Spread 1/4 of corn mixture (roughly matching size of halibut fillets) over each husk on sheet. Season halibut on both sides with salt and pepper. Place over corn mixture. Top each with another 1/4 of corn mixture. Press remaining husks over to cover tightly. Cover both tamales with foil.
Bake until halibut is just cooked through, approximately 20 minutes.

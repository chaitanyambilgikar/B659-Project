Mash the garlic in a large wooden salad bowl, rubbing it well around the sides. Let it stand thus for a few minutes, then scrape out and discard the garlic pulp. Put the anchovy fillets and cheese into the bowl and mash them to a smooth paste. Coddle the egg by cooking it in fast-boiling water for one minute, just enough to cut the edge of rawness. Add this to the anchovy-cheese mixture and work smooth. Blend in the oil and vinegar. Neither salt nor pepper is needed.
Make croutons by buttering the bread on both sides, cubing it small, and browning the croutons in the oven until crisp.
Wash the romaine well, dry and crisp it. Break it into the bowl, sprinkle on the croutons and toss lightly in the dressing until every leaf is coated and the dressing absorbed by the croutons.
For a memorable outdoor meal on a warm summer evening, serve an outsize bowl of Caesar salad with grilled steak sandwiches followed by peach shortcake.

Preheat oven to 400°F and lightly coat nine 1/4-cup muffin tins with cooking spray.
In a large bowl combine cereals, milk, and orange juice and let stand 5 minutes. In a small bowl whisk together flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt. Into cereal mixture stir egg white and honey until combined well. Add flour mixture and stir until just combined. Divide batter among muffin tins and bake in middle of oven 20 minutes, or until golden and a tester comes out clean. Turn muffins out onto racks and cool.

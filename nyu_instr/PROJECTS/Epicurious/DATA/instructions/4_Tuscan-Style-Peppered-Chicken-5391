Rub each chicken half all over with 2 tablespoons oil, then 1 1/2 teaspoons pepper. Sprinkle generously with salt. Let stand at room temperature 1 hour.
Preheat broiler. Arrange chicken, skin side down, on broiler pan. Watching closely to avoid burning, broil chicken 5 to 6 inches from heat source until golden brown, about 12 minutes. Remove broiler pan from oven. Using tongs, transfer chicken to plate. Pour off any pan drippings. Return chicken, skin side up, to broiler pan. Broil until skin is crisp and golden brown, about 5 minutes. Turn chicken over, skin side down again, and broil until cooked through, about 8 minutes longer. Transfer chicken to platter; let stand 5 minutes. Serve with lemon wedges to squeeze over

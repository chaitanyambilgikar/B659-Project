Holding 1 edge of dough in the air with both hands and letting bottom touch work surface, move hands around edge (like turning a steering wheel), allowing weight of dough to stretch it roughly into a 10-inch round. Flour backs of your fists and with them stretch dough from center of underside, turning dough to maintain a rough circle, until 13 to 14 inches.
Place on baking sheet.
Spread bean purée over dough, leaving a 1-inch border around edge. Top purée with tomatoes and onion, then sprinkle with rosemary and dot with cheese. Season with salt and pepper.
Bake pizza on bottom oven rack until crust is browned and crisp and topping is bubbling, 12 to 15 minutes.

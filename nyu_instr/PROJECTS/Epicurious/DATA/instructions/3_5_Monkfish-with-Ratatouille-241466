Heat oven to 450°F. Toss eggplant, zucchini, bell pepper and onion with 2 teaspoon oil in a bowl. Add thyme; season with salt and pepper and toss again. Coat a shallow baking pan with cooking spray. Arrange vegetables on pan and roast until tender, about 20 minutes. Stir in garlic and marinara. Cover loosely with foil and roast 10 minutes more. Remove pan from oven. Stir in chopped basil. Rub fillets with remaining 2 teaspoon oil; season with salt and pepper. Nestle fish in vegetables; cover loosely with foil. Bake until fish is just cooked through, about 10 minutes. Top with basil leaves and capers.

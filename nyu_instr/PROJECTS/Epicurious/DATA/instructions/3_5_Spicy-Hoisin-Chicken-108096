Preheat oven to 500°F.
Whisk together all ingredients except chicken, then coat chicken all over with sauce. Arrange thighs, skin sides up in 1 layer without crowding, in a foil-lined large shallow baking pan (1 inch deep). Roast in upper third of oven until chicken is cooked through and glaze is brown, 20 to 30 minutes.

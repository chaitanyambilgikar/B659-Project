Cut a 12" round of parchment paper; snip a hole about the size of a quarter in the center of round. Combine turnips, carrots, 8 tablespoons butter, brown sugar, and ginger in a 12" skillet. Season with salt and pepper. Rest parchment round on top of vegetables (do not cover with lid).
Simmer over medium-high heat until vegetables are crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Discard parchment; add remaining 4 tablespoons butter and chestnuts. Simmer, swirling pan often, until a glaze forms, 8-10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a large bowl. Garnish with herbs.

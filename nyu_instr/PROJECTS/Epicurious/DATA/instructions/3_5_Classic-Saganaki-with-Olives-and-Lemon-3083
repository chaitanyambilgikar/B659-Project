Rinse cheese slices under cold water (do not pat dry). Coat with flour. Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat until almost smoking. Add cheese and cook until beginning to brown, about 1 minutes per side. Transfer to plates.
Squeeze lemon over cheese; sprinkle with oregano and pepper. Serve with tomatoes, pita and olives.

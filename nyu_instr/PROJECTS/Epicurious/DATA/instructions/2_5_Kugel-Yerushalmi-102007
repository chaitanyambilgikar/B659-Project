Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the noodles and cook until tender, 5 to 8 minutes. Drain and set aside.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Grease a 13-by-9-inch baking dish or a large tube pan.
Heat the oil in a large saucepan over low heat. Add the sugar and stir until dissolved. Stop stirring and cook until dark brown but not burned, about 10 minutes.
Immediately add the noodles, stirring to coat evenly. Remove from the heat and season with salt and pepper. Let cool until lukewarm, at least 15 minutes, then add the eggs. Adjust the seasonings.
Spoon the noodle mixture into the prepared baking dish. Bake until golden brown and crispy — about 1 hour for the baking dish, about 1 1/2 hours for the tube pan. Serve warm or at room temperature with roast chicken, meat, or cholent.

For cake: Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter and flour three 9-inch round cake pans. Sift flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt into medium bowl. Mix cold water, corn oil and vanilla extract in large bowl. Whisk in dry ingredients. Divide batter among prepared pans, spreading with spatula (batter will be about 1/4 inch high). Bake cakes until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 10 minutes (cakes will be scant 1/4 inch high). Cool cakes in pans on racks 10 minutes. Cut around pan sides to loosen cakes. Turn cakes out onto racks; cool completely.
For icing: Bring whipping cream to simmer in heavy large saucepan. Reduce heat to low. Add 1 pound chopped chocolate and whisk until melted and smooth. Cool icing until thick enough to spread, about 30 minutes.
Place 1 cake layer on rack set over baking sheet. Spread 3/4 cup icing over cake. Sprinkle with 1/2 cup chopped cashews. Top with second cake layer. Spread 3/4 cup icing over. Sprinkle with 1/2 cup cashews. Top with third cake layer. Chill cake until icing sets, about 1 hour.
Stir remaining icing in saucepan over low heat just until pourable. Pour icing over cake, allowing icing to run down sides. Smooth cake sides with rubber spatula. Press remaining 3/4 cup chopped cashews onto sides of cake. Refrigerate until icing sets, about 1 hour. (Cake can be prepared 2 days ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Let cake stand 2 hours at room temperature before serving.)

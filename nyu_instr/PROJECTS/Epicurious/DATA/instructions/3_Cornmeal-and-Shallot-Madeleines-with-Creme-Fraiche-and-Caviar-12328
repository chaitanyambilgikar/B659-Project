In a skillet cook the shallot in 1 tablespoon of the butter over moderately low heat, stirring, until it is softened and let the mixture cool completely. In a bowl stir together the cornmeal, the flour, the baking powder, and the shallot mixture, add the remaining 1 tablespoon butter, cut into bits, and blend the mixture until it resembles fine meal. Stir in the egg, 1/4 cup of the crème fraîche, the water, and salt and pepper to taste and stir the batter until it is combined well.
On a baking sheet heat 16 well-buttered 2 2/3- by 1 3/4-inch madeleine tins (about 2 tablespoons capacity) in the middle of a preheated 400°F. oven for 2 minutes, remove the tins from the oven, and into each tin spoon a heaping 1 1/2 teaspoons of the batter. Bake the madeleines on the baking sheet in the middle of the 400°F. oven for 6 to 8 minutes, or until a tester inserted in the centers comes out clean, turn them out onto racks, and let them cool completely. The madeleines may be made 3 days in advance and kept chilled in an airtight container. Top the madeleines with the additional crème fraîche and the caviar.

Put the cream, sugar, and ginger in a pan and bring to the boil, then remove from the heat and leave to infuse overnight.
The next day, whisk the egg yolks together in a bowl. Bring the cream mixture back to the boil and whisk it into the yolks. Strain through a fine sieve, then divide between 4 ramekins or other small dishes. Place on a baking sheet and bake in an oven preheated to 160°C/325°F/Gas Mark 3 for about 35 minutes, until set.
Shortly before serving, sprinkle the Demerara sugar over the crème brûlées and then caramelize with a blowtorch. Leave for a few minutes until the sugar hardens, then garnish with the raspberries and mint sprigs.

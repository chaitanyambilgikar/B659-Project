Prepare barbecue (high heat). Brush grill rack with oil. Brush pattypan squash, zucchini, and tomatoes with olive oil; sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. Grill until vegetables are blistered and slightly charred, about 8 minutes for squash and zucchini, turning occasionally, and about 6 minutes for tomatoes, shifting occasionally. Transfer to platter.

In a steamer set over boiling water steam the cauliflower, covered, for 5 minutes, or until it is just tender. While the cauliflower is steaming, in a skillet cook the bacon over moderate heat, stirring, until it is crisp and transfer it with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon of the fat, to the skillet add the cauliflower, the dill, the lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste, and heat the mixture over moderately low heat, stirring, until the cauliflower is coated well with the dill mixture. Sprinkle the cauliflower mixture with the bacon bits.

1. Preheat the oven to 300°F. Lightly grease a 9x4-inch loaf pan, line with plastic wrap, and grease the plastic wrap. Set aside.
2. Put the walnuts on a rimmed baking sheet and toast in the oven until golden brown and fragrant, about 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool completely.
3. Bring 4 cups of water to boil in a medium saucepan. Add the dates and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt and cook for 10 minutes. Drain and spread the dates in a single layer on a cooling rack to dry.
4. Microwave the maltose on high heat until softened, about 40 seconds. Put the maltose, walnuts, dates, cinnamon, oil and the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt in a medium saucepan and set over medium heat. Cook, stirring vigorously, until the mixture is thick, about 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and cool slightly in the pan, then transfer to the cake pan. Spread in an even layer and let cool completely and harden at room temperature.
5. To unmold, invert the candy onto a cutting board and peel off the plastic wrap. Cut into 1-inch cubes with a greased knife. The candies can be individually wrapped in plastic wrap and stored at room temperature for up to 1 week.

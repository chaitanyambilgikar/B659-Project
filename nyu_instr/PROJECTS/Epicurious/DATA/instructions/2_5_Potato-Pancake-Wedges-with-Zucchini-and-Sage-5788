Position rack in top third of oven and preheat to 450°F. Coarsely grate onions, zucchini and then potatoes with hand grater or with medium shredding blade of food processor. Divide grated vegetable mixture between 2 kitchen towels; wrap tightly and squeeze out as much liquid as possible. Place vegetables in large bowl. Add sage and salt and toss to blend well.
Heat half of oil with half of margarine in each of 2 large nonstick oven-proof skillets over medium-high heat. Add half of vegetable mixture to each skillet. Using spatula, press mixtures firmly to even thickness. Cook 4 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and cook until bottom is golden brown, sliding spatula under pancakes occasionally to prevent sticking, about 6 minutes longer.
Place skillets in oven. Bake pancakes until top is firm, about 14 minutes. Remove from oven. If desired, preheat broiler and broil pancakes until top is golden, about 2 minutes. Loosen cakes with spatula. Turn each out onto baking sheet. (Can be prepared 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature. Rewarm in 400°F. oven until crisp, about 10 minutes.) Cut pancakes into wedges and serve.

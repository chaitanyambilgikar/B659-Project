Using hand grater, coarsely grate potato into large bowl. Add parsley and toss to blend. Divide mixture into 6 equal portions (about 1/3 cup each). Form each portion into 3/4-inch-thick round.
Pour vegetable oil into heavy large skillet to depth of 1/8 inch; heat over medium-high heat. Using spatula, carefully transfer 3 potato rounds to skillet. Flatten each into 3 1/2-inch round. Season with salt and pepper. Cook until pancakes are golden brown, crisp and cooked through, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Repeat with remaining 3 potato pancakes. Serve pancakes with sour cream.

Melt butter with oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add garlic and sauté until beginning to brown, about 2 minutes. Using slotted spoon, remove garlic and discard. Add mushrooms and sauté until brown and juices evaporate, about 15 minutes. Add wine and simmer until reduced to glaze on mushrooms, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. Season mushrooms to taste with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with parsley and serve.

Preheat oven to 300°F. Rinse ribs under cold water. Pat dry. Arrange ribs bone side up on 2 heavy large baking sheets with rims. Brush 1/4 cup sauce on each 6-rib piece. Sprinkle each with 1 teaspoon rub. Turn ribs over. Brush each piece with 1/4 cup sauce. Sprinkle each piece with 1 teaspoon rub.
Bake ribs meat side up 1 1/2 hours. Add 1/2 cup water to each pan. Continue baking until ribs are deep brown, every 30 minutes adding 1/2 cup water and basting, about 1 1/2 hours more.
Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat) or preheat broiler. Grill ribs until lightly charred, about 2 minutes per side.

Place 3/4 cup warm water and honey in processor. Sprinkle yeast over; let stand until mixture is foamy, about 5 minutes. Add flour, oil and salt. Process until dough forms. Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface. Knead until smooth, about 5 minutes. Transfer dough to large oiled bowl; turn to coat. Cover with plastic wrap, then kitchen towel. Let dough rise in warm draft-free area until doubled in volume, about 1 1/2 hours. Punch down dough. Divide into 2 equal balls.

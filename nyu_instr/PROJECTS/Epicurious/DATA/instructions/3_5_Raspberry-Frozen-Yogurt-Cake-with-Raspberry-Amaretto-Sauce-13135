Preheat oven to 350°F. Line bottom of a buttered 9- by 2-inch springform pan with a round of wax paper or parchment and butter paper. Dust pan with flour, knocking out excess.
To make cake layer: In a bowl whisk together whole eggs and yolk. Into another bowl sift together flour, baking powder, and salt. In a glass measuring cup stir together milk and Amaretto. In a bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed beat butter 1 minute and beat in sugar in a steady stream, scraping bowl occasionally, until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Beat in egg, a little at a time, beating well after each addition, until pale and fluffy. Stir in flour mixture in 3 batches alternately with milk mixture, beginning and ending with flour mixture and stirring until smooth after each addition.
Turn batter into pan, smoothing top, and bake in middle of oven until a tester comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Cool cake layer in pan on a rack 10 minutes. Run a thin knife around edge of pan and remove side of pan. Invert cake layer onto rack. Remove paper carefully and cool cake completely. With a long serrated knife halve cake horizontally. Clean springform pan and line with 2 sheets plastic wrap, leaving at least a 1-inch overhang. Put bottom half of cake, cut side up, in pan.
Make raspberry frozen yogurt: In a food processor purée raspberries with sugar and water and force through a fine sieve into a large bowl. Add frozen yogurt and stir until purée is well incorporated.
Working quickly, spoon about half of frozen yogurt over cake in pan, spreading evenly. Top with other half of cake layer, cut side down, and spoon remaining frozen yogurt on top, spreading evenly.
Arrange raspberries decoratively on top of cake, pushing slightly into frozen yogurt, and sprinkle almonds over top of cake. Freeze cake, covered, at least until frozen hard, about 6 hours, and up to 1 week.
Let cake soften in refrigerator at least 30 minutes and up to 45 minutes before serving. Remove cake from pan, discarding plastic wrap. Serve cake with sauce.
To make the sauce: In a food processor purée raspberries with sugar and Amaretto and force through a fine sieve into a bowl. Sauce may be made 3 days ahead and chilled, covered. Makes about 1 1/2 cups.

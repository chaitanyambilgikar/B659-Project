For curry sauce: Combine all ingredients in heavy medium saucepan. Bring to boil over medium-high heat, whisking to blend. Reduce heat to medium and simmer 1 minute. Remove from heat. Cover and let sauce stand at room temperature 10 minutes for flavors to blend. Strain. Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Rewarm before serving.)
For kaffir lime batter: Using on/off turns, mix flour and next 5 ingredients in processor until blended. Transfer flour mixture to medium metal bowl. Gradually whisk in 3/4 cup ginger ale. (Can be made 6 hours ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Add more ginger ale by tablespoonfuls if batter thickens.)
For shrimp: Add enough oil to heavy large saucepan to measure 1 1/2 inches deep. Attach deep-fry thermometer to side of pan (do not allow tip to touch bottom of pan). Heat oil to 370°F to 380°F. Place cornstarch in shallow bowl. Place coconut in medium bowl. Lightly dredge shrimp in cornstarch, shaking off excess. Working in batches, dip shrimp in batter to coat lightly, allowing excess batter to drip off. Dredge shrimp in coconut. Fry shrimp until cooked through and coconut is golden, about 2 minutes. Transfer to paper towels to drain.
Divide warm sauce among 6 plates. Stand 3 shrimp back-to-back on each plate. Garnish with cilantro sprigs and lime leaves and serve.

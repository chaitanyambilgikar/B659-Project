Blanch squash and onion in a medium pot of well-salted boiling water 2 minutes. Immediately transfer with a slotted spoon to an ice bath to stop cooking. Let stand until cool, then drain and transfer vegetables to a large glass or ceramic bowl.
Bring remaining ingredients with 4 teaspoon salt to a boil in a nonreactive medium saucepan, then pour over vegetables. Put a plate with a 3-pound weight (such as 2 large cans) on top to keep vegetables submerged.
Cool, then chill (with weight) at least 3 days for flavors to develop.

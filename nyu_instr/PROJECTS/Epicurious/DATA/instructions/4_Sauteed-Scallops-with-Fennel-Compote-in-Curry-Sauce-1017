Make compote: Melt butter in large skillet over medium heat. Add fennel; sauté until tender, about 12 minutes. Add stock, sugar and lemon. Simmer until fennel is very tender and mixture is thick, stirring often, about 20 minutes. (Can be made 1 day ahead; chill.)
Make sauce: Boil first 6 ingredients in medium saucepan until liquid is reduced to 3/4 cup, about 20 minutes. Add cream; boil until liquid is reduced to 3/4 cup, about 5 minutes. Strain sauce into small saucepan. Bring to simmer. Remove from heat. Gradually add 5 tablespoons butter, whisking just until melted. Season with salt and pepper.
Melt remaining 2 tablespoon butter in heavy large skillet over high heat. Season scallops with salt and pepper. Add to skillet and sauté until cooked through, about 3 minutes per side.
Rewarm fennel. Divide among 6 plates. Surround with scallops. Spoon sauce around scallops.

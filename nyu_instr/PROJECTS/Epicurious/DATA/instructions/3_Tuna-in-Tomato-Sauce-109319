Cook garlic in oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat, stirring, until golden, about 1 minute. Add spices and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in tomatoes (including juice), salt, and sugar and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until broken down, 20 to 25 minutes.
Season tuna with salt and pepper and arrange in 1 layer on top of sauce. Cook, covered, 2 minutes, then remove from heat and let stand, covered, until top of fish is no longer red, 1 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a platter and spoon sauce on top.

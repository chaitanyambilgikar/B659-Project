1. Preheat oven to 300 degrees.
2. Heat a large sauté pan on high, and add olive oil. Add almonds to pan, toast for 1 minute stirring often, and reduce heat to low. Continue to stir until the almonds are light golden brown, 6-7 minutes. Add honey and spices, salt and sesame seeds and stir to coat evenly.
3. Spread nuts out evenly on to a large sheet tray and place in the oven until honey is dry, 10-15 minutes. Allow nuts to cool before serving.

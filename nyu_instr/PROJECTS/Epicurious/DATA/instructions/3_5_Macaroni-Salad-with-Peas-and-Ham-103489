Cook macaroni in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally. Drain; rinse with cold water and drain well. Place macaroni in large bowl. Add ham, bell pepper, peas, celery, shallots and parsley. Whisk vinegar, lemon juice and mustard in small bowl to blend; whisk in oil. Season dressing with salt and pepper. Toss salad with dressing. Cover; chill at least 2 and up to 6 hours, tossing occasionally. Serve salad cold or at room temperature.

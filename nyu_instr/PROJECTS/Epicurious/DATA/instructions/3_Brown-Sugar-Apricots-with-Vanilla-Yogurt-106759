Prepare grill for cooking. If using a charcoal grill, open vents on bottom of grill and on lid.
Arrange apricots, cut sides up, in disposable roasting pan and sprinkle with brown sugar, patting and pressing with fingers to help evenly adhere.
When fire is low (you can hold your hand 5 inches above rack for 4 to 5 seconds), cook apricots in pan, covered with grill lid, without turning, until sugar is melted and apricots are softened, about 5 minutes.
Serve apricots with yogurt on the side.

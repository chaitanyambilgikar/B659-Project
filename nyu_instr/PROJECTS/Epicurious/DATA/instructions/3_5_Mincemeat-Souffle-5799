Using electric mixer, beat yolks and 1/3 cup sugar in medium bowl until thick, about 3 minutes. Beat in flour. Bring milk to simmer in heavy medium saucepan. Gradually whisk hot milk into yolk mixture. Return mixture to saucepan. Whisk constantly over medium heat until custard thickens and boils, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Whisk in mincemeat, peel and vanilla. Cool to lukewarm.
Preheat oven to 400°F. Butter 6- to 7-cup soufflé dish. Using clean dry beaters, beat egg whites in large bowl until soft peaks form. Gradually add remaining 1/4 cup sugar; beat until glossy medium-firm peaks form. Fold 1/3 of egg whites into mincemeat mixture. Fold in remaining whites in 2 more additions. Gently transfer soufflé mixture to prepared dish. Bake until soufflé is puffed and deep golden, about 35 minutes. Serve immediately.

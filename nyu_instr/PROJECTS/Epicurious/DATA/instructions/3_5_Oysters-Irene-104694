1. Place oven rack 5 inches away from the heat and set oven to broil. Place oysters on a baking sheet. Divide bacon equally among the oysters. Transfer to the oven and broil until bacon is light brown and crispy, about 3 minutes.
2. Remove oysters from oven and top with red pepper and Parmigiano Reggiano. Return oysters to oven and continue broiling until cheese has browned, about 2 minutes.
3. Remove from the oven and transfer oysters to a platter. Sprinkle platter with chopped parsley and lemon juice. Serve immediately.
To roast peppers: Using a long-handled fork char the peppers over an open flame, turning them, for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the skins are blackened. (Or broil the peppers on a rack of a broiler pan under a preheated broiler about 2 inches from the heat, turning them every 5 minutes, for 15 to 25 minutes, or until the skins are blistered and charred.) Transfer the peppers to a bowl and let them steam, covered, until they are cool enough to handle. Keeping the peppers whole, peel them starting at the blossom end, cut off the tops, and discard the seeds and ribs.

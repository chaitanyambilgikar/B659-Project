For beans: Place beans in large bowl; cover generously with water. Let stand at room temperature overnight.
Drain beans; transfer to heavy large pot. Add 3 quarts water, oil, garlic, sage bunch, and peppercorns. Bring to boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer uncovered until beans are tender, about 1 hour 5 minutes. Remove from heat; mix in salt. Cool beans 1 hour. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Refrigerate in water.)
For sauce: Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add sage and garlic; sauté 2 minutes. Add tomatoes and sauté until tomatoes soften and begin to release juices, about 8 minutes.
Drain beans, reserving cooking liquid. Discard sage bunch. Mix beans into tomato sauce. Simmer over medium-low heat until sauce thickens slightly and flavors blend, adding reserved cooking liquid by half cupfuls if mixture is dry, about 30 minutes (beans should have slightly soupy consistency). Season with salt and pepper. Serve beans warm or at room temperature.

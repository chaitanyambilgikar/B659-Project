Place flour and breadcrumbs on separate plates. Coat cheese rounds with flour. Dip cheese into egg, then into breadcrumbs, coating completely. Place on small baking sheet. Spoon hazelnuts atop cheese. Gently press hazelnuts into cheese to adhere. Cover and refrigerate at least 30 minutes or overnight.
Whisk vinegar, orange peel and orange juice concentrate in medium bowl to blend. Gradually whisk in oil. Season with salt and pepper. (Vinaigrette can be made 4 hours ahead. Store at room temperature; rewhisk before using.)
Preheat oven to 400°F. Bake cheese until heated through and coating browns, about 6 minutes. Toss watercress and endive in large bowl with enough vinaigrette to coat. Season greens with salt and pepper. Divide greens among 4 plates. Top with warm cheese.

In a heavy saucepan cook the onion in the oil over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until it is golden, add the chili powder, and cook the mixture, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the broth, bring the liquid to a boil, and stir in the couscous. Cover the pan, remove it from the heat, and let the couscous stand for 5 minutes. Fluff the couscous with a fork and stir in the scallion greens.

Whisk together mayonnaise, ketchup, relish, vinegar, and 1/8 teaspoon each of salt and pepper. Spread on bread and make sandwiches with turkey, sauerkraut, and cheese.
Melt butter in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat, then cook sandwiches, turning once, until bread is golden and cheese is melted, about 6 minutes total.

Preheat oven to 375°F. Spray large rimmed baking sheet with nonstick spray. Place squash on sheet. Drizzle with olive oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and toss to coat; arrange squash in single layer. Bake squash until brown and very tender when pierced with fork, stirring occasionally, about 45 minutes. Transfer to bowl.
Melt butter in small saucepan over medium-low heat until foam subsides and butter turns nut-brown, about 4 minutes. Pour over squash; stir lightly to coat. Toss with more salt and 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg. Sprinkle with more nutmeg and serve.

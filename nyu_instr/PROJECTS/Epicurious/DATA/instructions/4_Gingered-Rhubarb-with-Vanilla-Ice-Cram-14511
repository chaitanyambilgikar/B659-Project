In a microwave-safe 2-quart dish combine the rhubarb, the orange juice, the gingerroot, the sugar, and the butter, cover the dish with microwavable-safe plastic wrap, leaving one corner uncovered, and microwave the mixture at high power (100%) for 5 minutes. Stir the mixture and microwave it, covered partially, for 2 minutes, or until the rhubarb is tender. Let the mixture cool slightly, serve it with the ice cream, and garnish it with the mint. (The gingered rhubarb may also be served as a compote.)

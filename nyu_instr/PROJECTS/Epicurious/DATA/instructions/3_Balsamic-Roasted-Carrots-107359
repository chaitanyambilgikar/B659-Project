Preheat oven to 425°F.
Toss carrots with oil and salt in a shallow roasting pan (1 inch deep). Roast carrots in middle of oven, stirring occasionally, until golden and tender, 25 to 30 minutes. Drizzle vinegar over carrots and shake pan a few times. Roast carrots until most of vinegar is evaporated, about 2 minutes more.

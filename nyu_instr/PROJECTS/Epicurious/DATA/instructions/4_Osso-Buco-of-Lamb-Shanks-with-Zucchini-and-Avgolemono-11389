Preheat oven to 275°F.
In a heavy casserole large enough to hold lamb shanks in one layer without crowding arrange shanks and season with salt and pepper. Roast shanks in middle of oven, covered tightly, 3 hours, or until tender. (Meat will give off juices as it cooks.) Pour off pan juices, reserving about 1 cup, and skim fat. Keep shanks warm, covered.
In a small saucepan combine broth, reserved pan juices, water, and one-third zucchini and simmer 5 minutes, or until zucchini is tender but still bright green. In a blender purée broth mixture until smooth.
In a bowl whisk together egg and lemon juice and whisk in puréed; broth mixture. Return mixture to pan and heat over moderate heat, stirring constantly, until 170°F. on a candy thermometer and thickened slightly (do not boil). Season avgolemono with salt and pepper and keep warm.
In a large non-stick skillet heat oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and sauté remaining zucchini until crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in dill and salt and pepper to taste.
Arrange shanks on a deep platter and scatter with zucchini. Drizzle shanks with some avgolemono and serve remaining sauce separately. Serve shanks with orzo>/I>.

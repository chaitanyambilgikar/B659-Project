Add vinegar, soy sauce, sugar and cornstarch mixture and boil until sauce thickens, stirring constantly, about 1 minute. Remove from heat. Season sauce with pepper.
Preheat broiler. Brush some sauce over each side of fish fillets. Broil until just cooked through, about 3 minutes per side. Place fish on plates. Spoon rice alongside; sprinkle with onion tops. Serve, passing remaining sauce separately.

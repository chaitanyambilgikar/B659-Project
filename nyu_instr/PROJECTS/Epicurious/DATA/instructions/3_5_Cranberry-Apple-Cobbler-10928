In a shallow 2-cup baking dish toss together the cranberries, the apple, the zest, the brown sugar, the cinnamon, the cloves, and 1 tablespoon of the flour and dot the top with the butter. In a bowl stir together the remaining 1/2 cup flour, the baking powder, and the salt. Add the shortening, blend the mixture until it resembles coarse meal, and stir in the yogurt. (The dough will be sticky.) Drop the dough by spoonfuls onto the cranberry mixture, sprinkle it with the granulated sugar, and bake the cobbler in the middle of a preheated 400°F. oven for 30 minutes, or until the top is golden. Serve the cobbler with the ice cream.

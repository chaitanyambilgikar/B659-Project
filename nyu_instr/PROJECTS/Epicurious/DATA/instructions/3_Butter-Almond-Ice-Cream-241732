Whisk together cream, milk, sugar, and eggs in a heavy medium saucepan, then cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until custard is thick enough to coat back of a spoon and registers 175°F on an instant-read thermometer. Strain custard through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl. Cool completely, stirring frequently, then chill, covered, until very cold, at least 8 hours.
Meanwhile, cook almonds in butter with a scant 1/4 teaspoon salt in a heavy skillet over medium heat, stirring, until butter and almonds are pale golden, about 6 minutes. Remove from heat and cool.
Freeze custard in ice cream maker, then fold in almonds with butter. Transfer to an airtight container and put in freezer to harden.

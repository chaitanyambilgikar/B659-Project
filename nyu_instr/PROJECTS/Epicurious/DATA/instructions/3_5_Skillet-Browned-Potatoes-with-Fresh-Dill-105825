Place potatoes in large pot. Add enough cold water to cover. Bring to boil. Cover partially and cook until potatoes are just tender but still hold their shape, about 15 minutes. Drain and cool. Cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight.
Cut potatoes in half. Melt butter in very large skillet over medium-high heat. Add potatoes; cover skillet and cook until potatoes brown, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. Season generously with salt and pepper. Add dill; toss to coat. Transfer to bowl and serve.

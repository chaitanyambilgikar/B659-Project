In a small bowl whisk together the egg, the zest, the milk, the brown sugar, and 2 tablespoons of the butter. In a bowl whisk together the flour, the baking powder, and the salt, add the milk mixture, and whisk the batter until it is just combined. Stir in the blueberries. Heat a griddle over moderately high heat until it is hot enough to make drops of water scatter over its surface and brush it with some of the additional melted butter. Pour the batter onto the griddle by 1/3 cup measures and cook the pancakes for 2 minutes on each side, or until they are golden. Transfer the pancakes as they are cooked to a plate and keep them warm. Serve the pancakes with the syrup.

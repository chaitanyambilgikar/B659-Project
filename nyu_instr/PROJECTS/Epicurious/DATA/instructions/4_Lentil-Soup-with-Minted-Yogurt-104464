Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium heat. Add onions, carrots and garlic and sauté until vegetables begin to soften, about 10 minutes. Add curry, then lentils and stir 2 minutes. Add 9 cups broth and bring to boil. Reduce heat, cover and simmer until lentils are tender, adding more broth if soup is too thick and stirring occasionally, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Season soup with salt and pepper.
Whisk yogurt, mint, cilantro and basil in small bowl to blend. Season herbed yogurt with salt and pepper. (Soup and herbed yogurt can be made 1 day ahead. Cover separately and chill. Bring soup to simmer, thinning with more broth if needed, before continuing.) Ladle soup into bowls. Spoon generous dollops of herbed yogurt atop soup and serve.

Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium heat. Add bell peppers, 3/4 cup green onions, celery, carrots and red onion and sauté until vegetables are tender, about 12 minutes. Stir in tarragon and cayenne. Mix in tomatoes with juices, clam juice and wine. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer 30 minutes to blend flavors, stirring occasionally. Add cream and simmer 20 minutes longer. Stir in crabmeat. Cook until crab is heated through, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup chopped green onions and serve.

In a small bowl stir together warm water and yeast and let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes.
In a dry small heavy skillet toast fennel seeds over moderately high heat, stirring, until fragrant and several shades darker, being careful not to burn them.
In a large bowl whisk together 5 1/2 cups flour, salt, and pepper. Make a well in center and add yeast mixture, 2 tablespoons oil, fennel seeds, and liqueur. Using a wooden spoon first and then your hands, blend in liquid until a dough is formed.
On a lightly floured surface knead dough, adding flour if dough is sticky, 10 minutes, or until smooth and satiny. Put dough in a large bowl and let rise, loosely covered, in a warm place 1 hour, or until doubled in bulk.
Preheat oven to 500° F. and oil two shallow baking pans.
In a small bowl beat together egg and 2 tablespoons water to make an egg wash.
Punch dough down and roll into 1-inch balls. Arrange fennel balls about 1-inch apart in pans and brush with egg wash. Bake fennel balls 10 minutes, or until golden, and cool.
Just before serving, in a large skillet heat 2 tablespoons oil over moderate heat until hot but not smoking and heat half of fennel rolls, stirring, 2 minutes, or until heated through. Transfer fennel rolls as heated to a basket lined with paper towels and sprinkle with salt, tossing to coat. Repeat procedure with remaining 2 tablespoons oil and fennel rolls.

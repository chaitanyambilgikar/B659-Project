Combine broth, all herbs, garlic and salt in heavy large saucepan and bring to boil over medium-high heat. Gradually sprinkle in polenta, whisking constantly. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer until polenta is thick and creamy and begins to pull away from sides of pan, whisking often, about 25 minutes. Add cheese; stir until cheese melts. Season with salt and pepper and serve.
*If unavailable, use 1 2/3 cups regular cornmeal and cook for about 12 minutes.

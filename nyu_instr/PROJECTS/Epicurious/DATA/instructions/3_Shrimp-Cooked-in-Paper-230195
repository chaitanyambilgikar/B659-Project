Preheat oven to 350°F. Peel and core 2 apples. Wrap each in a sheet of aluminum foil and bake 35 minutes on a cookie sheet. Core third apple and cut into 8 slices. In a nonstick pan, sauté slices in butter, 3 minutes per side. Remove pan from heat. Cut each parchment sheet into a heart, keeping shapes as large as possible (18-inch width). Brush one side of each heart with egg white. Unwrap baked apples, place in bowl and mash with a fork. Heat oven to 400°F. Spoon 1/2 cup mashed apples into a rectangle in the center of one half of each heart. Position 4 apple slices alternating with 4 shrimp atop mashed apples. Season with salt and pepper. Layer 2 Gruyère slices on each arrangement. Fold heart, crimp edges to seal and bake 6 to 8 minutes on a cookie sheet. Transfer to plates and open right before serving.

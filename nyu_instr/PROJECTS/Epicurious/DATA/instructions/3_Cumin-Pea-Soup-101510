In a dry small heavy skillet toast cumin seeds over moderate heat, shaking skillet frequently, until a shade darker and fragrant, 3 to 5 minutes, and cool. With a mortar and pestle or in an electric coffee/spice grinder finely grind seeds.
Finely chop onion and in a 2-quart saucepan simmer onion in broth and water until soft. Add peas, half of cumin, and half of salt and simmer, uncovered, until peas are tender, about 5 minutes. In a blender purée soup in 2 batches until smooth (use caution when blending hot liquids) and transfer to another saucepan.
In a small bowl stir together remaining cumin and salt to use as garnish.

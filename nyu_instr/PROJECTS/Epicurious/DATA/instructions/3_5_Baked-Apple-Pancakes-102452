Preheat oven to 450°F. Toss apple slices with lemon juice in medium bowl.
Whisk eggs and milk in large bowl to blend. Add flour, 1 tablespoon sugar and salt; whisk until batter is almost smooth (small lumps of flour will remain).
Mix brown sugar, cinnamon and remaining 1/4 cup sugar in small bowl.
Melt 1 tablespoon butter in each of two 6-inch ovenproof nonstick skillets over medium heat. Pour half of batter into each skillet. Arrange half of apple slices evenly over batter in each skillet.
Transfer skillets to oven and bake until pancakes are set around edges but still wet in center, about 8 minutes. Remove from oven; sprinkle half of brown sugar mixture over each pancake. Dot each with 1 tablespoon butter. Using spatula, carefully turn pancakes over. Return to oven. Bake until pancakes rise, sugar mixture melts to sauce consistency and top of pancakes is golden, about 6 minutes. Invert onto plates. Serve warm.

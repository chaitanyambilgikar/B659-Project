Yummy chocolate cookies: 1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Lightly grease 2 baking sheets.
2. Sift the fl our, cocoa powder, baking powder, espresso, and salt into a bowl. Reserve.
3. In another bowl, cream the butter and sugar with an electric mixer until it is light and fluffy. Add the egg and the vanilla, then mix well.
4. Add the reserved dry ingredients and mix until just combined.
5. Form 1/4-cup portions of dough into 8 balls. Arrange 4 balls on each cookie sheet and flatten with a spatula.
6. Bake in the center of the oven until set, about 10 minutes. Let stand on the baking sheet for 2 minutes before removing with a spatula to a wire rack to cool completely.
How to add mix-ins to your ice cream: Soften a 14-ounces container of vanilla ice cream in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. Place the ice cream in a bowl and swirl in ingredients. You’ll get the best results if you use a dinner knife to stir. Return the mixture to the freezer to harden, about 1 hour.
To assemble the ice cream sandwiches: Place a scoop of ice cream on the bottom cookie. Gently press a second cookie over the ice cream. For even more variations, pat chopped nuts, shaved chocolate, toasted coconut, chopped M&M’s, or sprinkles onto the sides of the sandwiches. Or spread jam on the inside of the cookies for another layer of fl avor. Freeze until ready to serve. The ice cream variations and sandwiches are best eaten the day they are made.

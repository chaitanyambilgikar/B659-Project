Make soup: Soak beans in cold water to cover overnight (8 hours). Drain and rinse well.
Simmer ham hocks in 6 cups water in a 3-quart saucepan, partially covered, skimming foam as necessary, 1 hour. Reserve 4 cups cooking liquid and drain ham hocks.
Heat bacon drippings in an 8-quart heavy pot over moderate heat until hot but not smoking, then cook onion and garlic, stirring, until softened. Add tomatoes and thyme and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add soaked beans, broth, ham hocks, and reserved cooking liquid and simmer, covered, stirring occasionally, until beans are tender, about 1 hour.
Make croutons while soup simmers: Preheat oven to 375°F.
Melt butter with garlic and toss together with corn bread cubes in a shallow baking pan. Toast in middle of oven until lightly browned and crisp on the outside, about 15 minutes.
Prepare soup for serving: Remove ham hocks and shred meat. Return meat to soup and stir in arugula. Simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until greens are tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Season with salt, pepper, and Tabasco.
Serve soup topped with croutons.

Cook lobsters (if necessary): Plunge 2 lobsters headfirst into a 10- to 12-quart pot of boiling salted water (see Tips, page 129) and cook, covered, 6 minutes for 1 1/4-pound lobsters or 7 minutes for 1 1/2-pound lobsters, from time lobsters enter water. Transfer with tongs to sink to drain. Return water to a boil and cook remaining lobsters in 2 batches in same manner.
When lobsters are cool enough to handle, remove meat from tail and claws. Discard tomalley, any roe, and shells, then scrape off any coagulated white albumin from meat with point of a small knife. Cut meat into 3/4-inch pieces and chill, covered, at least 1 hour.
Make dressing: Blend lime juice, brown sugar, mustard, and salt in a blender until combined. With motor running, add oil in a slow, steady stream and blend until dressing is emulsified. Chill, covered, until ready to use.
Prepare noodles: Soak noodles in cold water until pliable, about 15 minutes, then drain in a colander. Cut noodles in half with kitchen shears.
Cook noodles in a 4-quart pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until just tender, about 2 minutes. Drain noodles well and rinse under cold water until cool, then drain well again.
Assemble salad: Stir together lobster, herbs, and 6 tablespoons dressing.
Toss together noodles, jicama, remaining dressing, and table salt to taste, then divide among 6 plates and top each serving with a mound of lobster salad. Sprinkle with sea salt and serve immediately.

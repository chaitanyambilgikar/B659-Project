Pat salmon dry and season with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then cook salmon, turning once, until just cooked through, about 7 minutes. Transfer salmon to a platter.
Cook shallot in skillet over moderate heat, stirring, until softened. Stir in peperoncini, half-and-half, parsley, and 1 tablespoon dill and simmer until sauce is slightly thickened, about 3 minutes. Stir in remaining tablespoon dill and salt and pepper to taste.
Pour sauce over salmon and serve with lemon wedges.

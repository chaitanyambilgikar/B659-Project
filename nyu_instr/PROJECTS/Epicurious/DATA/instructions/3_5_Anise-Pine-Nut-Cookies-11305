In a bowl with an electric mixer cream together the butter, the shortening, and the sugars until mixture is light and fluffy and beat in the vanilla. In another bowl whisk together the flour, the salt, and the baking powder and add the flour mixture to the butter mixture. In a food processor or blender grind fine the aniseed and 1/2 cup of the pine nuts, add the mixture to the dough, and blend the dough well.
Drop teaspoons of dough 2 inches apart onto greased baking sheets, top each cookie with several of the remaining pine nuts, and bake the cookies in a preheated 325°F. oven, switching the positions of the baking sheets halfway through the cooking time for 18 to 20 minutes, or until they are golden. Let the cookies cool on the baking sheets for 2 minutes, transfer them carefully (the cookies are very delicate) with a metal spatula to racks, and let them cool completely. The cookies keep in an airtight container for 4 days.

In a heavy skillet cook garlic and red pepper flakes in butter over moderately low heat, stirring, 1 minute. Add mushrooms, Sherry, and teriyaki sauce and cook over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms are tender. Transfer mushrooms with a slotted spoon to a bowl and boil liquid until reduced to a thick glaze. Return mushrooms to skillet and stir to coat with glaze. Stir in parsley and salt and pepper to taste.

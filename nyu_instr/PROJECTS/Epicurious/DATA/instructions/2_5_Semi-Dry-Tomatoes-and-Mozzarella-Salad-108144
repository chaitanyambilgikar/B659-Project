Preheat the oven to 250 °F. Line a cookie sheet with aluminum foil. Arrange the tomato halves cut side up on the sheet, and sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon of the salt on top. Bake for 4 hours.
Remove the tomatoes from the oven (they will still be soft), and put them in a serving bowl. Let them cool, then add the mozzarella, capers, remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, pepper, garlic, olive oil, and lemon rind, and mix to combine.
Drop the basil leaves into 2 cups of boiling water, and cook for about 10 seconds. Drain, and cool under cold running water. Press the basil between your palms to extrude most of the water, then chop finely. Add to the salad, toss well, and serve.

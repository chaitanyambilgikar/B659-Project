With a paring knife make a 1/8-inch deep slit down the length of each yuca section and with the aid of the knife pry off the brown and the white layers. In a food processor fitted with the 1-mm. slicing disk slice the yuca crosswise. In a kettle heat 1-1/2 inches of the oil to 375°F. on a deep-fat thermometer. Separating the yuca slices, drop them, 1 at a time, into the oil and fry them in batches, turning them, for 1 to 2 minutes, or until they are pale golden, transferring them as they are fried to paper towels to drain. In a small bowl stir together the chili powder, the salt, and the cayenne and in a large bowl toss the chips with the spice mixture.

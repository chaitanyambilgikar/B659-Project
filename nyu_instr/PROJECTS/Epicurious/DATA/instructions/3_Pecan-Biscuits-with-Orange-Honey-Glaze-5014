Make glaze: Mix in orange juice and honey in heavy small saucepan; bring to boil. Reduce heat; simmer until slightly thickened, about 3 minutes. Set aside.
Make biscuits: Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 425°F. Combine flour, baking powder, orange peel, baking soda, salt and ginger in large bowl. Add butter and rub in with fingertips until mixture resembles coarse meal. Mix in 1/2 cup chopped pecans. Whisk yogurt and 3 tablespoons honey in small bowl to blend. Add yogurt mixture to dry ingredients; stir with fork until mist dough forms. Turn out dough onto floured surface and knead gently just until smooth, about 10 turns (do not overmix).
Roll out dough to 10-inch-diameter round (about 3 /4 inch thick). Using 2 1/2-inch-diameter biscuit or cookie cutter, cut out biscuits. Gather scraps; roll out to 3/4-inch thickness and cut out additional biscuits. Transfer biscuits to large ungreased baking sheet. Brush tops of biscuits twice with glaze; sprinkle with 1/4 cup pecans. Bake until puffed and golden brown and tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 18 minutes. Serve warm. (Can be prepared 6 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature. Rewarm in 350°F oven just until heated through, about 5 minutes.)

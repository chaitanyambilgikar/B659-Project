Preheat oven to 375°F. Combine oil and garlic in custard cup. Cover with foil; bake until garlic is soft, about 35 minutes.
Meanwhile, cook malanga in large saucepan of boiling salted water until very tender, about 35 minutes; drain. Transfer malanga to large mixing bowl. Add 1 cup broth and roasted garlic with oil and beat with electric mixer until fluffy and almost smooth, adding more broth by tablespoonfuls for desired texture. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

1. Rinse the eggs under warm water. Place in a saucepan and cover with cold salted water. Bring to a boil and cook for 4 minutes. Drain, rinse under cold water and peel. Pat dry.
2. Cut the eggs in half lengthwise. Scoop out the yolks with a very small spoon into a bowl; mash. Mix with mayonnaise, mustard, Tabasco sauce and salt. Carefully fill the whites with the yolk mixture. Sprinkle with chives and arrange on a decorative cocktail tray.

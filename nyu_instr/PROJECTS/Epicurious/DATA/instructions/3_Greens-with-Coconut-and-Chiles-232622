Stir together coconut and 1/2 cup water in a bowl. Let soak at room temperature until water is absorbed, about 1 hour. Stir in cumin, turmeric, and 1/2 cup water until combined. Smash green chiles and garlic with flat side of a large knife and stir into coconut mixture.
Heat oil in wok over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then add mustard seeds and fry until they make popping sounds, about 15 seconds. Add rice and red chiles and cook, stirring constantly, until rice is golden, about 1 minute.
Add chard and salt and cook, stirring, until chard is wilted, about 30 seconds. Stir in coconut mixture and remaining 1/2 cup water and bring to a simmer. Cover chard mixture directly with banana leaf if using, then lid, and simmer until stems are crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Discard banana leaf and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until liquid is evaporated and mixture is dry, 5 to 7 minutes.

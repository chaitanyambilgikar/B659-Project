In a bowl beat the eggs until they are frothy and stir in the olives and 2 tablespoons of the oil. Into the bowl sift together the flour, the sugar, the baking powder, and the salt, add the milk, and stir the mixture until it is just combined. Brush an 8 1/2- by 4 1/2-inch loaf pan with the additional oil, transfer the batter to the pan, and bake the bread in the middle of a preheated 350°F. oven for 1 hour, or until a tester comes out clean. Let the bread cool in the pan for 10 minutes and turn it out onto a rack.

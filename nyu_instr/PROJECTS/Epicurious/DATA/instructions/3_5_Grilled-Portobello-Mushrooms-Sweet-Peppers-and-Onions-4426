Prepare barbeque (medium-high heat). Whisk vinegar, oil, thyme and lemon peel in large bowl to blend well. Season vinaigrette to taste with salt and pepper.
Brush vinaigrette over vegetables. Grill until mushrooms are tender and juicy, and peppers and onions are crisp-tender, about 12 minutes per side.
Cut mushrooms and peppers into 1/2-inch-thick strips. Toss mushrooms, peppers and onions in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Serve at room temperature.

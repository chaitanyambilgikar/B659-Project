Cut each chayote lengthwise into 1/2-inch wedges and discard seed if necessary. In a 12-inch heavy skillet heat oil over moderate heat until hot but not smoking and cook chayotes, stirring occasionally, until crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Add cream and simmer until chayotes are tender and cream is slightly thickened, about 3 minutes. Add chives and season with salt.

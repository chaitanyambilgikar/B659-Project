In a bowl whisk together well the cornmeal, the flour,the baking powder, the cayenne, the salt, and the cumin, whisk in the milk and the yolk, and stir in the Cheddar and the beans. In another bowl beat the whites until they hold soft peaks and fold them into the Cheddar mixture thoroughly. Heat 1/8 inch of the oil in a well-seasoned cast-iron or non-stick skillet over moderately high heat until it is hot but not smoking. Working in batches, drop heaping tablespoons of the batter into the skillet, spreading them slightly, fry the fritters for 1 minute on each side, or until they are golden brown, and let them drain on paper towels. Serve the fritters with the sour cream and the tomato salsa.

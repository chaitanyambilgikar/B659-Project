Cook onions in large saucepan of boiling water 1 minute. Drain and cool. Cut off root ends, then peel. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
Combine onions and cream in heavy large skillet. Bring to boil over medium-high heat. Cover; boil until onions are almost tender, about 8 minutes. Uncover; boil until liquid is slightly reduced, about 4 minutes. Add bell pepper and zucchini. Cover; cook until almost tender, about 5 minutes. Add corn; reduce heat and simmer uncovered until vegetables are tender and sauce thickens, stirring occasionally, 6 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.

Combine half and half, eggs, sugar, brandy, cinnamon, and salt in 13x9x2-inch glass baking dish; whisk custard to blend well. Spread 2 tablespoons preserves on each of 4 croissant halves; top each with plain croissant half, pressing to adhere. Place croissants in custard; turn to coat. Let soak until custard is absorbed, turning and basting often, about 30 minutes.
Melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add croissants; sauté until cooked through and browned, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer croissants to plates. Add blueberries to same skillet. Sauté until heated through, about 3 minutes. Spoon berries over croissants. Serve with maple syrup.

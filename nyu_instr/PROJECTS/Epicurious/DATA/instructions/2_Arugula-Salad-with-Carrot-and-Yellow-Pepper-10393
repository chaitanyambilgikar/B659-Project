In a small bowl whisk together the vinegar and salt and black pepper to taste, add the oil in a stream, whisking, and whisk the dressing until it is emulsified. In a large bowl combine the lettuce, the arugula, the carrot, and the bell pepper, drizzle the dressing over the salad, and toss the salad until it is combined well.

Preheat oven to 450°F with rack in middle.
Put fish in an oiled shallow baking dish and sprinkle with teaspoon each of salt and pepper.
Force garlic through a garlic press into a bowl, then whisk in oil and 1/8 teaspoon salt. Whisk in mayonnaise and spread over fish.
Bake, uncovered, until fish is just cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes.

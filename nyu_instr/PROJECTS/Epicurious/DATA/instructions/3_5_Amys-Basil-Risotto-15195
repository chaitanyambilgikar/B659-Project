In a food processor mince basil and sage with Parmigiano-Reggiano. In a saucepan bring broth to a simmer and keep at a bare simmer.
Finely chop onions. In a 4- to 5-quart heavy kettle cook onions in 1/4 cup oil, covered, over moderately low heat, stirring occasionally, until soft but not browned, about 10 minutes. Add rice and cook, uncovered, over low heat, stirring, 10 minutes. Increase heat to moderate and add wine. Cook mixture, stirring constantly, until wine is absorbed. Stir in 1 cup simmering broth and cook at a strong simmer, stirring constantly, until broth is absorbed. Continue adding broth, about 1/2 cup at a time, and cooking mixture at a strong simmer, stirring constantly and letting each addition be absorbed before adding the next, until rice is tender and creamy-looking but still al dente, about 18 minutes total. (There may be broth left over.)
Remove kettle from heat and stir in herb mixture, remaining tablespoon oil, and salt and pepper to taste.
Serve risotto immediately.

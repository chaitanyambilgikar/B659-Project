Preheat broiler. Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite.
While pasta cooks, make crumb topping: Mix first 3 ingredients in small bowl. Melt butter in heavy medium skillet over medium heat. Add breadcrumb mixture and sauté until golden and coated with butter, about 2 minutes.
Drain pasta well. Add to sauce along with prosciutto, chives, parsley and 1 teaspoon truffle oil; toss to coat. Mix in additional truffle oil, if desired. Divide macaroni and cheese among 8 individual gratin dishes. Top each with Crumb Topping. Broil until topping is crisp and golden brown, about 2 minutes, and serve.

For plums: Combine all ingredients in large skillet; toss to coat. Cover and cook over medium-high heat until sugar dissolves, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Uncover and cook until plums are tender but still hold shape, stirring occasionally, about 3 minutes longer; cool to room temperature. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Transfer to bowl. Cover and chill.)
For meringues: Preheat oven to 350°F. Line large baking sheet with parchment paper. Using electric mixer, beat egg whites in large bowl 1 minute. Add cream of tartar. Continue to beat until soft peaks form. Gradually add sugar, beating until whites are thick and resemble marshmallow creme, about 5 minutes. Beat in cornstarch, vinegar, vanilla, and cardamom. Drop meringue onto prepared sheet in 6 mounds, spaced 3 inches apart. Using back of spoon, make depression in center of each.
Place meringues in oven. Immediately reduce temperature to 250°F. Bake until meringues are dry outside (but centers remain soft) and pale straw color and lift easily from parchment, about 50 minutes. Cool on sheet on rack. (Can be made 8 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.)
For topping: Beat crème fraîche and sugar in medium bowl until peaks form. Refrigerate up to 2 hours.
Place meringues on plates. Spoon plum mixture into center depression. Spoon topping and any plum juices over.
*Sold at some supermarkets. If unavailable, heat 1 1/2 cups whipping cream to lukewarm (85°F). Remove from heat and mix in 3 tablespoons buttermilk. Cover and let stand in warm draft-free area until slightly thickened, 24 to 48 hours. Refrigerate until ready to use.

Place the sugar in a large jar that can be made airtight. Stick the vanilla beans right down into the sugar. Close the jar and forget about it for one week, then proceed to use the sugar. Replace the sugar as you use it, stirring it in the jar. The vanilla beans will continue to add their flavor to the sugar for up to three months.

Bring water and 1/2 cup sugar to a boil in a small heavy saucepan, stirring until sugar has dissolved, then simmer, uncovered, 2 minutes. Remove from heat.
Put remaining 1/4 cup sugar in a small bowl.
Lightly brush cranberries and both sides of sage leaves with sugar syrup, then immediately roll in sugar.
Transfer to a lightly oiled rack and dry at room temperature, 2 to 3 hours.

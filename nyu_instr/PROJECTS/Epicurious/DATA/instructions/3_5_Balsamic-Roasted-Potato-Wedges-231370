Put oven rack in lower third of oven and preheat oven to 450°F.
Halve each potato lengthwise, then cut each half lengthwise into 4 wedges. Toss potato wedges with oil, salt, and pepper in a 17- by 11-inch shallow baking pan (about 1 inch deep) and arrange in 1 layer. Roast potatoes, turning over once, until golden brown and cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes.
Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons vinegar, shaking pan to distribute vinegar evenly, then roast until vinegar is evaporated, about 3 minutes.
Serve sprinkled with remaining 1/2 tablespoon vinegar and salt to taste.

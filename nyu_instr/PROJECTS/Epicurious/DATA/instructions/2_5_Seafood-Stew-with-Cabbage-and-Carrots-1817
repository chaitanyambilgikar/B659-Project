Boil clam juice, onion, Riesling, garlic and thyme in heavy Dutch oven 15 minutes. Add clams. Cover and cook until clams open, about 6 minutes. Using tongs, transfer clams to bowl. Discard any clams that do not open. Add fish, shrimp and scallops to Dutch oven and simmer until seafood is just cooked through, about 3 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer fish, shrimp and scallops to bowl with clams. Add cream and boil until liquid is reduced to 3/4 cup, about 25 minutes.
Meanwhile, melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add cabbage and carrot and sauté until cabbage wilts, about 4 minutes.
Return shellfish mixture to Dutch oven and stir to heat through. Divide cabbage mixture between 2 shallow soup bowls. Ladle shellfish stew over.

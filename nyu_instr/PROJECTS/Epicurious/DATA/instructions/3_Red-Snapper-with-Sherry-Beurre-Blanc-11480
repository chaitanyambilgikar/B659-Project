In a small saucepan cook the Sherry, the shallot, the white wine, the vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste over moderately high heat until the liquid is reduced to about 2 tablespoons, remove the pan from the heat, and whisk in the butter, 1 piece at a time, adding each new piece before the previous one has melted completely. (The sauce should not get hot enough to liquefy. It should be the consistency of thin hollandaise.)
On a foil-covered broiler pan broil the fillets under a preheated broiler about 4 inches from the heat for 4 to 5 minutes, or until they just flake, divide them between 2 plates, and spoon the sauce over them.

Whisk eggs, herbs, salt and pepper in medium bowl to blend. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in 9- to 10-inch-diameter nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add half of egg mixture to skillet and cook until very softly set, tilting skillet, running rubber spatula around edges and allowing uncooked egg portion to flow underneath, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle half of goat cheese over. Cover and cook until omelet is set, about 2 minutes. Tilt skillet and slide out omelet onto plate, folding omelet in half. Cover to keep warm. Repeat for second omelet with remaining butter, egg mixture and goat cheese. Serve immediately.

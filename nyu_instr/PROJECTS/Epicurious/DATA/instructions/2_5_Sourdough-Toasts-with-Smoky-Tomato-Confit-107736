Cook onion in 3 tablespoons oil in a 10-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, 4 minutes. Reduce heat to low and cook, covered, stirring occasionally, until onion is golden and soft, 8 to 10 minutes more. Add tomatoes, paprika, sugar, and salt and cook, uncovered, over moderately low heat, stirring frequently, until mixture is very thick (jamlike), 25 to 30 minutes. Purée in a blender or food processor, then transfer to a bowl to cool.
Preheat oven to 350°F.
Brush both sides of bread slices with remaining 3 tablespoons oil, then arrange in 1 layer on a baking sheet and bake, turning once, until lightly toasted, about 15 minutes total.
Serve toasts with confit.

Preheat oven to 350°F. Arrange six 3/4-cup custard cups in 13x9x2-inch baking pan. Combine condensed milk and evaporated milk in medium saucepan and bring to simmer, stirring often. Remove from heat; add chocolate, cream cheese, Kahlúa, cinnamon, and salt. Whisk until chocolate is melted and mixture is smooth. Whisk in eggs.
Divide flan mixture among custard cups. Pour enough hot water into baking pan to come halfway up sides of cups. Bake flans until set in center, about 35 minutes. Remove flans from water bath and chill uncovered until very cold and firm, at least 3 hours and up to 1 day.

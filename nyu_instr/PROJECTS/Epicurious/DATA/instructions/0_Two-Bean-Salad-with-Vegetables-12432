In a bowl whisk together oil, lemon juice, pepper, and salt to taste. Add black beans, tomatoes, celery, and radishes and toss to combine.(Salad may be prepared up to this point 2 days ahead and chilled, covered.)
In a 3-quart saucepan of boiling salted water cook green beans until just tender, about 5 minutes, and drain in a colander. Cut beans into 1 1/2-inch pieces and stir into salad. Serve salad at room temperature.

Rinse peas and combine in a 6- to 8-quart heavy pot with water, salt pork, and half of onions. Bring to a boil, skimming froth, then reduce heat and simmer, partially covered, until peas are tender but not falling apart, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.
Cook leek and remaining onions in butter in a large heavy skillet over moderate heat, stirring, until softened, about 10 minutes. Add to soup along with chives, savory, salt, and pepper and continue to simmer, partially covered, until peas are falling apart and soup is thickened, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Remove ham bone or ham hock, if using, then shred meat and return meat to soup.

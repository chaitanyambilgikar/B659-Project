1. In a small saucepan over moderate heat, combine the sugar with 1 cup water and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally, to dissolve the sugar. Remove the syrup from the heat and let cool completely.
2. In a blender or food processor, combine the berries with 1/2 cup water and blend until smooth (add a bit more water, 1 to 2 tablespoons at a time, as needed to keep the mixture smooth). Combine the fruit purée, cooled syrup, and lemon juice and stir to combine.
3. Transfer the mixture to an ice cream machine and freeze according to the manufacturer's instructions. Pack the sorbet into containers, cover, and freeze for 3 to 4 hours before serving.

In small bowl, combine pecans and wine. In large bowl, whip cream until it holds soft peaks.
Spoon 1 scoop vanilla ice cream into each of 6 glass serving dishes or parfait glasses. Top each with 1 tablespoon dates and 1 tablespoon pecan mixture. Next, top each with 1 scoop sherbet and remaining pecan mixture. Finish each glass with whipped cream and remaining dates, and garnish each with 1 sprig of mint. Serve immediately.

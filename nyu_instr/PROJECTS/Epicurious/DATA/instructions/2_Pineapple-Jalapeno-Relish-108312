Combine all ingredients in large bowl. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Cook mixture in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until almost all liquid evaporates, stirring occasionally, about 4 minutes. Cool and serve at room temperature. (Relish can be made 1 day ahead; refrigerate. Bring to room temperature before serving.)

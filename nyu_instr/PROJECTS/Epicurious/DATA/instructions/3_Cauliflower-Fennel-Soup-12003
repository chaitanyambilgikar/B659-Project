Cut cauliflower into 2-inch pieces, discarding outer leaves and core. In a 2- to 3-quart heavy saucepan simmer cauliflower with garlic and fennel seeds in water, covered, until cauliflower is very tender, about 10 minutes. Cool mixture 15 minutes and in a blender purée in batches, transferring to a bowl. In pan stir together purée, cream, and salt and pepper to taste and heat soup over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until heated through.

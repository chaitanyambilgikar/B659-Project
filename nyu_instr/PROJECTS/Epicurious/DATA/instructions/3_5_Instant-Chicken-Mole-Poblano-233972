Combine rice, water, and salt in a 2-quart heavy saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and cook, covered, until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, about 18 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand, covered and undisturbed, 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork.
While rice cooks, blend mole and broth in a blender until smooth, then bring to a boil in a 12-inch skillet, stirring occasionally. Add chicken, then reduce heat and cook at a bare simmer, uncovered, turning chicken once, until just cooked through, about 15 minutes total (sauce will thicken slightly).

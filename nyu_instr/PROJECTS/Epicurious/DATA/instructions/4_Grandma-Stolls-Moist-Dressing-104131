Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease a 9x13x2-inch ovenproof serving dish or spray with nonstick spray.
Put the turkey giblets in a medium pot, add 1 1/2 cups broth, place over high heat, and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, uncovered, for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, adding water if the liquid boils out. Strain and reserve the broth. Coarsely chop the giblets, removing any bones or extra fat. You should have about 1 cup giblets.
In a large bowl, mix together the turkey giblets and the bread. In a large skillet on medium-high heat, heat the butter until it sings (is foamy). Add the onions and celery and cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Pour into the bread mixture. Stir in the poultry seasoning, parsley, salt, and pepper, and enough reserved giblet broth to moisten the mixture, adding plain broth, if necessary, so that you are using about 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 cups all together. Toss thoroughly and pour the dressing into the prepared dish. Bake 30 minutes, adding more stock as needed to keep the dressing moist.
The dressing can be refrigerated up to 3 days or frozen for up to 3 months. Let it defrost in the refrigerator overnight, cover with foil, and reheat at 350°F. for 30 minutes.

Trim the root ends of the radishes so that the radishes stand securely and with a 1/2-inch melon-ball cutter scoop out a small cavity from each stem end, dropping the radishes as they are cut into a bowl of ice water. (The radishes may be prepared 4 hours ahead and kept chilled in the ice water.)
In a food processor fitted with the steel blade or in a bowl with an electric mixer, cream the butter and the blue cheese and transfer the mixture to a pastry bag fitted with a medium star tip. Transfer the radishes cavity side down to paper towels and let them drain for 5 minutes. Invert the radishes, pipe the blue cheese butter decoratively into them, and arrange the radishes on a jelly-roll pan. Chill the radishes for 1 to 2 hours, or unitl the filling is firm. Arrange the hors d'oeuvres decoratively on a platter.

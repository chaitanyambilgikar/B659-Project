Peel potatoes, and cut them into 2- inch pieces. Place them in a bowl covered with cold water, and soak for 10 minutes to remove starchiness; drain.
Fill a large stockpot about three-quarters full with water, and bring to a boil. Add potatoes and 1 teaspoon salt; cook until tender (about 18 minutes). Drain thoroughly in a colander. To further remove moisture (no one wants watery mashed potatoes), return potatoes to the pot on medium to high heat for a minute or two, turning them constantly so they don't burn.
For the smoothest results, put them through a ricer. If you don't have one, apply a lot of elbow grease to a potato masher. Do not mash them in a food processor or blender; it ruins the fluffy texture. Add 3 tablespoons schmaltz per pound of potatoes, and season with salt and pepper to taste.

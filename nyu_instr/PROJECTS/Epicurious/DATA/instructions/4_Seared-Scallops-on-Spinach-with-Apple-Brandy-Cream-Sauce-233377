Heat 1/2 tablespoon olive oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add shallot; stir 30 seconds. Add Calvados (brandy may ignite); boil 30 seconds. Add cream; boil 2 minutes. Transfer sauce base to bowl. (Sauce base can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.)
Preheat oven to 300°F. Sprinkle scallops with salt and pepper. Heat vegetable oil in another large nonstick skillet over high heat. Add 8 scallops.
Cook until brown, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to rimmed baking sheet; place in oven to keep warm. Repeat with remaining scallops. Add apple juice and thyme to hot skillet. Boil 1 minute, scraping up brown bits. Add sauce base; bring to boil. Remove from heat.
Heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add garlic and stir 30 seconds. Add spinach; toss until barely wilted and still bright green, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Using tongs, mound spinach in center of 8 plates, dividing equally.
Arrange 2 scallops on spinach on each plate. Pour any collected juices from baking sheet into sauce in skillet. Boil until thickened, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper; spoon over scallops.

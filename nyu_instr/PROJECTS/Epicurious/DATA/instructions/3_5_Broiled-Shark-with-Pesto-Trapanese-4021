With processor running, drop garlic through feed tube; process until chopped. Scrape down sides of bowl. Add basil and almonds; chop finely. Add tomatoes, oil and olives; process using on/off turns until mixture resembles coarse paste (do not purée). Season with salt and pepper. (Pesto can be made 4 hours ahead. Cover and chill.)
Preheat oven to 400°F. Lightly oil large baking sheet. Arrange shark steaks on prepared sheet. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Spread 3 to 4 tablespoons pesto over each steak. Cover each with 1 tablespoon breadcrumbs. Bake until fish is just opaque in center, about 10 minutes.
Preheat broiler. Broil fish until crumbs on top begin to brown, about 2 minutes. Transfer fish to plates. Serve, passing remaining pesto separately, if desired.

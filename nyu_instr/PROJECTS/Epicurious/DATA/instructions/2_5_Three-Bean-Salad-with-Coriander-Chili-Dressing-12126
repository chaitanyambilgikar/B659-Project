In a large saucepan combine the black beans with triple their volume of cold water and in another large saucepan combine the white beans with the same proportion of cold water. Bring the water to a boil and simmer the beans, uncovered, for 2 minutes. Remove the pans from the heat and let the beans soak for 1 hour. Drain each pan of beans separately in a colander. In each pan put 2 1/2 quarts water and stir the black beans into the water in one pan, the white beans into the water in the other. Cook the beans at a bare simmer, testing for doneness every 5 minutes, for 15 to 40 minutes, or until they are just tender but still hold their shape. Drain the beans and let them cool to warm.
In a blender purée 1 of the garlic cloves, the jalapeños, and 1 cup of the coriander with 1/3 cup of the lemon juice, 2/3 cup of the oil, and salt to taste, scraping down the side of the blender, until the dressing is smooth. In a very large bowl toss the beans with the dressing and let them marinate, covered and chilled, stirring occasionally, overnight. The salad may be prepared up to this point 1 day in advance and kept covered and chilled.
In a saucepan of boiling salted water boil the green beans for 5 minutes, or until they are crisp-tender, and drain them in a colander. Refresh the beans under cold water and pat them dry. In the blender purée the remaining garlic clove and the remaining 1 cup coriander with the remaining 2 tablespoons lemon juice, the remaining 1/3 cup oil, and salt to taste, scraping down the side of the blender, until the dressing is smooth. Add the green beans and the dressing to the bowl of dressed beans, toss the salad well, and serve at room temperature.

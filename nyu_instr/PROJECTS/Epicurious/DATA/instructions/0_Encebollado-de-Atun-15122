Place the yuca in a large stockpot and add water to cover. Bring to a boil, then decrease the heat and simmer gently for about 30 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool in the water.
Heat the oil in a separate stockpot over high heat. Add the onion and half of the tomatoes and cook for 10 minutes. Add the garlic and stock, and bring to a boil. Decrease the heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes. Add the tuna and yuca and cook for 5 minutes.
Stir in the parsley and cilantro and season to taste with salt and pepper. Immediately ladle the soup into bowls. Float some of the red onion slices on the surface of each soup, and top with the remaining diced tomatoes. Squeeze lime juice over the onions and sprinkle the corn nuts over the onions and tomatoes. Serve with the remaining lime wedges on the side.

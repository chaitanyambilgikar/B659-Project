Very thinly slice zucchini with slicer and place in a large sieve set over a bowl. Toss zucchini with 3/4 tsp salt and drain 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, blanch snow peas in a pot of boiling salted water (2 Tbsp salt for 4 qt water) 1 1/2 minutes. Drain and immediately plunge snow peas into an ice bath to stop cooking. Drain again and pat dry.
Rinse zucchini under cold running water, then press gently to remove any excess liquid. Pat dry.
Toast sesame seeds in a dry small skillet over medium heat, shaking skillet occasionally, until golden, about 2 minutes, then cool.

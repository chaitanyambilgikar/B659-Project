Place the shrimp and baking soda in a bowl and mix well to coat. Allow to rest for at least 20 minutes.
Place the water and 1 tablespoon salt in a pot, cover, and bring to a boil over high heat. Add the shrimp and water-blanch for 10 seconds. Remove the shrimp with a strainer and run cold water through them to cool. The water-blanching removes all of the liquid from the shrimp.
Place the shrimp in a dish, sprinkle with cornstarch to coat them lightly, and shake off excess. Heat a wok over high heat for 1 minute, add the peanut oil, and heat to 350 degrees F. Place the shrimp in a Chinese strainer, lower into the oil, and oil-blanch for 1 minute. Turn off the heat, remove with the strainer, and drain. Transfer the oil from the wok to a bowl.
Return 1 tablespoon of the reserved oil to the wok and heat over high heat for 20 seconds. Add the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and the chilies and cook, stirring, for 45 seconds. Add the shrimp and cook, stirring, making certain they are well coated, for 1 minute. They should be dry and crusted. Turn off the heat, transfer to a heated platter, and serve.

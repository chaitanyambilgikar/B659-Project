In a kettle cover the beets by 2 inches with cold water, bring the water to a boil, and simmer the beets, covered, for 20 to 30 minutes, or until they are tender. Drain the beets and under cold water slip off and discard the skins and stems. Cut the beets into wedges, in a bowl combine them well with the horseradish, the sugar, the vinegar, the water, and salt and pepper to taste, and let them marinate, covered and chilled, for at least 8 hours and up to 3 days.

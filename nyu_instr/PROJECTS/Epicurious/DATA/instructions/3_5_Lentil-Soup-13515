In a heavy saucepan cook the carrot, the onion, the garlic, and the bay leaf in the oil over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are softened. Stir in the broth and the lentils and simmer the mixture, covered partially, stirring occasionally, for 25 minutes. Stir in the ham, the roasted peppers, 2 tablespoons of the parsley, the vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste and cook the soup for 1 minute. Discard the bay leaf, divide the soup between 2 bowls, and garnish it with the remaining 1 tablespoon parsley.

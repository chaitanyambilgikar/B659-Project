Preheat broiler.
Bring radishes, water, butter, and 1/8 teaspoon each of salt and pepper to a boil in a 10-inch skillet. Cover, then reduce heat and gently simmer, stirring occasionally, until radishes are tender and most of liquid has evaporated, 10 to 12 minutes. Whisk in mustard. Add radish leaves and cook, tossing, just until wilted. Remove from heat and stir in half of tarragon.
Meanwhile, coat steak with oil, garlic, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper. Broil on a broiler pan 4 to 5 inches from heat, turning once, 5 to 6 minutes for medium-rare. Let rest on a cutting board 2 to 3 minutes, then slice across the grain.
Serve steak over radishes and greens and sprinkle with remaining tarragon.

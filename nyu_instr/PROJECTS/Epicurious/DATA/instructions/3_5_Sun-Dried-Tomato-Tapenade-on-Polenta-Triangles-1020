For Tapenade: Combine all ingredients in processor. Using on/of turns, process until finely chopped. Transfer to small bowl. Season with salt and pepper.
For Polenta: Combine whipping cream, water and salt in heavy medium saucepan. Bring to boil. Gradually whisk in cornmeal. Reduce heat to medium-low and stir until polenta is thick, about 10 minutes. Mix in hot sauce. Season with pepper. Pour into 8-inch square glass baking dish. Chill until cold, about 1 hour. (Tapenade and polenta can be made 1 day ahead. Cover separately and chill.)
Cut polenta into 12 squares. Cut each square in half diagonally, forming 24 triangles. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large nonstick skillet over high heat. Working in batches, add polenta triangles and sauté until golden, adding remaining 2 tablespoons oil as necessary, about 2 minutes per side for each batch. Transfer polenta to paper towels; drain.
Divide tapenade among triangles. Arrange on platter. Garnish with parsley. Serve at room temperature.

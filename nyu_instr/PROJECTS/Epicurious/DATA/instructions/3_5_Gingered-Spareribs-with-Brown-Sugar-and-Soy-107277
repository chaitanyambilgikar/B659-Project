Heat vegetable oil in large wide shallow pot over medium-high heat. Working in batches, add ribs and brown on all sides, about 8 minutes. Transfer ribs to large bowl. Add garlic and ginger to pot; sauté 30 seconds. Add brown sugar, vinegar, and soy sauce. Stir to blend. Return ribs to pot. Cover pot and simmer over medium-low heat until meat is tender, turning ribs occasionally, about 45 minutes. If sauce is thin, gradually add cornstarch mixture to ribs and simmer until sauce thickens slightly, about 2 minutes. Serve ribs over rice.

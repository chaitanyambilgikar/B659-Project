Cut potatoes into 1 1/2-inch pieces and cover with cold water in a large pot. Add 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and simmer over medium heat, partially covered, until just tender, 12 to 15 minutes.
While potatoes cook, whisk together vinegar, mustard, sugar, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a large bowl until sugar and salt are dissolved. Add oil in a slow stream, whisking until combined.
Drain potatoes well and, while still hot, stir into dressing to coat, then stir in mackerel, scallions, and dill. Serve warm or at room temperature.

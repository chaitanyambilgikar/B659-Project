Brush a large baking sheet with some of the butter, arrange the muffin slices in one layer, touching, on the sheet, and brush them with the remaining butter. Bake the muffin slices in the upper third of a preheated 375°F. oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until they are pale golden. In a small bowl combine well the aniseed, the cinnamon, the allspice, the sugar, and the salt, sprinkle the mixture over the toasts, and bake the toasts for 4 minutes more, or until they are crisp and golden brown.

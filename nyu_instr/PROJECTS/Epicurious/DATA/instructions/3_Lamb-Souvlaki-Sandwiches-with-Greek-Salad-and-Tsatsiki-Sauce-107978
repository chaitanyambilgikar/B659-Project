Make tsatsiki sauce: Purée cucumber, yogurt, lemon juice, garlic, salt, and pepper in a blender until almost smooth, about 1 minute. Stir in mint and chill, covered, until serving.
Make lamb sandwiches: Preheat broiler.
Wrap pitas in foil and put in lower third of oven to warm while broiling lamb.
Put lamb on oiled rack of a broiler pan and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Broil lamb 5 to 6 inches from heat, turning over once, 12 to 14 minutes total for medium-rare. Transfer to a cutting board and let stand 5 minutes, then thinly slice.
While lamb is standing, toss together salad ingredients in a bowl and season with salt and pepper.
Stuff warm pita pockets with salad and lamb, then drizzle filling with tsatsiki sauce.

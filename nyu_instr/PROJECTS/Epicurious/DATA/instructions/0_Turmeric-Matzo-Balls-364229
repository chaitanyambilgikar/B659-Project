In a medium bowl whisk the eggs and the oil.
Add the turmeric into the egg mixture. Whisk to incorporate to an even yellow color.
Sprinkle in 1/2 cup (1 bag) of the matzo ball mix. Stir in with a fork, mixing as little as possible. Don't overwork it. Chill in refrigerator for 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, bring a pot of water or chicken stock to a boil.
Wet your hands in a bowl of cold water. Using your hand, and manipulating as little as possible, scoop out a ping-pong-ball size of the mixture, adding more matzo ball mix or matzo meal as needed. Form into a ball with your fingertips, using no real pressure. Bring the water down to a simmer. Drop the balls into the water. Cover the pot and simmer for 20 minutes.

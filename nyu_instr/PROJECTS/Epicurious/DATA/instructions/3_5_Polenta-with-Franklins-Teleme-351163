Stir together water, polenta, and sea salt in a heavy medium saucepan, then bring to a boil, covered. Simmer, uncovered, stirring constantly with a long-handled wooden spoon, until smooth and creamy, about 20 minutes. If mixture starts to tighten and get dry, add more water (up to 1/2 cup).
Remove from heat and stir in butter. Pull cheese into pieces and stir into polenta until incorporated. Season with sea salt and pepper.

Combine the liquids in a large pot or skillet. Add 2 tarragon stems (leaves reserved), bay leaves, peppercorns, and carrot. Bring to a boil. Cook until flavorful, 15 to 20 minutes. Reduce to a simmer and add the salmon filets. Simmer, covered, for 10 to 12 minutes. Turn off the heat and allow the salmon to cool in the bouillon. When completely cold, remove the salmon from the bouillon. Drain on paper towels to dry completely. Cover the fish with plastic wrap, and place in refrigerator to chill for 1 to 2 hours, or until ready to serve.
Meanwhile, place the mustard in a small bowl. In a slow, steady stream whisk in the olive oil. Stir in the reserved chopped tarragon. Taste and adjust for seasoning.
When ready to serve, place greens in a bowl. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Toss to combine. Arrange greens on 4 plates. Top each with a piece of salmon. Spoon mustard sauce over fish to coat. Garnish with sprigs of tarragon. Serve, passing remaining mustard sauce separately.

Fill a 6-quart pasta pot three fourths full with salted water and bring to a boil for pasta.
Trim vegetables and cut into 1 1/2 x 1/4-inch sticks. In a deep 12-inch heavy skillet melt butter over moderate heat and cook vegetables with salt and pepper to taste, stirring gently, 2 minutes. Add rosemary and cook, stirring gently, until vegetables are just tender, about 2 minutes more. Remove skillet from heat.
Cook pasta in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until al dente and ladle out and reserve 1 cup pasta water. Drain pasta in a colander and add to sauce with 1/4 cup reserved pasta water and salt and pepper to taste. Heat mixture over low heat, gently tossing (and adding more pasta water as needed if mixture becomes dry), until just heated through.
Serve pasta with Parmigiano-Reggiano.

Make crab mixture: In a small non-stick skillet sauté bell pepper in oil over moderately high heat, stirring, 2 minutes, or until softened and golden. In a bowl whisk together mayonnaise, yolk, mustard, lemon juice, tarragon, and bell pepper and stir in crab and salt and pepper to taste gently but thoroughly. Chill crab mixture, covered, at least 1 hour and up to 1 day.
Preheat oven to 350°F.
In a large shallow baking pan spread lt;I>panko in even layer. Toast panko, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 10 minutes, and cool.(Panko may be toasted 1 week ahead and kept in an airtight container at room temperature.)
Form rounded teaspoons of crab mixture into slightly flattened 1-inch rounds and gently coat with panko, transferring to a shallow baking pan. Chill crab cakes, loosely covered with wax paper, at least 2 hours and up to 4.
Make mustard mayonnaise: In a small bowl whisk together mayonnaise, mustard, and lemon juice. (Mayonnaise may be made 3 days ahead and chilled, covered.)
Preheat oven to 450°F.
Drizzle a scant 1/4 teaspoon butter on each crab cake and bake in middle of oven until crisp and cooked through, about 15 minutes.
Serve crab cakes with mustard mayonnaise.

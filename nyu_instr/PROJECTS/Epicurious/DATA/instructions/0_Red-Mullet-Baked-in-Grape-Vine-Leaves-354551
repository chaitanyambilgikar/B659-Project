Rinse the fish under cold running water and pat dry with paper towels. Season with salt and pepper, brush with a little oil, and chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C/Gas Mark 4) and brush an ovenproof dish with oil. Combine the garlic and parsley in a bowl, season with salt and pepper, and divide the mixture among the cavities of the fish. Wrap each fish in 1 or 2 grape leaves, depending on its size, leaving the heads and tails uncovered. Put the fish into the prepared dish, pour the oil and lemon juice over them, and place a slice of lemon on each. Bake for about 20 minutes, or until the fish flakes easily, and serve immediately.

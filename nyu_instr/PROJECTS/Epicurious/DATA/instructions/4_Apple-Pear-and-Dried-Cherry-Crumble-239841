Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter 13x9x2-inch oval ceramic baking dish. Mix 1 cup sugar, 3 tablespoons flour, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, and nutmeg in large bowl. Add apples, pears, and dried cherries to bowl; sprinkle with lemon juice and toss to coat. Transfer to prepared dish.
Using fingertips, mix butter, brown sugar, lemon peel, remaining 1 1/2 cups flour, and remaining 1 teaspoon cinnamon in medium bowl until moist clumps form. Crumble butter mixture over fruit.
Bake until fruit bubbles at edges and crumble is crisp and beginning to brown on top, about 1 hour. Cool about 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, beat cream in medium bowl until peaks form. Gradually whisk in maple syrup.
Spoon crumble into bowls and serve with vanilla ice cream and maple cream.

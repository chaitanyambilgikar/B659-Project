Blend goat cheese, oil and yogurt in processor until smooth. Transfer to small bowl. Mix in all herbs and flowers, if desired. Season dip to taste with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate until dip is cold and flavors blend, about 3 hours. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Keep chilled.)
Serve dip with toasted baguette slices and raw vegetables.

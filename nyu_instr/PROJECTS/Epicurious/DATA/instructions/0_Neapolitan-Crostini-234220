Cut the tomatoes in half through the core and squeeze gently to extract the seeds and juice. Trim away the core. Chop the tomatoes into half inch pieces and toss them in a bowl with the oregano, salt and pepper. Preheat the oven to 450°. Oil a large roasting pan. Arrange the bread slices on the pan. Toast the bread 5 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven, but leave it turned on. Place a slice of mozzarella on top of each piece of bread and then an anchovy. Spoon a little of the tomato on each. Drizzle with a few drops extra virgin olive oil. Return the pan to the oven and bake 5 to 7 minutes or until the cheese is melted.

Preheat oven to 450°F. Lightly oil 9-inch glass pie plate. Arrange shrimp in prepared plate. Season shrimp lightly with salt and pepper.
Heat oil in heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add garlic and green onions and sauté until softened, about 2 minutes. Add spinach to skillet. Cover and cook until spinach is tender and wilted, stirring occasionally, about 4 minutes. Mix in basil, cheese, hot pepper sauce and vinegar. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat; mix in Pernod. Spoon spinach mixture evenly over shrimp.
Bake until shrimp are just cooked through, approximately 8 minutes.

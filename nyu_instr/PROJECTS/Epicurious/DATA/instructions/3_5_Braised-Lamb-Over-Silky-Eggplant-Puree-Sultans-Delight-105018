Braise lamb: Pat one third of lamb dry and season with salt and pepper. Heat 1/2 tablespoon butter in a 4-quart heavy pot over moderately high heat until foam subsides, then brown seasoned lamb, turning occasionally, about 6 minutes. Transfer to a plate and brown remaining lamb in same manner in 2 batches, adding more butter if necessary.
When third batch of lamb is browned, return rest of lamb with any juices to pot and add tomato, water, and salt. Cook at a bare simmer, covered, stirring occasionally, until meat is very tender, 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Season with salt and pepper.
Make eggplant purée while lamb Prepare grill for cooking.
Fill a large bowl with cold water and add lemon juice.
Prick eggplant in several places with a skewer or toothpick (to prevent bursting). Grill eggplant, turning occasionally, until charred all over and tender inside, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and cool slightly (eggplant will collapse), then peel with a sharp small knife while still warm, leaving stem intact. (This makes the eggplant easier to handle—it may fall apart otherwise.)
Soak eggplant in lemon water 15 minutes, then transfer to a colander. Discard stem and drain eggplant flesh 45 minutes.
Melt butter in a 9- to 10-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat, then whisk in flour and cook, stirring constantly, until roux just begins to brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Add milk in a stream, whisking, and bring to a boil, whisking. Reduce heat and simmer, whisking occasionally, until thick, about 3 minutes.
Add drained eggplant and stir, mashing with a fork, until incorporated. Stir in cheese and salt and season with pepper.
Serve eggplant topped with braised lamb.

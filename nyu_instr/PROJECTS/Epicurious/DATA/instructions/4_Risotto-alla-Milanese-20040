Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a heavy skillet. When it is bubbling, add the onion. Cook for 2-3 minutes; do not allow the onion to brown. Add the rice and stir it well with a spatula; do not allow it to color. Be certain that the onion and rice are well coated with the butter. Add the wine and let it almost cook away. Start to add stock, a cup at a time. Let each cup of stock cook away before adding more. As the rice becomes tender, stir it with a fork to keep it from sticking to the pan. Add salt and a touch of saffron. When the rice is done, stir in the remaining 2-3 tablespoons of butter and a little grated Parmesan cheese. Serve at once. This is usually offered as a first course in Italy but may be served with certain meats, if you wish, or as a main course at luncheon.
Variations Before adding the wine, add 4-5 slices poached marrow.
Add a little dry sherry, about 1/3 cup, to the risotto when you add the stock. If you are serving the risotto with a veal or chicken dish, use hot tomato juice instead of stock and add a little chopped basil.
Garnish the cooked risotto with thinly sliced white truffles.

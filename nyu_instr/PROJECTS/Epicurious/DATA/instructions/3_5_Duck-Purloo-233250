Put duck breasts, skin sides up, in a 6 to 8-quart heavy pot and add broth. Bring just to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, until very tender when pierced with a fork, 2 to 3 hours. Transfer duck to a bowl with a slotted spoon, then, when cool enough to handle, remove and discard skin and shred meat with 2 forks. Skim off and discard fat from broth and return shredded duck to pot.
While duck cooks, crumble breakfast sausage into a deep 12-inch heavy skillet and cook over moderately high heat, stirring occasionally, until browned, about 5 minutes. Add kielbasa, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Skim off all but about 2 tablespoons fat and discard it.
Add onions and bell peppers to sausage mixture and increase heat to high, then cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are softened, about 10 minutes. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring, until softened, about 3 minutes. Transfer sausage mixture to a large bowl. Cool to room temperature, then chill, covered, until duck is finished cooking.
Return sausage mixture to pot with duck meat and add remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper, habanero chile, and salt. Stir in rice and bring liquid to a rolling boil over high heat, then reduce heat and simmer, covered, stirring occasionally, until rice is tender and moist but not soggy, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, 15 minutes. Stir in parsley and season with salt and pepper.

Preheat oven to 350°F.
Bring milk, cream, cardamom, peppercorns, fennel seeds, cinnamon sticks, and cloves to a boil in a heavy saucepan over moderate heat. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, cook granulated sugar in a dry small heavy saucepan over moderate heat, swirling pan (to help sugar melt evenly), until sugar is melted into a deep golden caramel. Immediately pour caramel into ramekins, tilting to cover bottoms evenly.
Whisk together whole egg and yolk in a large bowl. Bring spiced milk to a boil again, then add to eggs in a slow stream, whisking. Pour custard base through a fine sieve into a 2-cup measure. Add brown sugar and a pinch of salt, then stir until sugar is dissolved. Divide custard between ramekins.
Bake custards in a water bath in middle of oven until set but still trembling slightly, about 30 minutes. (Custards will continue to set as they cool.) Remove ramekins from water and cool crème caramels on a rack. Chill, loosely covered with plastic wrap, until cold, at least 3 hours.
Just before serving, run a knife around inside edges of ramekins. Arrange raspberries, open ends up, over entire surface of custards, pressing gently to adhere. Place a pistachio phyllo crisp over each ramekin and invert onto a plate, then carefully remove ramekins.

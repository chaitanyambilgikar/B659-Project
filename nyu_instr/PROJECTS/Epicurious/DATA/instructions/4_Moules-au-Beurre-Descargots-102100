Preheat the broiler or preheat the oven to 475°F.
Place the garlic and parsley in a food processor and process until finely chopped. Add the butter, olive oil, Pernod, salt, and pepper and pulse until smooth. Scrape the mixture into a bowl.
Place the mussels in a large roasting pan and distribute dollops of the butter around the pan. Cover tightly and place in the oven for 10 minutes, or until the mussels have opened.
Divide the contents of the roasting pan among four soup or pasta bowls, discarding any mussels that have not opened. Serve immediately.

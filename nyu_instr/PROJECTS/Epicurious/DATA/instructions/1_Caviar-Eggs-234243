1. To remove top of egg: Cup egg, point side up, in palm of hand. Place small spice bottle upside down on top of egg, holding egg and bottle stable between thumb and forefinger. With other hand, hold heavy wooden spoon above bottle and strike downward, hitting bottle and creating crack around top of egg. Remove bottle and insert sharp paring knife into crack. Cut around horizontally to form small opening in top of egg.
2. Pour out egg into large mixing bowl; reserve. Set aside eggshell — both bottom and cut-off top. Repeat with remaining eggs. Under hot running water, rinse eggshell bottoms and tops. Set each top and bottom next to each other upside down on paper towels to dry. When dry, arrange bottoms in egg cups with tops on the side. Place toasted side down and toast again, being careful not to burn the toast. Arrange around base of each egg cup.
3. Whisk reserved eggs, then strain through fine sieve into another mixing bowl. Season with white pepper.
4. In saucepan over low heat, or in a double boiler, cook eggs, whisking constantly, until they start to thicken, about 5 minutes. Whisk in cream and shallots. Cook, whisking constantly, 30 seconds more or until desired consistency. Immediately transfer to glass bowl to stop eggs from further cooking and add the chives.
5. Carefully divide egg mixture among eggshell bottoms, filling each two thirds full. Top each with chives and caviar. Partially cover each egg with eggshell top, and serve immediately.

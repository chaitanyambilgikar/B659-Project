For sauce: Mix first 7 ingredients in medium bowl to blend well. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover; chill.) Mix in remaining ingredients. Season orange-sesame sauce with salt and pepper.
For scallops: Heat peanut oil and sesame oil in heavy large skillet over high heat. Sprinkle scallops with salt and pepper. Add to skillet; sauté until just opaque in center, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to large bowl. Add mint and cilantro; toss to coat. Thread 1 scallop onto each skewer. Arrange skewers decoratively on platter. Serve with sauce.
* Chili-garlic sauce is available at Asian markets and in the Asian foods section of many supermarkets.

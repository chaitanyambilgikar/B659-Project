1. Heat the oil in a large skillet or sauté pan set over medium heat. Add the cauliflower and onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until the florets are lightly browned, about 7 minutes. Stir in the curry powder and continue cooking until fragrant, about 1 minute.
2. Add the thinned yogurt, cover the pan, and reduce the heat to medium-low. Simmer until the florets are tender but still hold their shape, about 6 minutes. Stir in the cilantro and season with salt and pepper to taste. If necessary, simmer, uncovered, to evaporate any remaining liquid in the pan. Serve immediately.

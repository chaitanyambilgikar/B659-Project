1. Preheat oven to 400°F.
2. In a saucepan over medium heat, combine the corn, salt, and 1/2 cup water. Whisk in the cornmeal and cook, stirring constantly, until the liquid is absorbed, about 5 minutes.
3. Add the butter and cheese, stirring to combine. Remove from heat.
4. Grease a 6-cup muffin tin. Divide the corn mixture evenly among the cups, pressing it into the bottom and up the sides to create cups.
5. Bake until crisp, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes, then turn the corn cups out of the tin.
6. Stuff them with the fillings of your choice and serve.

Stir together chile paste and 2 tablespoons water in a small cup.
Heat oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then sauté shallots, stirring, until edges are starting to brown, about 2 minutes. Add snap peas and salt and stir-fry 2 minutes. Add chile paste mixture and stir-fry until snap peas are just tender and beginning to brown in spots, about 3 minutes.
Stir in remaining tablespoon water, scraping up any brown bits from bottom of skillet.
Transfer snap peas to a bowl and stir in lime juice and mint. Serve immediately.

Blend first 4 ingredients in medium bowl. Mix in crabmeat, shrimp and 1/2 cup breadcrumbs. Season with pepper. Place remaining 1 cup breadcrumbs on plate. Drop 1/4 of crab mixture into breadcrumbs; turn to coat. Shape into 2 1/2-inch-diameter cake. Repeat coating and shaping with remaining crab mixture and crumbs, forming total of 4 cakes.
Heat oil in heavy medium skillet over medium heat. Add cakes and sauté until crisp, about 5 minutes per side.

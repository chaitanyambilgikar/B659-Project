Sift together flour, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl.
Cut butter into bits and, with your fingertips or a pastry blender, blend into flour mixture until it resembles coarse meal.
Using a fork, stir raisins and milk until just combined.
Transfer to a lightly floured surface and, with floured hands, knead until it forms a dough.
Roll out dough into a 9-inch round (about 1/2 inch thick) and cut out scones with a 2 1/2-inch round cutter.
Arrange scones 1 inch apart on a buttered large baking sheet and gently reroll and cut out scraps.
Bake scones in middle of a 425°F oven until pale golden, about 15 minutes, and transfer to a rack to cool.

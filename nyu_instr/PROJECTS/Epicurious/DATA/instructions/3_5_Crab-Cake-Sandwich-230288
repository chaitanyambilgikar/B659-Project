Remove shells and cartilage from crabmeat. Add egg whites and mix lightly with a fork. Add mayonnaise, Old Bay, Worcestershire, pepper, parsley, mustard, and breadcrumbs. Mix gently, leaving crab lumps as large as possible. Using hands, form 6 patties. Add oil to a nonstick skillet; fry patties until golden brown on each side, about 10 minutes total. Serve on roll with cocktail sauce or lowfat tartar sauce (2 parts light mayo to 1 part pickle relish).

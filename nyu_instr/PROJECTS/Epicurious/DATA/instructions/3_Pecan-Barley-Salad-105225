Bring barley, water, and salt to a boil in a 2-quart heavy saucepan, then reduce heat and simmer, covered, until barley is tender, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, 5 minutes. Drain barley in a colander, then rinse under cold water and drain well.
While barley is simmering, cook pecans in oil in a heavy skillet over moderately low heat, stirring frequently, until nuts are toasted 1 shade darker, about 4 minutes.
Toss nuts and oil with barley and remaining ingredients in a large bowl, then season with salt and pepper.

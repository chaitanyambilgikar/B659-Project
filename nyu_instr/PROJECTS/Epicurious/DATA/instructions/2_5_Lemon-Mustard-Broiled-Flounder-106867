1. Place the butter in a small bowl and combine with the mustard, parsley, and lemon zest. Set aside.
2. Arrange the oven or broiler rack 4 inches from the heat. Preheat the broiler. Line 2 baking sheets with aluminum foil. Oil the foil lightly. Evenly space 4 flounder fillets on each of the baking sheets.
3. Spread about 1 1/2 teaspoons of the butter mixture atop each fish fillet. Broil for 4 to 5 minutes, or until the fish is lightly browned on top and just cooked through. Do not overcook.
4. Serve immediately, garnished with a flourish of clover sprouts and a lemon quarter.

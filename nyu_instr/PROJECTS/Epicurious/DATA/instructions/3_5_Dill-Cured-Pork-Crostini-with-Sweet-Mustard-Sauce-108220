Pat all of salt mixture over pork, coating generously. Sprinkle with 3/4 cup dill, patting to adhere. Wrap pork with plastic. Place in baking dish. Chill 6 hours.

Roast until meat thermometer registers 150°F when inserted into center of pork, turning after 15 minutes, about 25 minutes total. Cool pork completely. Cover and chill until cold, at least 6 hours.

Heat about 1 1/2 inches oil in a wok or 4- to 5-quart heavy pot over high heat until a tiny piece of pappadam dropped in oil quickly bobs to surface and expands (about 350°F).
Reduce heat to medium-high. Slip 1 pappadam into oil and let it expand to its full size and turn light brown, 10 to 30 seconds. Using tongs, flip it over quickly and fry other side until light brown. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Repeat with remaining pappadams. (If pappadams don't expand immediately, oil is too cool; if they brown too quickly, oil is too hot.)

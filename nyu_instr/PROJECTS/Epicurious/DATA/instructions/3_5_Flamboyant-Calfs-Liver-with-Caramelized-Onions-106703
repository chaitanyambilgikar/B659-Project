1. Cook bacon in a large skillet over medium heat until crisp but not burned. Using a slotted spoon, remove bacon to paper towels to drain. Set aside, covered with foil to keep warm.
2. In the same skillet, cook the onions over medium heat until wilted and golden, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon to a bowl, cover and keep warm.
3. Cook the liver, 2 slices at a time, for about 1 1/2 minutes per side for medium-rare, adding butter to the skillet if needed. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
4. Cut each liver slice on the diagonal into 6 pieces. Arrange on a serving platter and cover loosely with foil.
5. Add vinegar and broth to the skillet; bring to a boil, scraping up any brown bits. Add the reserved onions and toss over medium heat for 1 minute to warm through; spoon over the liver and top with bacon. Sprinkle with chopped parsley and serve immediately.

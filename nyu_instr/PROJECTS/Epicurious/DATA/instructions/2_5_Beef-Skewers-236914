Soak skewers in water for 1/2 hour.
Preheat the broiler.
In a small sauté pan over low heat, toast the sesame seeds, stirring constantly to avoid burning them. When the seeds are golden, remove them from the pan and reserve.
Slice the beef into very thin strips — 1 1/2 inches in length, 3/4 inch in width, and as close to 1/4 inches thick as you can get.
Slice the white stems of the green onions into 3/4-inch-long pieces; discard the rest.
Roll up one piece of beef like a jellyroll. Place it on a skewer, add one piece of green onion, then another piece of beef and another scallion. Repeat with all the skewers. Sprinkle the skewers with salt.
To cook: Place under the broiler for 2 to 3 minutes for medium rare. Sprinkle with sesame seeds and serve.

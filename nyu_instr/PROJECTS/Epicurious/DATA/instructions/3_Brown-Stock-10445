Spread the bones and the beef in a flameproof roasting pan and roast them in pre-heated 400°F. oven for 25 minutes. Add the onions and the carrots, roast the mixture, stirring once or twice, for 30 minutes more, or until it is browned well, and transfer it with a slotted spoon to a stockpot or kettle. Pour off any fat from the pan, add 2 cups water, and deglaze the pan over high heat, scraping up the brown bits. Add the liquid to the pot with 14 cups cold water and bring the liquid to a boil, skimming the froth. Add 1/2 cup cold water and bring the mixture to a simmer, skimming the froth. Add the celery, the garlic, the parsley, the salt, the thyme, and the bay leaf and simmer the mixture for 4 hours. If a more concentrated flavor is desired, boil the stock until it is reduced to the desired concentration. Strain the stock through a fine sieve into a bowl and let it cool to warm. Chill the stock and remove the fat. The stock keeps, covered and chilled, for 1 week if it is brought to a boil every 2 days and then allowed to cool to warm, uncovered, before being chilled again, and keeps, frozen, for 3 months.

In a small heavy saucepan combine sugar, corn syrup, butter, and a pinch of salt and cook over moderate heat, stirring, until sugar is dissolved. Boil syrup, without stirring, until it registers 280°F. on a candy thermometer, about 5 minutes. Remove pan from heat and stir in cream, vanilla, and lemon juice, stirring until smooth. Sauce will thicken as it cools. Sauce keeps, covered and chilled, 3 weeks. Serve sauce warm or at room temperature over ice cream.

Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender, stirring occasionally. Drain, reserving 1 cup cooking liquid. Return pasta to pot. Add 1/4 cup reserved cooking liquid, cheese, and butter. Toss over medium heat until cheese melts and sauce coats pasta, adding more reserved cooking liquid if dry, about 3 minutes. Season generously with salt and pepper. Transfer to serving bowl. Garnish with Parmesan shavings, if desired, and serve.

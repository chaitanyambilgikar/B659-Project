Season chicken with salt and pepper. Place flour in plastic bag. Add chicken pieces and toss to coat completely.
Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken pieces to skillet and sauté until brown, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to plate. Pour fat from skillet. Add remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil to skillet. Add halved mushrooms, diced green bell peppers, chopped onion, chopped garlic and oregano and sauté until onion is tender, about 10 minutes. Mix in marinara sauce, chicken broth, Marsala and capers. Return chicken pieces to skillet, spooning sauce over. Bring sauce to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low. Cover skillet and simmer until chicken is tender, about 20 minutes.
Using tongs, transfer chicken to large platter. Boil sauce until slightly thickened, about 3 minutes; spoon off fat. Spoon sauce over chicken. Serve, passing Parmesan separately, if desired.

Cut four 1/2-inch-thick slices from middle of loaf and brush both sides of each slice with some oil. Cut enough 1/4-inch-thick slices from feta to cover 2 slices of bread and cut tomato into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Assemble 2 sandwiches with feta and tomato slices, seasoning filling with oregano, pepper, and salt.
In a 12-inch nonstick skillet heat 1 tablespoon oil over moderate heat until hot but not smoking and cook sandwiches until golden, about 2 minutes on each side.

In a kettle bring 6 cups water with the crab boil to a boil, simmer the mixture for 5 minutes, and add the shrimp. Boil the shrimp for 5 minutes and drain them. In a small bowl whisk together the vinegar, the celery seeds, the salt, and pepper to taste, add the oil in a stream, whisking, and whisk the dressing until it is emulsified. In a deep glass dish arrange half the shrimp in one layer, arrange half the onion slices over them, and top them with the bay leaves. Arrange the remaining shrimp over the onions, sprinkle the remaining onion slices over them, and pour the dressing over the mixture. Let the shrimp marinate, covered and chilled, for 24 hours and serve them skewered on wooden picks or with the crackers.

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat) or preheat broiler. Whisk dressing and mustard in small bowl to blend. Reserve 1/3 cup dressing mixture for salad. Brush chicken with remaining mixture; season with salt and pepper. Grill or broil chicken until cooked through, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to plate. Grill or broil bread until lightly toasted, about 1 minute per side. Tranfer toasts to work surface; top each toast with 1 anchovy.
Toss lettuce in medium bowl with reserved 1/3 cup dressing mixture; divide salad between 2 plates. Cut chicken crosswise into thin slices; arrange over lettuce. Sprinkle salads with cheese. Garnish with anchovy toasts and serve.

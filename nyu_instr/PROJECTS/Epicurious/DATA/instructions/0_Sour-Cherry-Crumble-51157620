Almond Crumble Blend all of the ingredients together in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment until the mixture becomes crumbly. Refrigerate until ready to use.
Cherry Filling Preheat the oven to 325°F. In a large bowl, mix together all of the ingredients except the butter using a rubber spatula. Transfer the cherry mixture to a 10 by 7-inch baking dish. Dot the top of the mixture with the butter. Cover with the almond crumble and bake until golden brown and bubbly, 45 minutes to 1 hour.
Whipped Ricotta In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whip the ricotta with the lemon juice, vanilla, and salt until light and smooth. Serve alongside the warm crumble.

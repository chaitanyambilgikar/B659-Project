Soak sliced leeks in a large bowl of water, agitating them occasionally to dislodge any sand, then drain leeks and pat them dry.
Toss scallops with cumin seeds and salt and pepper to taste. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then sear scallops until golden, about 2 minutes on each side. Transfer to a bowl with tongs. Heat remaining tablespoon oil in skillet (do not clean) until hot but not smoking, then sauté cauliflower and leeks with salt to taste, stirring until golden. Add wine and water and simmer, covered, until vegetables are almost tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Add cream and scallops with juices in bowl and simmer, uncovered, until liquid is slightly thickened, about 3 minutes. Stir in cilantro and lemon juice and season with salt and pepper.

Spread the bread with the butter and with a 2-inch scalloped cutter cut it into 12 rounds. In a small bowl combine well the carrot, the lemon juice, the oil, and salt and pepper to taste, divide the mixture among the bread rounds, and on it arrange decoratively the mackerel and the scallion green.
The canapés may be made 30 minutes in advance and kept covered and chilled. Arrange the canapés on a platter.

In a shallow bowl stir together garlic paste, thyme, and 3 teaspoons lemon juice. Add chicken, turning to coat, and marinate, covered, 15 minutes. Pat chicken dry.
In a 9-inch heavy skillet heat oil and butter over moderately high heat until foam subsides and sauté chicken, skin side down, until golden, about 2 minutes on each side. Transfer chicken with tongs to a plate. Add flour to skillet and cook roux over moderately low heat, whisking, 3 minutes. Whisk in broth and remaining teaspoon lemon juice in a stream, whisking until gravy is smooth. Return chicken to skillet with any juices accumulated on plate and simmer, covered, 15 minutes, or until springy to the touch and just cooked through.
Stir in parsley and serve over rice.

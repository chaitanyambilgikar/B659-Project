Set strainer over large bowl. Line strainer with 4 layers of cheesecloth, allowing 4 inches to extend over sides of strainer (do not let strainer touch bottom of bowl). Spoon yogurt into strainer. Gather cheesecloth together; fold over yogurt. Refrigerate at least 8 hours or overnight (liquid will drain out and yogurt will thicken).
Combine sesame seeds, salt, summer savory, cayenne and cumin in small bowl. Open cheesecloth at top. Using rubber spatula, transfer drained yogurt to bowl. Drizzle olive oil over. Sprinkle with sesame seed mixture. Place bowl in center of platter; surround with pita bread triangles and olives.
Broil tomatoes until skins begin to split and blacken in spots, turning occasionally, about 4 minutes. Cool. Peel tomatoes. Cut into wedges. Arrange peppers, tomatoes and eggs on platter. Sprinkle with tuna and capers. Mix oil and lemon juice in small bowl. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Drizzle dressing over salad.

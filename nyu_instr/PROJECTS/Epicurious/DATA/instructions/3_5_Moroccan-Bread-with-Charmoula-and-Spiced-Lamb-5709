Make lamb: Stir all ingredients in bowl to blend. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Chill at least 2 hours and up to 1 day.
Make dough: Pour 1 cup warm water into large bowl; sprinkle yeast over. Let stand until mixture is foamy, about 10 minutes. Mix in 1/4 cup oil and salt. Combine both flours in medium bowl. Stir enough flour mixture into yeast mixture 1/2 cup at a time to form slightly sticky dough. Knead on floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Oil large bowl; add dough and turn to coat. Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Let stand in warm area until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons oil in medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add lamb mixture; sauté until just cooked through, about 3 minutes. Transfer to plate.
Make charmoula: Combine all ingredients in medium bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside.
Punch dough down. Divide into 4 equal pieces. Cover; let stand 10 minutes. Preheat oven to 450°F. Roll out each dough piece on floured surface to 7-inch square. Top each with 1/4 of charmoula, then 1/4 of lamb, pressing to adhere to dough. Oil 2 large baking sheets. Using large spatula, transfer breads to sheets.
Bake breads until cooked through and brown on bottom, about 15 minutes. Serve warm.

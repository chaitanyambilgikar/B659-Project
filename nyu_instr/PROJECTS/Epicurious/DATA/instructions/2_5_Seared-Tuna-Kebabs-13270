Prepare grill.
Cut fennel into 1-inch-thick wedges and halve crosswise into 1-inch pieces. In a medium saucepan of boiling salted water blanch fennel 2 1/2 minutes. In a colander drain fennel and refresh under cold water.
In a bowl stir together oil, garlic, gingerroot, lime juice, and thyme. Add fennel, cucumber, and tuna, tossing to coat, and let stand, covered, at room temperature 15 minutes.
Thread fennel, cucumber, and tuna onto two 10-inch metal skewers and grill kebabs on an oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals, turning them, until tuna is cooked through, about 12 minutes.

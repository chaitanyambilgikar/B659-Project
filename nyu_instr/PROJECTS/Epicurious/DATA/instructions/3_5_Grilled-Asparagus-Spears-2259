Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Combine water, olive oil and roasted garlic oil in large bowl. Add asparagus to water mixture and toss to coat. Let stand 5 minutes. Drain. Season with salt and pepper.
Grill asparagus until crisp-tender, turning frequently, about 6 minutes.
Transfer to platter. Sprinkle with parsley.

Bring broth to simmer in heavy small saucepan over medium-high heat. Add marrow; reduce heat to low and poach gently until marrow looks translucent and gray, about 2 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer marrow to small plate. Refrigerate marrow poaching liquid. Refrigerate marrow until cold and firm, about 45 minutes. Dice marrow finely; cover and chill. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Keep marrow and poaching liquid chilled.)
Melt 1 tablespoon butter in heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add shallot and sauté until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add wine and boil until reduced to scant 1/2 cup, about 5 minutes. Transfer reduction to small bowl.
Melt 2 tablespoons butter in heavy large skillet over high heat. Sprinkle steaks lightly with salt and pepper. Add to skillet and sear until cooked to desired doneness, about 3 minutes per side for medium-rare. Transfer steaks to plates. Add wine reduction to skillet and bring to boil, scraping up browned bits. Reduce heat to medium. Whisk in remaining 3 tablespoons butter, 1 tablespoon at a time. Add 1/4 cup reserved marrow poaching liquid and diced marrow. Cook until marrow melts and sauce is smooth, whisking constantly, about 2 minutes. Thin sauce with more poaching liquid by tablespoonfuls, if desired. Season sauce with salt and pepper. Spoon sauce over steaks. Sprinkle with parsley.

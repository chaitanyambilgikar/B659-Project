Set the fish, skin side down, in a plastic container or shallow baking dish large enough to hold it flat.
In a small bowl, combine the maple syrup, rum, and mustard. Rub the fish all over with the marinade. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, turning once or twice.
Set the oven at 450°F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
Set the salmon on the baking sheet skin side down.
Roast the salmon for 15 minutes, or until the fish flakes easily when tested with the tip of a knife. Remove from the oven and slide onto a platter to serve.

Generously season the steaks with salt and pepper. Press in the seasoning, and dab the meat onto the board to collect any excess.
Glisten the meat with canola oil, using the first steak to brush oil onto the others.
Preheat the BBQ to medium-high.
Combine the baste ingredients in a foil pan or heatproof pan and warm on the side of the grill.
Put the meat on the well-oiled grill and cook until medium-rare (or cook to desired doneness).
Baste regularly, stacking and/or flipping the meat if the flames get out of control.
When the steaks are nicely caramelized and charred on both sides, approximately 15 to 25 minutes total, they are done. (You can check the temp with an instant-read thermometer if that is more comfortable; the steaks should register 125°F).
Combine the board dressing ingredients.
Let the steaks rest for 2 minutes, then pour the board dressing onto a cutting board and slice the steaks, turning to coat the slices.
*When steaks come off the grill looking all charred and gorgeous, it'll be tough to resist digging in right away. But letting them rest is essential. Otherwise, a lot of the lovely, tasty juices will spill out when you slice in.

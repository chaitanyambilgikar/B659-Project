Lightly brush muffin cups with coconut oil. Set aside. Pulse nuts in a food processor until coarsely ground. Add 3 tablespoons agave syrup, flour, ginger, salt, and 2 teaspoons coconut oil. Process until coarse dough forms. Gather into a ball. Press 1 heaping tablespoon dough firmly onto bottom and up sides of each muffin cup. Chill for 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 350°F. Bake crusts until firm and golden around edges, 8-10 minutes. Let cool in pan on a wire rack for at least 10 minutes before removing. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Let cool completely; store airtight at room temperature.
Place strawberries, lemon juice, and remaining 2 tablespoons agave syrup in a medium bowl; scrape in vanilla seeds (save bean for another use). Stir well, crushing a few berries to release their juices.
Using a spatula or butter knife, remove tart shells from pan and fill with strawberry mixture. Serve immediately.

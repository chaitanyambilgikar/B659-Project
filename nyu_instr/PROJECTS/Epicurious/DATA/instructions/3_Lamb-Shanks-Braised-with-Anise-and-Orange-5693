Finely grind star anise in spice grinder or in mortar with pestle. Rub half of ground star anise over lamb shanks. Sprinkle lamb with salt and pepper. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Working in batches, add lamb to pot; brown on all sides, about 12 minutes per batch. Transfer lamb to bowl. Add 1 tablespoon oil to pot; add onions, celery, carrots and garlic and sauté until golden, about 10 minutes. Return lamb to pot. Add all stock, orange juice, peel and remaining star anise. Bring to boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer until lamb is tender, about 1 hour 45 minutes. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Rewarm over medium heat before continuing.)
Transfer lamb to large bowl. Cover with foil. Working in batches, transfer cooking liquid and vegetables to processor; puree until smooth. Return liquid to pot. Boil until liquid is reduced to 6 cups, about 20 minutes. Mix in honey. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Pour over lamb and serve.

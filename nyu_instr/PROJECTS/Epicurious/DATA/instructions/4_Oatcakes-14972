Preheat oven to 350° F. and butter 2 large baking sheets.
In a food processor pulse oats until finely chopped. Cut butter into bits. Add butter to oats with all remaining ingredients except milk and pulse until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add milk and pulse until mixture just forms a dough.
On a lightly floured surface halve dough and wrap 1 half in plastic wrap. Roll out remaining dough 1/8 inch thick (about a 14-inch round) and with a 3-inch fluted round cutter cut out about 18 oatcakes.
On baking sheets arrange oatcakes about 3/4 inch apart and bake in upper and lower thirds of oven, switching position of sheets halfway through baking, until pale golden, about 20 minutes. Transfer oatcakes to a rack to cool completely. Make more oatcakes with remaining dough in same manner. Oatcakes may be made 1 week ahead and kept in an airtight container at room temperature.

Heat oven to 400°F. In a bowl, whisk orange juice and zest, 4 teaspoons oil, vinegar, 1/2 teaspoon salt, mustard and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Gently stir in lentils, chopped mint and onion. Arrange fillets on a foil-lined baking sheet. Brush with remaining 1 teaspoon oil; season with remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Roast until fish is opaque and just cooked through, 10 minutes. Spoon lentil salad onto plates; top with fish. Garnish with orange slices and mint sprigs.

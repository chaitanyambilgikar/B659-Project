Into an 8-inch baking pan pour half the butter, making sure it covers the entire bottom, and in the pan layer the potatoes, cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices, in separate rows, overlapping the slices. Sprinkle the potatoes with the salt, the rosemary, and pepper to taste, pour the remaining butter over them, and bake the potatoes in the middle of a preheated 425°F. oven, turning each row once with a long spatula, for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until they are crisp and golden. Sprinkle the potatoes with the additional salt.

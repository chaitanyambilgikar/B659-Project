In a small bowl stir together chili powder, garlic paste, cumin, and sugar and stir in Worcestershire sauce to make a paste.
Arrange steaks on a plate large enough to hold them in one layer and rub both sides of steaks with chili paste. Transfer steaks to a large sealable plastic bag. Marinate steaks, chilled, at least 4 hours and up to 2 days.
Prepare grill.
Grill steaks on an oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals 5 minutes on each side for medium-rare. (Alternatively, steaks may be grilled in a hot well-seasoned large ridged grill pan over moderately high heat.) Transfer steaks to plates and let stand 5 minutes.

Soak shrimp in warm water to cover in a bowl 5 minutes, then drain in a sieve, discarding water. Bring stock and shrimp to a boil in a 3-quart saucepan, then reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, 10 minutes. Stir in mint and immediately remove from heat. Add eggs in a slow stream, stirring slowly in one direction, then stir in salt and pepper.

Boil wine, shallots and 1 tablespoon mustard seeds in heavy small saucepan until mixture is reduced to 1/2 cup, about 2 minutes. Whisk in cream, 2 1/2 tablespoons Dijon mustard and tarragon. Boil until thickened to sauce consistency, abut 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat; cover.
Brush salmon on both sides with remaining 2 1/2 tablespoons Dijon mustard. Sprinkle remaining 2 tablespoons mustard seeds, salt and pepper onto both sides of salmon. Melt butter in large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add salmon and cook just until opaque in center, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer to platter. Spoon mustard sauce over salmon.

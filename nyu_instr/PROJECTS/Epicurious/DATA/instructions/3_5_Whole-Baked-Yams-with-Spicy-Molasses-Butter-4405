Using electric mixer, beat first 7 ingredients in medium bowl until fluffy. (Can be prepared 1 week ahead. Cover and chill. Bring to room temperature before using.)
Preheat oven to 350°F. Line large baking sheet with heavy-duty foil. Using small, sharp knife, make one 1/2-inch-deep lengthwise slit in each yam, leaving 1 inch of yam uncut at each end. Place yams on baking sheet. Bake yams until tender, about 1 hour 15 minutes.
Cut slits across center of each yam. Press ends toward center to expose flesh. Transfer yams to platter. Spoon 1 tablespoon spiced butter into each. Pass remaining spiced butter separately.

Combine ginger, soy sauce, honey, oil, garlic, vinegar, 1/2 tbsp water, and a pinch of salt and pepper in a blender. Mix 1/2 cup of this sauce with turkey, apple, and breadcrumbs; pour another 1/2 cup into a shallow pan to use as a marinade; reserve and refrigerate the rest for basting. (Note: To avoid food poisoning, don't use any of the marinade the turkey is sitting in for basting.) Wrap about 2 oz (or 1/4 cup) turkey mixture around each skewer (or roll mixture into a hot dog shape and spear with a skewer), so meat covers about 6 inches of each skewer. Place skewers in a shallow pan with marinade, cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours, preferably overnight. Grill skewers outdoors or on an indoor grill pan, basting occasionally, until juices run clear when pricked with a fork. Serve immediately.

Cook orecchiette in large pot of boiling salted water until pasta is tender but still firm to bite. Drain pasta, reserving 1 cup cooking liquid.
Meanwhile, melt butter with olive oil in another large pot over high heat. Add garlic and stir 30 seconds. Add garbanzo beans and sauté until garbanzo beans are beginning to color, about 8 minutes. Add half of sliced fresh sage and sauté 1 minute to blend flavors.
Add broccoli rabe, wine, and 1/2 cup reserved cooking liquid to pot. Cover and simmer until broccoli rabe is crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Uncover and add pasta, remaining sage, and Parmesan cheese; toss to combine. Mix in more of reserved cooking liquid by tablespoonfuls if pasta is dry. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer to large bowl and serve.

In a large heavy skillet (measuring at least 12 inches across top) cook garlic in oil over moderate heat, stirring, until pale golden. Add anchovies and cook, mashing them, until they dissolve into oil, about 1 minute. Stir in olives and parsley and remove skillet from heat.
In a kettle of salted boiling water cook spaghetti until al dente. Reserve 1 cup pasta cooking liquid and drain spaghetti in a colander. Add spaghetti and 1/2 cup reserved liquid to sauce. Heat pasta over moderate heat, stirring and tossing it and adding more reserved liquid as necessary, until it is coated well with sauce.

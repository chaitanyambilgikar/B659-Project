Char chiles over gas flame or in broiler until blackened on all sides. Enclose in paper bag 15 minutes. Peel and seed chiles, then cut lengthwise into 1/4-inch-wide strips.
Preheat oven to 350°F. Generously butter 13x9x2-inch glass baking dish. Combine 1 1/2 cups corn, eggs, and next 3 ingredients in blender. Blend until almost smooth. Transfer mixture to large bowl. Add sour cream and Maseca; stir until blended, then stir in ham, cheese, chiles, and remaining 1/2 cup corn. Transfer mixture to prepared baking dish. Bake until corn pudding is puffed and golden brown in spots on top, about 40 minutes.
*These fresh green chiles, often called pasillas, are available at some supermarkets and at specialty foods stores and Latin markets.
**Maseca (instant corn masa mix) is available at Latin markets.

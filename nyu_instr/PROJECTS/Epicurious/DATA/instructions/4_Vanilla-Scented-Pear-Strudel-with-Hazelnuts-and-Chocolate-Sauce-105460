Make vanilla sugar: Combine sugar and vanilla in processor. Blend until beans are very finely chopped, about 1 minute. Sift vanilla sugar into bowl; discard contents of sieve. Transfer vanilla sugar into jar; cover. (Can be made 1 week ahead. Store at room temperature.)
Make sauce: Combine cream, 1/4 cup water and 3 tablespoons vanilla sugar in medium saucepan. Stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves and mixture comes to a boil. Remove from heat. Add chocolate; whisk until smooth. Whisk in brandy. (Can be made 1 week ahead. Cover; chill. Rewarm before serving.)
Make filling: Mix 1/4 cup vanilla sugar and cornstarch in bowl. Melt butter in large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add pears; sauté until tender and golden, about 20 minutes. Sprinkle cornstarch mixture over pears; stir to blend.
Simmer until juices are very thick, stirring often, about 6 minutes (longer if pears are very juicy). Remove from heat. Mix in lemon juice. Cool.
Make strudel and phyllo triangles: Finely grind nuts, cookies and 2 tablespoons vanilla sugar in processor. Transfer nut mixture to small bowl.
Butter 1 baking sheet. Place kitchen towel on work surface. Place 1 phyllo sheet on towel (keep remaining phyllo sheets covered with plastic wrap and damp towel). Brush phyllo with butter. Top with second phyllo sheet; brush with butter.
Sprinkle with 3 tablespoons nut mixture. Repeat layering with 6 more phyllo sheets, buttering and sprinkling each with 3 tablespoons nut mixture. Top with another phyllo sheet (for a total of 10 sheets); brush with butter.
Starting 2 inches in from 1 long side and 2 1/2 inches in from 1 short side, spoon filling in 3-inch-wide by 12-inch-long log parallel to 1 long side.
Fold short sides over filling; butter folded edges.
Using towel as aid and starting at 1 long side, roll up strudel, enclosing filling.
Using large spatula, transfer strudel to prepared baking sheet. Brush strudel all over with butter. (Can be made 4 hours ahead. Cover; chill.)
Meanwhile, prepare triangles. Preheat oven to 375°F. Butter 1 baking sheet. Cut remaining 2 phyllo sheets in half crosswise, making 4 pieces, each about 12 by 8 inches. Place 1 phyllo piece on work surface. Brush phyllo with butter; sprinkle with 1 tablespoon nut mixture and 1 teaspoon vanilla sugar. Repeat layering with 2 more phyllo pieces, buttering and sprinkling each with 1 tablespoon nut mixture and 1 teaspoon vanilla sugar. Top with remaining phyllo piece; brush with butter. Using large knife, trim stack to 12 by 8 inches. Cut stack into six 4-inch squares. Cut squares diagonally in half.
Transfer triangles to prepared baking sheet. Brush parchment with butter; place buttered side down on triangles. Press 1 baking sheet atop parchment, anchoring triangles.
Bake triangles until golden, about 10 minutes. Lift off top baking sheet. Carefully remove parchment. Transfer triangles to rack; cool. (Can be made 4 hours ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.)
Preheat oven to 375°F. Stack baking sheet with strudel atop another baking sheet. Bake strudel until golden brown, about 45 minutes. Let stand at least 15 minutes and up to 4 hours.

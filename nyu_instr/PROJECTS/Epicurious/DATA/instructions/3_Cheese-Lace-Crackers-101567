In a food processor blend the Cheddar, the butter, the flour, the Worcesteshire sauce, the salt, and the cayenne until the mixture forms a ball of dough. Halve the dough, putting each half on a sheet of wax paper, and with the aid of the wax paper form it into logs about 6 inches long and 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Chill the dough, wrapped in the wax paper, for at least 2 hours, or unitl it is firm enough to slice. The dough may be prepared up to this point 2 days in advance and kept covered and chilled. It may also be frozen for several weeks. Cut the dough into 1/4-inch slices, arrange the slices 2 inches apart on jelly-roll pans, and bake them in a preheated 400°F. oven for 5 to 7 minutes, or until they are golden brown around the edges. Transfer the crackers carefully with a metal spatula to racks, let them cool, and drain them on paper towels if desired. The crackers keep for up to 4 days in an airtight container.

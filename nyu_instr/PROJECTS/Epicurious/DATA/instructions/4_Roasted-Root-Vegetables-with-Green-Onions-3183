Preheat oven to 350°F. Mix oil, syrup and garlic in small bowl. Place all remaining ingredients except butter and green onions on heavy large rimmed baking sheet. Pour oil mixture over; toss to coat. Spread out vegetables in single layer. Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. Roast until tender and golden brown, stirring occasionally, about 1 1/2 hours. Transfer vegetables to platter. Drizzle vegetables with butter. Sprinkle with chopped green onions and serve immediately.

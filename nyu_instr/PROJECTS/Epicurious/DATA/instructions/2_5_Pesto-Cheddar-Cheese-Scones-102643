Preheat oven to 375°F. Sprinkle each of 2 baking sheets with 1 tablespoon cornmeal. Combine remaining 1/2 cup cornmeal and next 4 ingredients in processor; blend 5 seconds. Add butter and process, using on/off turns, until coarse meal forms. Add cheese and mix in, using 3 on/off turns. Transfer flour mixture to large bowl. Whisk 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons milk, pesto and egg in small bowl to blend. Gradually add milk mixture to flour mixture, stirring until dough just comes together and adding more milk by tablespoonfuls if dough is dry.
Turn dough out onto lightly floured work surface. Knead gently until smooth, about 5 turns. Pat out dough to 1-inch thickness. Using floured 2-inch-diameter cutter, cut out scones. Gather dough scraps; pat out to 1-inch thickness. Cut out additional scones. Repeat if more dough remains. Transfer scones to prepared sheets, spacing 2 inches apart.
Bake scones until pale golden and tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Place scones in basket and serve warm.

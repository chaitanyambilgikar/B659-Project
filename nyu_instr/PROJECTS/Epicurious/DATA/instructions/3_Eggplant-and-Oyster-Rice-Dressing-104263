Bring water and salt to a boil in a 3-quart saucepan. Add rice and cook, covered, over low heat until water is absorbed and rice is just cooked through, 18 to 20 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl and fluff with a fork.
Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then cook eggplant in batches, turning it and adding up to 4 tablespoons of remaining oil as necessary, until tender and browned, about 5 minutes. Transfer to paper towels to drain. When cool enough to handle, cut eggplant into 1/2-inch pieces.
Preheat oven to 325°F.
Heat remaining oil in skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then sauté onion and bell pepper, stirring, until softened and edges are browned. Add garlic, oysters (without liquor), and eggplant and sauté, stirring occasionally, 1 minute.
Gently toss eggplant mixture, oyster liquor, 1/2 cup scallions, cayenne, and salt to taste with rice in bowl and transfer to a buttered 3-quart shallow baking dish. Cover with foil and bake in middle of oven 1 1/2 hours. Remove foil and stir in remaining 1/2 cup scallions.

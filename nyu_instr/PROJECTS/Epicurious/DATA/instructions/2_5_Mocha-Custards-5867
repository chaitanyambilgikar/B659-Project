Preheat oven to 325°F. Arrange six 3/4-cup soufflé dishes or custard cups in 13 x 9 x 2-inch baking pan. Using wooden spoon, stir sugar, yolks, liqueur and vanilla extract in medium bowl to blend well. Stir half and half, chocolate and coffee powder in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat until chocolate melts and mixture just comes to simmer. Very gradually stir hot mixture into yolk mixture. Strain custard into spouted measuring cup; pour custard into dishes.
Pour enough hot water into pan to come halfway up sides of dishes. Bake custards until just set in center when pan is gently shaken, about 45 minutes. Transfer custards to rack; cool 1 hour. Cover and refrigerate until very cold, about 4 hours. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Keep refrigerated.) Top custards with whipped cream and coffee bean candies and serve.

Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add 1/4 of onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add rice and stir to coat. Add 2 cups water and season with salt. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until rice is just tender, 40-50 minutes.
Remove from heat. Let stand, covered, for 10 minutes. Fluff rice with a fork. Fold in 1/4 cup cilantro; season with salt and pepper.
While rice is cooking, heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add 2/3 of remaining onion. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onion has softened, about 5 minutes.
Add coriander and cumin; stir 1 minute. Add beans and broth; season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer, occasionally mashing beans, until thickened, 8-10 minutes.
Pulse chiles, garlic, ginger, lime zest, lime juice, and remaining onion in a blender until a chunky sauce forms. Season salsa with salt.
Serve rice with beans; top with salsa, avocado, cheese, 1/4 cup cilantro, and lime wedges.

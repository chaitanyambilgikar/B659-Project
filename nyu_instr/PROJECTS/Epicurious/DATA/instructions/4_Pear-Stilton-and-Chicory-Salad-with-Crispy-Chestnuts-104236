Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a 10-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then sauté chestnuts with salt and pepper to taste, stirring, until crisp on outside (being careful not to burn or cook until hard), about 4 minutes. Remove from heat.
Halve and core pears, then cut lengthwise into thin slices.
Whisk together mustard, vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste in a large bowl and add remaining 3 tablespoons oil in a slow stream, whisking until emulsified. Whisk in shallot.
Add chicory, chestnuts, pears, and Stilton and toss until evenly coated. Season with salt and pepper.

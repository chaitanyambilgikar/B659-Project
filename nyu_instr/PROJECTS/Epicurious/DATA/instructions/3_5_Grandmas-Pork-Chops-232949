1. Rub both sides of the chops with the dry rub, coating them generously. Place them in a deep baking dish, overlapping if necessary. Stir the citrus juices, vinegar, and garlic together in a bowl until blended. Pour over the chops and massage into them.
2. Marinate the chops at room temperature for up to 1 hour or in the refrigerator for up to 1 day.
3. Pour enough oil into a large, heavy skillet to film the bottom. (If necessary, work in batches or use two skillets — if you have them and space on the stove to hold them.) Heat the oil over medium heat until rippling. Remove the chops from the marinade and discard the marinade. Add as many chops as will fit in the pan without touching. Cook until the chops are well browned on the underside, about 6 minutes. Turn the chops and cook until they are firm near the bone when you poke them with a finger, about 8 minutes. Keep warm while cooking the second batch, if necessary. Serve immediately.

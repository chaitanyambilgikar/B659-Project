Stir first 4 ingredients in large bowl. Whisk milk, melted butter and eggs in medium bowl. Add to dry ingredients and whisk until blended but small lumps remain. Let stand 30 minutes.
Melt 1 tablespoon butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Drop batter by scant 1/4 cupfuls into skillet. Cook pancakes until bottoms are golden brown and bubbles form on top, about 2 minutes. Turn and cook until bottoms are golden brown, about 1 minute. Transfer to platter. Tent griddle cakes with foil to keep warm. Repeat with remaining batter, adding more butter to skillet as necessary.
Serve pancakes hot with raspberry jam and maple syrup.

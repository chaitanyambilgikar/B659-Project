Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add bell pepper, garlic, oregano and dried red pepper. Sauté until bell pepper is almost tender, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes and wine and simmer until flavors blend, about 2 minutes. Add clams. Cover and cook until clams open, about 8 minutes. Using tongs, transfer clams to bowl (discard any that do not open). Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.
Divide spaghetti among 4 bowls. Top with sauce and clams and serve.

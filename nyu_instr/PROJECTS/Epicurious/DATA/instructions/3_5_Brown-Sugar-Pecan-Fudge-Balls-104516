Coat inside of medium metal bowl with 1/2 teaspoon butter. Place remaining butter in same bowl; set aside.
Combine sugars, half and half and salt in medium saucepan thatâ€™s at least 4 inches deep. Let stand 10 minutes. Stir over medium-low heat until sugars are almost dissolved, frequently brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush, about 12 minutes. Increase heat to medium. Continue to stir until syrup comes to boil, occasionally brushing down sides of pan, about 10 minutes longer. Attach candy thermometer. Boil syrup without stirring until candy thermometer registers 234Â°F, about 16 minutes (caramel will bubble vigorously in pan).
Attach thermometer to bowl with butter. Pour caramel over butter (do not scrape pan). Add vanilla (but do not stir). Cool caramel just to 112°F, about 1 hour 30 minutes. Using electric mixer, beat caramel until sheen just begins to disappear and mixture thickens slightly, about 4 minutes. Stir in chopped pecans. Cool mixture until thick enough to roll into balls, about 2 hours.
Line 4 baking sheets with waxed paper. Using about 1 tablespoon mixture for each ball, spoon mixture in 48 mounds on 1 sheet. Press or roll each mound between palms of hands into ball. Refrigerate 30 minutes.
Stir chocolate in medium bowl set over saucepan of barely simmering water until smooth and candy thermometer registers 115°F (do not allow bottom of bowl to touch water). Remove from over water. Drop 1 ball into chocolate. Using fork, turn to coat. Using fork tines, lift ball from chocolate, allowing excess to drip into bowl. Using knife as aid, slide ball off fork onto second prepared sheet. Repeat with 15 balls, rewarming chocolate as needed to maintain temperature of 115°F. While chocolate is still wet, sprinkle with 1/4 cup sprinkles. Repeat with remaining fudge balls and sprinkles in 2 more batches, placing 16 balls on each of remaining 2 unused sheets.
Chill balls until coating is firm, about 30 minutes. (Can be prepared 2 weeks ahead. Refrigerate in covered containers.) Let stand 20 minutes at room temperature before serving.

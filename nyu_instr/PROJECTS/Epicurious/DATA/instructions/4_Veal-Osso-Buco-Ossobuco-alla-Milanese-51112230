1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. In a heavy pot over moderately high heat, warm the olive oil.
2. Generously season the osso buco with salt and pepper, then dredge completely in the flour.
3. Add the onion, leek, carrots, and celery to the oil in the skillet and sauté, stirring frequently, until softened, about 4 minutes. Push the vegetables to the outside of the pan and add the osso buco. Sear each side of the osso buco until deep golden brown, about 8 minutes total.
4. Add the wine, sage, rosemary, bay leaf, 2 tablespoons of parsley, tomatoes, and stock, and bring to a boil. Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and transfer it to the oven. Braise until the meat is very tender and can be easily pulled apart with a fork, about 2 hours.
5. Remove the osso buco from the pot and, if desired, reduce the sauce on the stovetop. Remove and discard the herb stems before serving. Prepare a gremolata by stirring together the lemon zest and the remaining chopped parsley. Serve the osso buco garnished with sauce and the gremolata.

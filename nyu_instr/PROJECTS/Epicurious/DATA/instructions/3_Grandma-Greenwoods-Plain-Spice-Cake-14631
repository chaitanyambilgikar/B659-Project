Preheat oven to 350°F and butter and flour a loaf pan, 9 1/4 by 5 1/4 by 2 3/4 inches, knocking out excess flour.
Into a bowl sift together flour, baking soda, cinnamon, cloves, and salt.
In a large bowl with an electric mixer cream shortening with sugar until light and fluffy. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Add flour mixture alternately with buttermilk in batches, beginning and ending with flour mixture and beating batter after each addition until just combined. Stir in raisins.
Pour batter into pan and bake in middle of oven 50 to 60 minutes, or until a tester comes out clean. Cool cake in pan on a rack 10 minutes and turn out onto rack to cool completely.

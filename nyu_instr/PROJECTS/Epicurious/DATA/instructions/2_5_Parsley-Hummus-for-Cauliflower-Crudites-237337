Coarsely chop garlic and parsley leaves in processor. Add garbanzo beans to processor and blend 30 seconds. Add sour cream, tahini, Asian sesame oil, lemon peel, cumin, salt, and cayenne pepper; blend until smooth.
Serve the hummus with a mix of purple, white, and green cauliflower; steam the florets in 3 separate batches until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes.

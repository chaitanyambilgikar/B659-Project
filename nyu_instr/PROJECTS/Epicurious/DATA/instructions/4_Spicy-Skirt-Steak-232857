At home One hour before packing, mix together the olive oil, lime juice, garlic, cumin, and coriander. Place the steaks in a resealable freezer bag and pour in the marinade, making sure the steaks are completely coated. Refrigerate.
At the tailgate Prepare coals for a hot fire. When the coals are ready, transfer the skirt steaks directly from the marinade to the grill and cook for 8 to 9 minutes, turning once, for medium-rare, 9 to 10 minutes for medium. Transfer the steaks to a cutting board and let them rest for 5 minutes. While the steaks are resting, transfer the sliced onion, pepper, and cilantro to a medium serving bowl. Place the limes, cut side down, on the grill until they brown slightly, about 4 minutes. Set aside. Cut the steaks into 1/2-inch strips, then add them to the bowl with the onion mixture. Season with the hot sauce and salt, then squeeze the grilled limes over everything. Toss together and serve.

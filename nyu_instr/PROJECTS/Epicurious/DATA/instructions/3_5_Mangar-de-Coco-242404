Sprinkle gelatin over cold water and let stand 2 minutes to soften.
Bring milk, 1 cup sugar, and 1/8 teaspoon salt to a boil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring until sugar has dissolved. Remove from heat and stir in gelatin mixture until dissolved. Stir in coconut milk until smooth and cool to room temperature, stirring occasionally, about 45 minutes.
Beat egg whites with an electric mixer at medium-high speed until they just hold soft peaks. Beat in remaining 1/2 cup sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating until whites hold stiff glossy peaks. Gently stir one third of egg-white mixture into coconut mixture with a whisk, then add remaining egg-white mixture, stirring to break up any lumps.
Pour into bundt pan and chill, uncovered, until set, at least 4 hours.
To unmold, gently separate gelatin from pan using a rubber spatula. Fill a large bowl with very warm water, then dip pan (do not submerge) in water 15 seconds. Invert a large plate over pan, then invert gelatin onto plate, gently lifting off pan.

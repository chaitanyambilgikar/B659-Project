For crust: Preheat oven to 325°F. Combine first 5 ingredients in processor. Blend until nuts are finely ground. Add butter and cut in using on/off turns until dough begins to clump together. Press dough over bottom (not sides) of 9-inch-diameter springform pan with 2 3/4-inch-high sides. Bake until golden brown, about 25 minutes. Cool. Maintain oven temperature.
For filling and topping: Bring 2 cups cream to boil in heavy medium saucepan. Remove from heat. Add both chocolates; whisk until smooth. Whisk eggs, 2 teaspoons espresso powder and vanilla in large bowl to blend. Gradually whisk in chocolate mixture (filling will be very thin). Pour over crust (filling will fill pan only halfway). Bake until filling moves only slightly in center when pan is shaken, about 55 minutes. Chill until cold, at least 2 hours.
Sprinkle gelatin over 2 tablespoons water in small bowl. Let stand 10 minutes to soften. Set bowl in saucepan of simmering water and stir until gelatin dissolves. Remove from heat. Using electric mixer, beat 1 cup chilled cream, powdered sugar and 1 teaspoon espresso powder in large bowl to soft peaks. Gradually beat in gelatin mixture. Spoon whipped cream over filling; smooth top. Chill until set, about 3 hours. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Cover; keep chilled.)
Run knife between torte and pan sides to loosen; remove pan sides. Transfer torte to platter. Sprinkle with chocolate shavings, if desired, and serve.

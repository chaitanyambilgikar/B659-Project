Lightly butter 1 side of each bread slice. Place 1 cheese slice on buttered side of each of 4 bread slices. Top with ham slice and another cheese slice. Close sandwiches with remaining bread slices, buttered side in.
Melt 2 tablespoons butter in heavy large skillet over medium-low heat. Add sandwiches in batches and cook until golden brown, adding more butter as necessary, about 2 minutes per side. Serve immediately.

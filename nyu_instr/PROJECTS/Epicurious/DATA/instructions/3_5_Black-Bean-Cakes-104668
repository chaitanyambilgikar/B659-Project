1. Place the beans in a medium pot. Cover with 1/2-inch cold water. Bring to a boil, and reduce the heat to simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until very tender, about 30 minutes. Add water if necessary while cooking to keep the beans submerged.
2. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add onion, peppers, and garlic. Cook until soft, 2 to 3 minutes. Add to beans. Add honey, cider vinegar, chili powder, and cumin. Season with salt and pepper. Continue cooking, stirring frequently, until beans have absorbed water and broken down, 10 to 15 minutes more.
3. Remove beans from the heat. In a food processor fitted with the blade attachment puree until smooth. Return mixture to the cooking pot. Over medium heat, cook the beans, stirring often, until dry. Transfer to a bowl, and set aside until cool enough to handle, about 10 minutes.
4. Using lightly floured hands, shape about 1/3-cup of bean mixture into a cake about 3 inches wide and 1/2 inch thick. Repeat with remaining mixture. Lightly dust cakes with flour. Set aside.
5. Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Without crowding, place bean cakes in pan and cook until browned, about 2 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining mixture, wiping out skillet between batches and adding oil as needed. Serve 2 cakes per person. Garnish each plate with a dollop of sour cream and a sprig of cilantro.

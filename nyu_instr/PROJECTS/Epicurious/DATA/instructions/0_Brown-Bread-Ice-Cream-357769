Make the Ballymaloe vanilla ice cream and freeze.
Preheat the oven to 450°F.
Spread the chunky bread crumbs on a baking sheet. Sprinkle with sugar and toast in the oven for 10–15 minutes. Stir every 4 or 5 minutes until the sugar caramelizes and coats the bread crumbs. Spread onto a Silpat mat and let cool. Then pulse the caramelized bread crumbs into small, chunky bits in a food processor.
When the ice cream is semi-frozen, fold in the bread crumbs and freeze until fully frozen.

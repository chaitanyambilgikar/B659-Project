Peel and coarsely grate 1 pound fresh horseradish root. Combine grated horseradish, 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar, and 2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt in a food processor; pulse 4 or 5 times, or until the horseradish begins to break down. Add 6 tablespoons more vinegar, a tablespoonful at a time, until mixture forms a coarse paste. Transfer mixture to a jar and refrigerate for up to 1 month.

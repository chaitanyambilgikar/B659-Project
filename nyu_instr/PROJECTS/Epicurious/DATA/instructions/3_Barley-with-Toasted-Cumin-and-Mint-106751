Bring water, barley, salt, and turmeric to a boil in a 2-quart heavy saucepan, then simmer, covered, until barley is tender, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, 5 minutes. Drain barley in a colander and transfer to a bowl. Stir in mint, onion (to taste), lemon juice, cumin, oil, and salt and pepper to taste.

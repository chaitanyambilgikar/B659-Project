Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease an 8-inch square baking dish with grapeseed oil and dust with almond flour.
To make the shortbread, blend the almond flour, salt, grapeseed oil, and agave nectar in a food processor until smooth. Press the dough into the prepared baking dish.
Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until golden brown. Remove from the oven and let cool.
While the shortbread bakes, prepare the pralines. In a small saucepan over medium-low heat, melt the butter, then add the agave nectar and vanilla extract. Simmer for 5 minutes, then add the pecans. Remove the praline mixture from the heat, cool to room temperature, and spread over the shortbread.
Place in the refrigerator for 3 hours to set. Cut into squares and serve.

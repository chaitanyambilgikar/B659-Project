1. A day in advance, crumble the tofu into a plastic container. Freeze overnight or for up to 4 hours. Thaw the tofu and pat it dry with a paper towel before using.
2. Preheat oven to 350°F. In a small bowl, whisk together the topping ingredients.
3. In a large bowl, break up the tofu with your hands. Add the remaining loaf ingredients and combine well. Pat the mixture into a 9-by-5-inch loaf pan. Bake for 45 minutes.
4. Remove the loaf and brush it with the topping, then return it to the oven and bake for 15 minutes more.
5. Remove and let the loaf cool for 5 minutes before slicing and serving.

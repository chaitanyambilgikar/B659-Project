Bring water, vinegar and lemon juice to a boil in a large pot. Reserve 10 basil leaves. Bruise the remainder, add to the pot, remove from the heat, cover and let steep for 15 minutes. Add the sugar and vegetable coloring, return to heat and bring to a boil, stirring constantly, until sugar dissolves. When the syrup is at a full rolling boil, add the pectin, boil for 1/2 minute and remove from heat. Place 2 basil leaves in the bottom of each of 5 hot, sterilized 8-ounce jelly glasses . Strain the jelly into glasses through a fine sieve. Cool and cover with a layer of thin paraffin. When the paraffin has hardened, cover the glasses and store.

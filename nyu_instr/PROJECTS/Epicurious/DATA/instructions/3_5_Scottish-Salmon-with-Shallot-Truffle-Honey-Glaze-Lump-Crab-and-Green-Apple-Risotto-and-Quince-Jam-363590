Make the quince jam: In a medium saucepan over moderate heat, bring the quince, sugar, vinegar, and 1 1/2 cups of water to a boil. Add the vanilla (or scrape in vanilla seeds), lemon juice, and zest then lower the heat, cover, and simmer until the jam is thickened and reduced by half, about 25 minutes. Let the jam cool for 1 hour.
Cook the salmon: In a medium saucepan over moderate heat, warm the vegetable oil. Sprinkle the salmon with salt and pepper, add to the pan, and cook, flipping once, until just cooked through, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer the salmon to an oven-safe pan and cover. Do not clean the saucepan.
Make the shallot-truffle honey glaze: Place the pan you used for the salmon over low heat and melt the butter. Add the shallots and sauté, stirring often, until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the sugar and vinegar and cook until the sugar is dissolved, about 1 minute. Let cool, then transfer to a blender. Add the honey and truffle oil and purée until combined.
Make the lump crab and green apple risotto: In a medium saucepan over low heat, combine all the ingredients and cook, stirring often, until the risotto starts to stick to itself and becomes creamy, about 2 minutes.
Finish the salmon: Preheat the broiler. Brush the salmon with the shallot-truffle honey glaze and place under the broiler until warmed through, about 1 minute.
To serve: Divide the risotto among 4 plates. Cut the salmon into four servings and arrange on top of the risotto. Drizzle each piece of fish with 1 tablespoon quince jam and serve immediately.

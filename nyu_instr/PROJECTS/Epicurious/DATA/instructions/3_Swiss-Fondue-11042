Rub the inside of a heavy saucepan with the garlic, add the wine, and heat it over moderately low heat until the cheese is melted and the mixture hot. Add the Gruyère by the handfuls, stirring, until the cheese is melted and the mixture is blended well, and keep the mixture just below the simmering point. In a small bowl stir together well the cornstarch and 1/4 cup of the kirsch, add the mixture to the Gruyère mixture with the nutmeg and pepper to taste, and heat the fondue, stirring constantly, until it just begins to bubble, but do not let it boil. Transfer the fondue to a heated fondue pot and keep it hot over a low flame. If the fondue becomes too thick, add some of the additional kirsch. Spear the bread cubes with long-handled forks and dip them into the fondue.

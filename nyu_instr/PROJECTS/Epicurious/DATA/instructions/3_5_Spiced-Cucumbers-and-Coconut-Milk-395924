Heat vegetable oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add slices peeled lemon cucumber or any other cucumber. Sauté until beginning to soften, about 1 minute. Season with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Add chopped small tomatoes, sliced scallions, sliced red thai chiles (with seeds), and smashed garlic clove. Sauté until vegetables are soft, 2–3 minutes. Add unsweetened coconut milk and honey; simmer until vegetables are cooked through, 2–3 minutes. Stir in fresh cilantro leaves and a squeeze of fresh lime juice. Season with salt and pepper. Serve with rice, if desired.

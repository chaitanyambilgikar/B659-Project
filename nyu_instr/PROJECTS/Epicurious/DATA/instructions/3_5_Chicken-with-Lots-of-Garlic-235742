Pat chicken dry and sprinkle with pepper and 3/4 teaspoon salt. Dredge chicken in flour, shaking off excess.
Heat oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking. Brown chicken in 2 batches, turning over once, about 5 minutes total per batch. Transfer to a plate.
Add garlic to skillet and cook, stirring, until just golden, about 2 minutes. Add wine and boil 1 minute. Add broth, then cover skillet and simmer until garlic is tender, about 15 minutes. Return chicken, skin side up, to skillet and simmer, covered, until just cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer chicken to a platter. Mash 8 garlic cloves into sauce and season with remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt. Sprinkle with parsley. Spoon sauce and garlic over chicken.

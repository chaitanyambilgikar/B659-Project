In a small bowl sprinkle the yeast over 1 1/4 cups warm water, let it proof for 5 minutes, or until it is foamy, and stir in the oil. In a large bowl whisk together 3 1/2 cups of the flour, the salt, and the Parmesan, stir in the yeast mixture, and turn the dough out onto a floured surface. Knead the dough, incorporating as much of the remaining 1/2 cup flour as necessary to prevent the dough from sticking, for 8 to 10 minutes, or until it is smooth and elastic. Form the dough into a ball, put it into an oiled bowl, and turn it to coat it with the oil. Let the dough rise, covered with plastic wrap, in a warm place for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, or until it is double in bulk. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface, divide it into a 12 equal pieces, and form each piece into a ball. Transfer the rolls to a lightly oiled baking sheet and let them rise, covered loosely with a kitchen towel, in a warm place for 1 hour, or until they are almost double in bulk. Bake the rolls in the middle of a preheated 425°F. oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until they are golden.

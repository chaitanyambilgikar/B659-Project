Preheat the oven to 500°F. Pat dry the fillet and season it with salt and pepper. In an oiled roasting pan roast the fillet in the middle of the oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until a meat thermometer registers 130°F for medium-rare meat, and let it cool to room temperature. The fillet may be roasted 2 days in advance and kept wrapped and chilled. Slice the fillet crosswise, arrange it on a cutting board or platter, and garnish it with the parsley. Serve the beef with the sauces.

Coarsely grind fennel seeds and red pepper flakes in a spice mill or with a mortar and pestle. Alternatively, place in a resealable freezer bag. Crush with a rolling pin or large skillet. Set aside.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add sliced fennel, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring often, until soft, 10-12 minutes. Add spices and cook, stirring often, until spices are beginning to darken, about 1 minute.
Add marinara sauce and 1/2 cup water to skillet; bring to a simmer and cook to meld flavors, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
Season fish with salt and pepper and fold fillets in thirds or in half to form packets. Place fillets in sauce. Cover skillet and reduce heat to medium-low. Cook until fish is opaque and beginning to flake, 12-15 minutes.
Divide fennel-tomato sauce and fish among shallow bowls. Sprinkle tarragon and fennel fronds over.

Preheat oven to 350°F. Sauté sausage in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat until brown, breaking up clumps with back of spoon, about 7 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer sausage to 8x8x2-inch glass baking dish or other ovenproof pan. Mix chopped green chilies, 3 tablespoons cilantro and hot sauce into sausage. Sprinkle cheddar cheese, Monterey Jack cheese, then remaining 1 tablespoon cilantro over sausage mixture. Bake casserole 10 minutes.
Wrap tortillas tightly in foil. Place in oven to heat through alongside sausage casserole. Continue to bake casserole until cheeses bubble and sausage mixture is heated through, about 10 minutes longer.
Serve sausage and cheese mixture with warm tortillas.

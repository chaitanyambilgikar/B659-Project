For dip: Mix all ingredients in small bowl to blend. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate until flavors blend, at least 1 hour or overnight.
For fritters: Whisk flour, salt, baking soda and cayenne pepper in medium bowl to blend. Mix in drained clams, corn, green onions and egg. Stir in 1/2 cup buttermilk. Mix in enough remaining buttermilk to form stiff batter (do not overmix).
Pour enough vegetable oil into heavy large skillet to reach depth of 1 inch. Heat oil to 350°F over medium heat. Working in batches, drop batter by heaping teaspoonfuls into oil. Cook until fritters are golden brown, turning once, about 2 1/2 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer to rack to drain. Serve hot, passing cilantro dip separately.

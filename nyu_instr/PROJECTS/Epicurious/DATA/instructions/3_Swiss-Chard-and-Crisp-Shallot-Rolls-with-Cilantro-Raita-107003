Fry shallots: Heat oil in a 1-quart saucepan over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking (365°F on deep-fat thermometer), then fry shallots in 3 batches, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer as fried with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain, spreading evenly, then cool.
Make rolls: Cook chard leaves in a large pot of boiling salted water until tender, about 2 minutes. Transfer with tongs to a bowl of ice and cold water to stop cooking. Drain well and pat dry with paper towels.
Halve each leaf lengthwise, discarding rib. Place 1 tablespoon shallots at 1 end of a chard strip and firmly roll up, forming a cigar shape. Make 15 more rolls in same manner.
Make raita: Mash garlic to a paste with sea salt using a mortar and pestle (or mince and mash with a large heavy knife). Purée cilantro with garlic paste and 1/4 cup yogurt in a blender, scraping down sides occasionally. Transfer to a bowl and stir in remaining 3/4 cup yogurt. Serve chard rolls with raita.

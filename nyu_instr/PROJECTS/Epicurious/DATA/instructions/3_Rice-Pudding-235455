In large saucepan over medium heat, bring 1 cup water to boil. Stir in rice, cover, and return to boil. Lower heat and simmer until water is absorbed, about 10 minutes.
While rice is cooking, pour milk into large bowl. Whisk in sugar and cornstarch until dissolved. Stir in rosewater. When rice is cooked, raise heat to high, pour milk mixture over, and stir constantly until mixture returns to boil. Lower heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until rice and milk are incorporated, about 30 minutes. Pour into 4 ramekins or 1 medium-sized glass baking dish and chill, covered, at least 3 hours.
Sprinkle with almonds and cinnamon just before serving.

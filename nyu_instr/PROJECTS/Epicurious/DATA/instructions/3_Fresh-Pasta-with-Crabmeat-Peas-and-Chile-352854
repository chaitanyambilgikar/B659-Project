Cook fettuccine in a pasta pot of well-salted boiling water until al dente, about 3 minutes. Reserve 1 cup cooking water, then drain pasta.
While pasta water comes to a boil, cook spring onions in 1 tablespoon oil and 1 tablespoon butter in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 2 minutes. Add 1/2 cup pasta-cooking water, peas, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper and cook 1 minute. Add crab and cook until heated through, about 2 minutes. Add pasta, lemon juice, cheese, chile, and remaining tablespoon each of oil and butter and stir to combine well, adding more cooking water to moisten if necessary. Remove from heat and stir in all but 1 tablespoon parsley. Serve pasta sprinkled with remaining parsley.

Bring 6 cups water, 1/4 cup butter, and 1 teaspoon salt to boil in heavy large saucepan. Gradually whisk in polenta. Reduce heat to medium-low. Stir constantly until polenta thickens, about 5 minutes.
*Quick-cooking polenta (precooked maize meal) is available at some supermarkets and at Italian markets.

In a 3-quart microwave-safe casserole with a tight-fitting lid microwave 1 tablespoon of the butter, uncovered, at high power (100%) for 1 minute, or until it is melted, stir in the mushrooms, the garlic, and the salt, and microwave the mixture, uncovered, at high power for 5 minutes. Add the barley and the water, microwave the mixture, covered, at high power for 12 minutes, and microwave it, covered, at medium power (50%) for 25 minutes, or until most of the liquid is absorbed and the barley is al dente. Stir in the remaining 1 tablespoon butter, cut into bits, the Parmesan, the parsley, and salt and pepper to taste.

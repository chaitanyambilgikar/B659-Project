Butter six 3/4-cup ramekins; dust with sugar. Melt 1/2 cup butter in heavy medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Add sugar and stir until mixture is opaque, about 2 minutes. Stir in lemon juice and lemon peel. Whisk in yolks. Cook over medium-low heat until mixture thickens and thermometer registers 180°F, whisking constantly, about 12 minutes (do not boil). Transfer mixture to large bowl and cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes.
Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 400°F. Using electric mixer, beat egg whites in another large bowl until stiff but not dry. Fold 1/4 of beaten egg whites into lemon mixture to lighten. Fold remaining beaten egg whites into lemon mixture.
Divide souffl° mixture among prepared ramekins. Place filled ramekins in large roasting pan. Fill pan with enough hot water to come halfway up sides of ramekins. Bake souffl°s until golden brown on top, about 14 minutes. Using tongs as aid, remove souffl°s from water and serve immediately.

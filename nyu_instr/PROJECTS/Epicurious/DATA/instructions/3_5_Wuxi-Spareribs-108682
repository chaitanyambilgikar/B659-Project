Blanch whole scallion in a 4-quart pot of boiling water until softened, about 1 minute. Transfer scallion to a work surface and return pot of water to a boil. Add ribs to boiling water and return to a boil, then immediately drain ribs in a colander. Transfer ribs to a wide 2 1/2- to 3-quart heavy pot. Carefully tie blanched scallion into a knot and add to pot with ribs.
Add wine, soy sauces, 3 cups water, ginger, anise, cinnamon, sugar, and pepper to pot with ribs and simmer, covered, until meat is just tender, about 1 hour. Remove lid and boil over moderately high heat, stirring occasionally, until sauce is reduced by three fourths and meat is very tender, about 20 minutes more. Whisk together cornstarch and remaining tablespoon water in a cup. Reduce heat to moderate and add cornstarch mixture to ribs, then cook, stirring, until sauce is thickened, about 1 minute. Remove from heat and stir in sesame oil. Serve sprinkled with chopped scallion and cilantro.

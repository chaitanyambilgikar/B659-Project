Cut twelve 1/4-inch-thick rounds from the middle of the potato, discarding the ends, pat them dry with paper towels, and brush them on both sides with the oil. Roast the potato slices on a baking sheet in the upper third of a preheated 500°F. oven for 6 minutes, or until the undersides are golden. Turn the slices, roast them for 6 minutes more, or until the undersides are golden and crisp, and let them cool until they can be handled.
While the potatoes are roasting, in a bowl stir together the cream cheese, the tomatoes, the scallion, and salt and pepper to taste. Spread the filling on half the potato slices, top it with the remaining potato slices, pressing the slices together to form sandwiches, and halve the sandwiches.

Cook bacon in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat until brown and crisp, about 5 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towels and drain. Discard all but 2 tablespoons drippings from pan. Add onion; sauté until beginning to soften, about 3 minutes. Add broth and potato. Cover pan; simmer 5 minutes. Add corn, chicken and thyme. Partially cover pan; simmer until chicken is cooked through and vegetables are tender, about 8 minutes. Add half and half and bring to simmer, about 2 minutes. Season chowder to taste with salt and pepper. Ladle into bowls. Sprinkle with cooked bacon and serve.

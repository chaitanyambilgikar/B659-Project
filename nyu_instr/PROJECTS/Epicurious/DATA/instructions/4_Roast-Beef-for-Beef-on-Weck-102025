1. Let meat stand at cool room temperature about 45 minutes before roasting.
2. Preheat oven to 450°F.
3. Put roast on a metal rack in a roasting pan (fat side up) and sprinkle generously with salt and pepper.
4. Add about 1/4 inch water to bottom of pan and put roast in middle of oven. Immediately reduce temperature to 350Â°F and roast meat until an instant-read thermometer inserted in center registers 120Â°F. Cooking time will varyâ€”it will be anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes per poundâ€”depending on size of roast. (120Â°F means rare, which is traditional for beef on weck. Internal temperature of meat will rise about 5Â°F as roast stands.)
5. Let roast stand, loosely covered with foil, 10 to 15 minutes before slicing.

Preheat oven to 300°F. Lightly oil rimmed baking sheet. Arrange tomatoes, cut side up, on prepared sheet. Drizzle 2 tablespoons oil over tomatoes. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Bake until tomatoes look slightly shriveled and are slightly brown around edges, about 1 hour 30 minutes. (Can be prepared 3 days ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Bring to room temperature before using.)

1. Combine the shrimp in a saucepan with water to cover. Turn the heat to high and bring to a boil. Cover the pan, remove from the heat, and let sit for 5 minutes. Drain and chill (you can run the shrimp under cold water if you're in a hurry).
2. Combine the ketchup, vinegar, and butter in a small saucepan and cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the butter melts. (At this point, you can keep the sauce warm for over an hour — but keep the heat as low as possible.) Add horseradish to taste.
3. Serve the cold shrimp with the sauce, warm or cold.
Keys to Success
The easiest way to cook shrimp is to let them steep in hot water until they're done; they will cook through but not overcook, and thus remain tender. Peel them before cooking.
With Minimal Effort
If you have fresh horseradish, grate it and serve it separately from the sauce; dip the shrimp into the ketchup sauce and then into the horseradish.
Use fresh lemon juice instead of vinegar and/or Tabasco or other hot sauce in place of the horseradish.
Cook the shrimp with herbs or spices, such as a premixed combination of pickling spices, or simply a couple of bay leaves, some peppercorns, and some whole coriander seeds.
Wine: Chardonnay or Pinot Blanc
Serve With: If you serve this as an appetizer, follow with pasta or risotto. If you serve this as a main course, serve with bread and a steamed vegetable

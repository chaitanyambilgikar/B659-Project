To prepare the charmoula: 1. In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the onion, garlic, paprika, cayenne, cumin, 1/3 cup water, olive oil, and some salt and pepper to taste. Let rest at room temperature for 10 minutes to blend the flavors.
To prepare the zucchini: 1. In a large skillet over medium heat, warm the oil. Add the zucchini and briefly sauté until just tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
2. Add the prepared charmoula, lemon juice, and herbs to the skillet, and continue cooking for 1 minute. Serve warm or at room temperature.

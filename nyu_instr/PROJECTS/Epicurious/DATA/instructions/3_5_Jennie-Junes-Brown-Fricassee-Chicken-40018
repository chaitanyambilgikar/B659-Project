1. Brown the chicken in 2 tablespoons of the oil in a heavy sauté pan and set aside.
2. Drain the pan, add the remaining oil, and simmer the onions very slowly, covered, for about 15 minutes or until soft. Remove the cover, add the garlic, and sauté until the onions are golden.
3. Add the tomatoes and simmer a few minutes. Then add the chicken, the thyme, salt, pepper, allspice, mace, and water. Cover and cook for a half hour or until the chicken is tender, adding water if sauce is too thick.

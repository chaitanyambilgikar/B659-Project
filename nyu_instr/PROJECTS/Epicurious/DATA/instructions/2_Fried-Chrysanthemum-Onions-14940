Trim root end of 1 onion flush and cut 1/2-inch slice from opposite end. Repeat procedure with remaining onion. Stand 1 onion on cutting board, root end up, and with tip of a paring knife inserted just outside of root base, make vertical cuts through onion at 1/4-inch intervals, rotating through onion as you go and leaving root end intact. Repeat procedure with remaining onion. Turn onions root end down and gently open cuts to form chrysanthemum shape.
In a 4-quart heavy saucepan heat oil over moderate heat until a deep-fat thermometer registers 375°F.
Put milk and flour in 2 separate small bowls and season flour with salt. Put bread crumbs in a bowl. Working with 1 onion at a time, dip onions into milk, spooning milk over centers to moisten and letting excess drip off. Dip onions into flour, spooning flour into centers to coat and gently shaking off excess.
To remaining milk in bowl add egg, beating with a fork until combined well. Working with 1 onion at a time, dip onion into egg mixture, spooning egg mixture into centers to coat. Roll onions into bread crumbs, sprinkling bread crumbs into centers an gently shaking off excess.
Fry onions, 1 at a time, in oil until golden brown, about 5 minutes, returning oil to 375°F between onions. Transfer onions as fried to brown paper to drain.

Chop leek and wash in a bowl of cold water, agitating it, then lift out and pat dry.
Cook parsley stems and leek in oil in a 2- to 3-quart heavy saucepan over moderately low heat, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add zucchini and salt and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add wine and water and simmer, covered, until zucchini is very tender, about 10 minutes.
Purée mixture in a blender with parsley leaves until smooth (use caution when blending hot liquids). Season with salt and pepper. If desired, pour through a fine-mesh sieve into cleaned saucepan, pressing hard on solids, then discarding them. Reheat if necessary.

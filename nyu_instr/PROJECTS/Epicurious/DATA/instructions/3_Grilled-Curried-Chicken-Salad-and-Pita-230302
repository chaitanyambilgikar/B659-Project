Preheat grill or broiler. Remove excess fat from chicken and pound breast halves between sheets of waxed paper to 1/2-inch thickness. Grill or broil chicken 3 to 5 minutes on each side or until juices run clear when pierced with a fork. Cool. Cut into 1/2-inch cubes and place in a medium bowl. Add mayonnaise, yogurt, apple, grapes, red onion, apple juice, parsley, curry powder, salt, and pepper. Mix. Heat pita in warm oven and serve with chicken salad, lettuce and tomato slices.

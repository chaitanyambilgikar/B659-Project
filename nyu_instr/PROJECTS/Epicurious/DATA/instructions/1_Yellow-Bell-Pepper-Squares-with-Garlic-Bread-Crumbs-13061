In a large heavy non-stick skillet heat oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and sauté bell peppers with salt and pepper to taste, stirring occasionally, until just tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and bread crumbs and cook, stirring, 5 minutes, until bread crumbs are browned and bell peppers are very tender.
Serve warm or at room temperature.

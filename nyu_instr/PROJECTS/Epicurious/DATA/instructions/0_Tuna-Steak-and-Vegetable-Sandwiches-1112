Preheat broiler. Combine 3/4 cup oil and next 3 ingredients in small bowl. Arrange eggplant slices, zucchini and bell pepper on broiler pan. Brush on both sides with oil mixture. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Broil until brown, watching closely, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to platter. Place bread on broiler pan. Brush top side with oil mixture and sprinkle with pepper. Broil until top side is brown. Transfer to work surface, browned side up.
Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over high heat. Season tuna with salt and pepper. Add to skillet and sauté until just cooked through, about 30 seconds per side.

Peel and pit mangoes, then purée in a food processor until smooth (you should have 2 1/3 cups purée). Force through a medium-mesh sieve into a bowl to remove any fibers, scraping bottom of sieve with a rubber spatula (discard fibers).
Sprinkle gelatin over 1/4 cup water in a small bowl and let stand 1 minute to soften. Heat sugar and remaining cup water in a small saucepan over moderately high heat, stirring, until sugar is dissolved, then add gelatin mixture and stir until dissolved. Add puréed mango and heat, stirring, just until mixture reaches a bare simmer. Remove from heat, then stir in evaporated milk until combined well. Cool to room temperature, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes.
Divide among 8 (1/2-cup) goblets and chill, covered, at least 8 hours and up to 24 (for flavors to develop; puddings will be softly set).

Rinse cockles in a colander under cold running water.
Bring water to a boil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over high heat, then add Sherry, ginger, cilantro stems, scallions, and sea salt and return to a boil. Add cockles and cook, covered, until shells open wide, 3 to 5 minutes. (Discard any cockles that remain unopened after 5 minutes.)
Divide cockles among 6 bowls using tongs or a slotted spoon, then ladle out broth into a fine-mesh sieve lined with a paper towel set over a bowl, working from top, leaving any silt in bottom of skillet. Ladle strained broth into bowls of cockles and top with cilantro leaves.

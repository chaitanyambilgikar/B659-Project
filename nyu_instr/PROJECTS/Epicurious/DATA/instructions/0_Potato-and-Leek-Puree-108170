1. In a large pot with water just to cover, boil the potatoes and leeks forabout 30 minutes, until the potatoes are tender and easily pierced with the tip of a knife. Drain, reserving the water, and remove the potatoes. Pass them through a ricer. Set aside.
2. Transfer the leeks to a food processor fitted with a steel blade and purée.
3. Melt the butter in a heavy saucepan over medium heat. Add the riced potatoes. Gradually stir in the milk, beating with a wooden spoon until creamy. Stir in the puréed leeks. Stir in some of the reserved potato water for a more liquid consistency.
4. Serve immediately. Freeze leftover purée that won't be eaten the next day.

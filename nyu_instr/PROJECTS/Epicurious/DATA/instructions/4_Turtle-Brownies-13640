Preheat oven to 350°F. and butter and flour a 9-inch square baking pan, knocking out excess flour.
Make brownie layer: In a heavy 1 1/2-quart saucepan melt chocolate and butter over low heat, stirring, until smooth and remove pan from heat. Cool mixture to lukewarm and stir in brown sugar and vanilla. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well with a wooden spoon until mixture is glossy and smooth. In a bowl sift together flour, baking powder, and salt and add to chocolate mixture, beating just until batter is combined well.
Spread batter evenly in pan and bake in middle of oven 30 to 35 minutes, or until a tester comes out clean. Cool brownie layer completely in pan on a rack.
Make caramel-pecan layer: In a heavy 3-quart saucepan bring sugar, corn syrup, water, and a pinch salt to a boil over moderate heat, stirring until sugar is dissolved, and boil mixture, without stirring, until it turns a golden caramel. Remove pan from heat and carefully add cream and vanilla (mixture will bubble up and steam). Stir in pecans and quickly pour mixture over brownie layer, spreading evenly. Cool brownies completely in pan on a rack.
Make garnish: In a double boiler or metal bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water melt chocolate, stirring, until smooth and remove top of double boiler or bowl from heat. Transfer chocolate to a small sealable plastic bag. Squeeze chocolate into one corner of bag and with a sharp knife cut a tiny slice off corner to form a small hole. Squeeze chocolate decoratively over brownies.
Chill brownies, loosely covered, until caramel is firm, at least 4 hours.
Cut chilled brownies into 16 squares and remove from pan while still cold. Let brownies come to room temperature before eating. Brownies keep, covered and chilled in one layer, 5 days.

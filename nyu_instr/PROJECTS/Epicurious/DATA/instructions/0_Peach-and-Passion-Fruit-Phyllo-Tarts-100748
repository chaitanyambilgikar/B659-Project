Make shells: Preheat oven to 425°F.
Stack phyllo between 2 sheets of wax paper and cover with a kitchen towel. In a very small saucepan melt butter. On a work surface brush 1 phyllo sheet with half of melted butter. Top buttered phyllo with a second phyllo sheet and brush with remaining butter. Sprinkle amaretti crumbs evenly over second phyllo sheet and top with remaining phyllo sheet. Cut phyllo stack into quarters and fit 1 quarter into each of four 3-inch tart pans with removable fluted rims. Fold in pastry overhang to form a shallow crumpled edge.
Bake shells on a baking sheet in middle of oven until golden, about 15 minutes, and cool in pans on a rack. Shells may be made 1 day ahead and kept in tart pans, loosely covered, in a cool, dry place.
Make filling: Line a sieve with a double thickness of cheesecloth or a paper towel and set over a bowl. Drain yogurt in sieve, covered and chilled, at least 1 hour. Discard liquid and transfer yogurt to a bowl. Stir in sugar.
Halve and pit peaches and cut into 1/2-inch-thick wedges. Transfer wedges to a small bowl. Halve passion fruit and scoop flesh and seeds into bowl. Stir in honey until combined well. Fruit mixture may be made 2 hours ahead and kept chilled, covered.
Assemble: Just before serving, remove shells from pans and divide yogurt among shells, smoothing tops. Top yogurt with fruit mixture.

Heat milk, sugar, cocoa powder, corn syrup, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a 2-quart heavy saucepan, stirring, until sugar has dissolved. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla. Cool to room temperature or quick-chill in an ice bath. Pour into molds and freeze 30 minutes. Insert sticks (if using), then freeze until firm, about 24 hours.
Run hot water over molds (or dip in hot water) to loosen pops before unmolding.

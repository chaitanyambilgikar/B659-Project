Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 375°F. Line a 9-inch square baking pan with foil, leaving a 2-inch overhang, then butter and flour foil (except overhang).
Whisk together flour, cinnamon, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Add dates, almonds, and sesame seeds and toss until combined. Whisk together butter, brown sugar, eggs, and vanilla, then stir into date mixture until combined well.
Spread batter evenly in baking pan. Bake until golden and edges begin to pull away from sides of pan, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool completely in pan before cutting into bars.

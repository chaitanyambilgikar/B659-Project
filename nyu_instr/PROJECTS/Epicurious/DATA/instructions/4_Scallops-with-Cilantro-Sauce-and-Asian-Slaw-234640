Toss together carrot, radish, apple, scallion, vinegar, 1 tablespoon sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a bowl. Let stand, tossing occasionally, 15 minutes to soften.
Stir together cilantro, lime juice, chile, fish sauce, 3 tablespoons oil, and remaining 1/2 tablespoon sugar, or to taste.
Pat scallops dry. Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. Heat remaining tablespoon oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, and sauté scallops, turning over once, until golden and just cooked through, about 4 minutes total.
Drain slaw, discarding liquid. Divide among 6 plates and top with scallops. Drizzle with cilantro sauce.

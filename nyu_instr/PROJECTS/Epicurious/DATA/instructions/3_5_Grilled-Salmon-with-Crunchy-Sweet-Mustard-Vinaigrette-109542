Vinaigrette: Whisk the vinegar, mustard, and shallot together in a medium bowl. Gradually whisk in the honey, then the oil, until the dressing is emulsified. Season to taste with salt and pepper. (The vinaigrette can be made a few hours in advance, covered, and kept refrigerated. Bring to room temperature and whisk or shake well before serving.)
Salmon: 1. Heat your grill to high.
2. Brush the fish on both sides with oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill the salmon skin side down until the skin is lightly charred and crisp, 4 to 5 minutes. Turn the fillets over, reduce the heat to medium or move to a cooler part of the grill, and cook until just cooked through but not falling apart, 2 to 3 minutes more.
3. Remove the fish to serving plates or a platter and spoon a few tablespoons of vinaigrette over each fillet. Serve immediately.

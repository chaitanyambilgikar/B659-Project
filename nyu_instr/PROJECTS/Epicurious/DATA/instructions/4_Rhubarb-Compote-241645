Combine wine, sugar, orange peel, and lemon peel in heavy large saucepan. Bring to boil, stirring until sugar dissolves. Add rhubarb and salt and simmer until rhubarb is tender but still retains its shape, about 9 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer rhubarb to shallow dish, arranging in single layer. Boil wine syrup in saucepan until slightly thickened and reduced to 1 1/4 cups, adding any juices accumulated from rhubarb, about 5 minutes. Pour syrup over rhubarb and cool, then cover and chill until cold. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and keep chilled.

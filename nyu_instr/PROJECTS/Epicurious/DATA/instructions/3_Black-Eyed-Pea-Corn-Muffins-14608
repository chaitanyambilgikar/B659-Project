Quick-soak black-eyed peas. In a saucepan simmer peas in water to cover until tender, about 20 minutes, and drain in a sieve.
Preheat oven to 425°F. and butter twelve 1/3-cup muffin cups.
In a bowl whisk together cornmeal, Cheddar, flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Melt butter. Wearing rubber gloves, seed and mince jalapeños. In a small bowl whisk together butter, jalapeños, milk, and egg. Stir butter mixture, peas, and parsley into cornmeal mixture until just combined (do not overblend).
Divide batter among muffin cups and bake in middle of oven 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden and a tester comes out clean.

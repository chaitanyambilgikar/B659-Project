In a heavy saucepan bring the cream to a boil with the butter, add the brown sugar, and simmer the mixture, stirring, until the brown sugar is dissolved. Add the chocolate and the salt and heat the mixture over low heat, whisking, until the chocolate is melted and the sauce is smooth. Stir in the peppermint candy and serve the sauce warm over ice cream.

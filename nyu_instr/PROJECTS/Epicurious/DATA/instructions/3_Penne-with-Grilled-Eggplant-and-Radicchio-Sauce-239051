Cut eggplants in half lengthwise, then cut crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Place on layers of paper towels. Sprinkle eggplant lightly with salt; let stand 30 minutes.
Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Pat eggplant dry. Brush eggplant and radicchio with 3 tablespoons oil; sprinkle with salt. Grill until eggplant is tender and radicchio is wilted, about 4 minutes per side for eggplant and 1 minute per side for radicchio. Transfer radicchio to cutting board; chop coarsely.
Heat 3 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; stir 2 minutes. Add parsley and thyme. Reduce heat to low; sauté until onion is soft, about 10 minutes. Add next 5 ingredients; simmer 8 minutes, stirring frequently. Stir in eggplant and radicchio. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Toss pasta with 1 tablespoon oil in large bowl. Add eggplant sauce and toss. Sprinkle with crumbled goat cheese; serve.

In a large heavy saucepan combine sugars, vinegar, water, and spices and boil, stirring, until sugars are dissolved. Add maple syrup, orange and lemon slices, and prunes and simmer, covered, until prunes are plump and very tender, about 25 minutes. Transfer prunes with a slotted spoon to a bowl and boil syrup until thickened and reduced to about 1 1/2 cups, 15 to 20 minutes. With a slotted spoon remove spices, orange, and lemon and discard.
With a small knife cut a slit in side of each prune and stuff with a pecan half. Divide stuffed prunes among 3 clean 12-ounce jars and pour enough hot syrup into each jar to just cover prunes. Add 2 tablespoons rum to each jar and cover tightly, turning jars a few times to distribute rum. Prunes keep, covered and chilled, 1 month.

Cut tomato into 1/4-inch dice and transfer to a small bowl. In another small bowl whisk together lemon juice, oil, and salt and pepper to taste.
In a food processor finely chop mint and parsley. Replace chopping blade with shredding disk and shred zucchini over herbs. Transfer mixture to a large bowl. Drizzle three fourths vinaigrette over zucchini and toss with salt and pepper to taste. Pour off any juices from diced tomato and toss tomato with remaining vinaigrette and salt and pepper to taste. Divide zucchini salad among 4 plates, mounding it, and make an indentation in center of each mound. Fill indentations with tomatoes and garnish with mint.

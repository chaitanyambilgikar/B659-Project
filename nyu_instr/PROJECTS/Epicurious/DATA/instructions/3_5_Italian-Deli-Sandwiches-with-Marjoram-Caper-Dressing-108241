Blend olive oil, parsley, capers, 3 tablespoons marjoram, and vinegar in food processor until herbs are finely chopped. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer dressing to small bowl. Let stand 30 minutes.
Mix remaining 1 tablespoon marjoram into dressing. Spoon dressing over cut sides of bread, dividing equally. Arrange meats, cheeses, and onion on bottom half of bread. Cover with top half of bread. Cut diagonally into 4 sandwiches. (Sandwiches can be made 4 hours ahead. Wrap tightly in foil and refrigerate.)

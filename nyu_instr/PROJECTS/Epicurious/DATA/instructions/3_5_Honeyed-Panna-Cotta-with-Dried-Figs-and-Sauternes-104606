Place milk in heavy small saucepan. Sprinkle gelatin over. Let stand 5 minutes to soften. Stir over medium heat until gelatin dissolves, about 5 minutes (do not boil). Add cream, 3 tablespoons sugar, honey and salt and stir until sugar dissolves, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Whisk in vanilla. Cool slightly. Strain into 8 wineglasses. Refrigerate until set, at least 5 hours. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and keep refrigerated.)
Combine Sauternes, figs and 1 tablespoon sugar in heavy medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Boil until mixture is reduced to 3/4 cup, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat. Cool completely. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
Spoon some figs and cooking liquid atop each panna cotta and serve.
*A California dessert wine made with Orange Muscat grapes; available at liquor stores and some supermarkets.

Preheat oven to 200°F. Line 2 large baking sheets with foil; butter foil. Beat whites and cream of tartar in large bowl to soft peaks. Add 1 cup sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating until stiff and glossy. Add 4 tablespoons ginger, cornstarch and cardamom; beat 1 minute.
Spoon meringue into pastry bag fitted with plain 1/2-inch round tip. Pipe 3 1/2-inch-diameter meringue ring on prepared sheet. Pipe another ring atop first. Pipe meringue inside ring to create thin base, covering bottom of ring completely. Repeat, forming 6 meringue shells total.
Bake meringues 1 1/2 hours (they will not color). Turn oven off. Leave meringues in closed oven 1 1/2 hours longer. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Store between layers of waxed paper in airtight container.)
Slice 1 1/2 mangoes; chill. Puree remaining 1 1/2 mangoes in processor with 1 tablespoon sugar. Mix in enough water to thin to sauce consistency. (Can be made 6 hours ahead. Chill.)
Beat cream, sour cream, vanilla and 1 tablespoon sugar in large bowl to stiff peaks. Drizzle 1/4 cup mango sauce onto each of 6 plates. Place 1 meringue on each plate. Spoon 1/3 cup cream into center of each meringue. Top with pineapple, kiwi and sliced mango. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon ginger.

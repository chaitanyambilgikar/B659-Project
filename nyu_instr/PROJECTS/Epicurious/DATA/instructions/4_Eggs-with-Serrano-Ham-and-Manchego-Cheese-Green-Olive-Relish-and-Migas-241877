For relish: Combine all ingredients in small bowl. DO AHEAD: Relish can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.
For migas: Preheat oven to 375°F. Stir olive oil and garlic in large bowl. Add bread cubes and toss to coat well. Transfer bread to heavy large baking sheet and bake until lightly toasted yet still chewy, about 10 minutes. Cool.
For salad: Whisk olive oil, vinegar, and shallots in large bowl. Add arugula, frisée, and migas; toss well. Season lightly with fleur de sel. Divide salad among 4 plates.
For eggs: Heat olive oil in large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add eggs; immediately cover top of each egg with cheese, dividing evenly. Cover and cook until egg whites are just set and cheese softens, about 2 minutes. Carefully transfer 1 egg to each plate; top with ham and season with pepper. Top each egg with relish, dividing evenly.

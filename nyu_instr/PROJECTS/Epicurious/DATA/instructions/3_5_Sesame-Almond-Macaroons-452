Preheat oven to 325°F. Sprinkle sesame seeds on large baking sheet. Place in oven; toast until light golden, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes. Cool.
Line 2 heavy large baking sheets with foil. Butter and flour foil. Using electric mixer, beat almond paste and sugar until only very small pieces of almond paste remain. Add egg whites and mix on high speed until mixture is smooth, about 5 minutes. Mix in sesame seeds. Drop by rounded teaspoonfuls onto prepared baking sheets, spacing 2 inches apart.
Bake cookies until puffed, pale golden and edges begin to brown, about 14 minutes. Transfer foil with cookies to rack and cool completely. Carefully peel cookies from foil. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Store in airtight containers.)

Melt butter in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Pour all but 2 tablespoons melted butter into large bowl. Add mushrooms and garlic to 2 tablespoons butter remaining in skillet; sauté until mushrooms are tender, about 8 minutes. Cool to room temperature.
Position rack in bottom third of oven and preheat to 450°F. Brush two 9-inch-diameter cake pans with 1 1/2-inch-high sides with some of melted butter from bowl. Line bottom of pans with parchment paper; brush generously with melted butter. Add potatoes and minced thyme to bowl with remaining melted butter; toss gently to coat. Season potatoes generously with salt and pepper.
Arrange 1 layer of potato slices in bottom of each pan, overlapping slightly. Top each with second layer of potato slices. Top each with half of mushrooms. Cover each with remaining potatoes, dividing equally. Divide any remaining butter in bowl between pans.
Bake potatoes until tender and very brown and crisp on top (bottom will also be brown and crisp), about 40 minutes. (Can be made 6 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature. Rewarm potatoes in 350°F oven approximately 10 minutes.)
Invert galettes onto platters; peel off parchment. Cut galettes into wedges.

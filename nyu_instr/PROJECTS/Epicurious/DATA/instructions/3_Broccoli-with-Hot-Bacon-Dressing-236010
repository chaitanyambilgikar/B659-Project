Peel broccoli stems with a vegetable peeler, then cut crosswise into 1/4-inch slices.
Cook bacon in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until browned and crisp, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer bacon with a slotted spoon to several layers of paper towels to drain, leaving fat in skillet. Add garlic and raisins to skillet and cook over moderate heat, stirring, until garlic is pale golden, about 1 minute. Stir in vinegar, oil, salt, and pepper, then remove from heat.
Meanwhile, cook broccoli florets and stems in a large pot of boiling salted water until just tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain broccoli well and transfer to a bowl.
Bring dressing to a simmer, then cook, stirring, 1 minute. Pour hot dressing over broccoli and sprinkle with bacon, tossing to combine.

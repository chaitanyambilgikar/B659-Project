In a saucepan bring water and peas to a boil and simmer 20 minutes, or until tender. Drain peas in a colander and rinse under cold water to cool. Drain peas well and in a large bowl toss with remaining ingredients and salt and pepper to taste. (Salad may be made 2 hours ahead and chilled, covered.)

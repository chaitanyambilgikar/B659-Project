Bring 2 cups water to boil in heavy medium saucepan. Add rice. Reduce heat; cover and simmer until rice is tender and water is absorbed, about 50 minutes. (Rice can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
Mix milk into rice in heavy medium saucepan. Boil until mixture is thick, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium. Add sugar and orange peel and cook until flavors blend, stirring frequently, about 5 minutes longer. Remove saucepan from heat. Mix in vanilla extract. Spoon cereal into bowls.

Preheat oven to 375°F. Mix first 5 ingredients in large bowl. Combine 1 cup cream and sesame oil in small bowl. Mix into dry ingredients. Add enough additional cream by tablespoons to bind dough. Knead 30 seconds. Flatten dough into 1/2-inch-round. Cut out biscuits using 2 1/2-inch-diameter cookie cutter dipped into flour. Gather scraps and reform into round. Cut out additional biscuits. Transfer to baking sheet. Brush with egg glaze. Top with sesame seeds. Bake until biscuits rise and tops are brown, about 35 minutes. Cool slightly.

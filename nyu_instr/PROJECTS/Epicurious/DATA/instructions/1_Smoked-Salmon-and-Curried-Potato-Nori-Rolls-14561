Peel potatoes and cut into 1/2-inch cubes. In a large heavy saucepan cover potatoes with salted water by 1 inch and bring to a boil. Simmer potatoes until tender, about 5 minutes. Drain potatoes in a colander and cool slightly.While potatoes are cooling, in a small non-stick skillet heat oil over moderate heat until hot but not smoking and cook mustard seeds and curry powder until seeds begin to pop.
In a bowl combine warm potatoes, mustard-seed mixture, yogurt, parsley, and salt and pepper to taste and with a potato masher mash potatoes until almost smooth.
Peel and seed cucumber and cut into matchstick-thin strips. Cut salmon into 1/4-inch-wide strips. Put a sushi mat on a work surface with bamboo strips of mat parallel to front of work surface. On mat arrange 1 nori piece, shiny side down and with a long side lined up with near edge of mat, and spread 1/3 cup potato mixture evenly in a 2 1/2-inch-wide strip along near edge. Arrange one sixth of salmon and cucumber in a line along center of potato mixture and dampen far edge of nori with a moistened finger. Beginning with long side near you, roll up nori tightly, using mat as an aid to help tighten roll. Seal dampened edge and with a sharp knife cut roll crosswise into 6 pieces. Make 5 more rolls in same manner.

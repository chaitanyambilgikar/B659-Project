Place dried Great Northern beans in large pot. Pour enough cold water over beans to cover by 3 inches. Bring to boil. Boil 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Cover beans and let stand 1 hour. Drain. Return beans to same pot. Add 7 cups water and bay leaves; bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer 30 minutes. Add salt and pepper to beans; continue to simmer until beans are tender, about 30 minutes longer. Drain well. Transfer beans to large bowl.
Whisk olive oil and Sherry wine vinegar in small bowl. Add vinaigrette, anchovy fillets and chopped fresh parsley to warm beans and toss gently to blend. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Spoon onto plates and serve warm or at room temperature.

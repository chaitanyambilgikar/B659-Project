Cut salmon into bite-size cubes. Combine maple syrup and soy sauce in a medium-size bowl and add salmon, making sure the fish is fully immersed in the marinade. Cover and refrigerate for 24 hours.
Grease a sheet of aluminum foil with the oil (vegetable oil sprays work well). Preheat oven to 500°F. Put pepper in small bowl or plate and dip top of salmon pieces into pepper. Place each peppered piece on foil, then cook in oven for 3 to 4 minutes. Serve immediately.

Place whipping cream in heavy medium saucepan. Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add pod. Bring cream to simmer. Whisk egg yolks and sugar in medium metal bowl to blend. Gradually whisk in hot cream mixture. Return mixture to saucepan and stir over medium-low heat until custard thickens and finger leaves path when drawn across back of spoon, about 4 minutes (do not boil). Strain. Cover and refrigerate custard sauce until cold, about 3 hours. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Keep refrigerated.)

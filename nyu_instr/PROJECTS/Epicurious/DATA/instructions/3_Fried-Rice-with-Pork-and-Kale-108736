Heat oil in a wok or a deep 12-inch heavy nonstick skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking. Add garlic and ginger and stir-fry until golden, about 1 minute. Add onion and stir-fry until lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Add carrot and kale and stir-fry 2 minutes. Add rice, pork, and bean sprouts and stir-fry 1 minute.
Stir together lime juice, soy sauce, sugar, and chile until sugar is dissolved. Add soy mixture to wok, then add scallions and 1 tablespoon cilantro and stir-fry 1 minute. Add beaten egg (if using) and stir-fry until egg is set, about 1 minute. Serve sprinkled with remaining tablespoon cilantro.

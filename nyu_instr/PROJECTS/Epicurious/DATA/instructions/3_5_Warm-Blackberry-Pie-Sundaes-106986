Combine 4 cups blackberries, orange juice, sugar, orange peel, and cinnamon in medium saucepan. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to low; simmer until berries are soft and begin to release juices, about 8 minutes. Transfer 2 cups berry mixture to processor; puree until almost smooth. Return mixture to same saucepan. Stir in remaining blackberries. (Can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature. Rewarm berry mixture over medium heat until just warm before continuing.)
Divide cookie crumbs among 8 bowls or wineglasses. Add 1 scoop ice cream to each. Spoon warm blackberry sauce over each and serve.

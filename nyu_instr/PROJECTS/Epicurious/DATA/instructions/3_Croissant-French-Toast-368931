Whisk eggs, half-and-half, sugar, cinnamon, orange zest, and nutmeg in a large bowl to blend. Add croissants to egg mixture; turn to coat evenly on both sides.
Heat a griddle or large skillet over medium-low heat. Brush with melted butter. Lift croissants from batter, allowing excess to drip back into bowl. Cook croissants on griddle until browned on both sides and just cooked through, about 5 minutes per side. Place 2 halves on each plate. Serve croissants with warm syrup and fruit compote, if desired.

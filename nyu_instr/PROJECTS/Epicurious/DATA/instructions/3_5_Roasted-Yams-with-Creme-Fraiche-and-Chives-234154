Preheat oven to 350°F. Place yams in large bowl. Add oil, kosher salt, and pepper. Toss to coat. Transfer yams to rimmed baking sheet; drizzle with any remaining oil mixture. Bake until tender, about 45 minutes.
Using sharp knife, slit yams lengthwise down center. Press ends together, forcing potato open. Sprinkle each with fleur de sel. Spoon in dollop of crème fraîche, sprinkle with chives and pepper, and serve.

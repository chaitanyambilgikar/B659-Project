1. Put the bulgur in a medium bowl, add the warm water, and let soak for 30 minutes. Drain.
2. Transfer the bulgur to a food processor. Add all of the remaining ingredients except the oil and process until smooth. If the mixture is too thin, add a little more flour. Using floured hands, shape into oval patties about 2 inches long, 1 inch wide, and 1/2 inch thick, tapering the ends.
3. Heat 1/4 inch oil in a large skillet over medium heat. In batches, fry the patties, turning once, until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Serve warm or at room temperature.
Sephardic Pumpkin Patties (Fritadas de Calabaza): This batter is looser than the bulgur version and is dropped from a spoon. Omit the bulgur, the 1/2 cup cold water, the onion, garlic, coriander, pepper, allspice, cumin, and Aleppo pepper. Add 3 large eggs, 2 to 8 tablespoons granulated or packed brown sugar, 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg, and a pinch of ground ginger.
Syrian Baked Pumpkin Casserole (Kibbet Yatkeen bi Seniyeh): Spread the pumpkin mixture in an oiled 9-inch square baking pan. Cut into diamonds or 1 1/2-inch squares, drizzle with 1/4 cup vegetable oil, and bake in a preheated 375°F oven until golden brown, about 45 minutes.

Toast pine nuts: Place in a dry skillet over medium heat; stir occasionally until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Cool. Toss nuts, beef, lettuce, carrots, cucumber, onion and feta in a bowl. Slice off 1/4 of each pita; stuff larger piece with filling. Whisk mayonnaise, milk and vinegar in another bowl. Drizzle dressing over pita filling. Serve with remaining 1/4 pita.

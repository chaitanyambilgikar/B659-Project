For crust: Blend flour and salt in processor 5 seconds. Add butter and cut in, using on/ off turns, until very coarse meal forms. Add 3 tablespoons ice water. Blend until moist clumps form, adding more water by teaspoonfuls if dough is dry. Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk. Wrap in plastic. Chill at least 1 hour and up to 1 day.
Roll out dough on lightly floured surface to 12- to 13-inch round. Transfer to 9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom. Cut off all but 1/2-inch overhang. Fold overhang in and press so that sides of dough rise 1/4 to 1/3 inch above rim of pan. Freeze crust 15 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375°F. Line crust with foil; fill with dried beans or pie weights. Bake crust until sides are set, about 25 minutes. Remove foil and beans. Bake crust until pale golden, piercing with fork if crust bubbles, about 20 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350°F. Cool crust.
For filling: Melt butter in heavy medium skillet over medium heat. Add shallots. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Sauté until soft and beginning to color, about 4 minutes. Spread shallots in crust. Whisk cream, eggs, pepper, nutmeg, and salt in medium bowl. Mix in cheese. Pour custard into crust. Bake until filling is set in center, 35 to 38 minutes. Transfer tart to rack and cool 15 to 30 minutes. Push up pan bottom, releasing tart. Serve tart warm or at room temperature.

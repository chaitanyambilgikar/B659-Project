Combine rice and 2 cups water in heavy medium saucepan. Bring to boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer until rice is tender, about 18 minutes. Drain if necessary. Let cool slightly.
Preheat oven to 400°F. Combine pears, lemon juice, 3 tablespoons sugar and peel in large bowl; toss to blend. Stir in rice. Transfer mixture to 9-inch-diameter glass pie dish, spreading evenly. Sprinkle with nutmeg and 1 tablespoon sugar. Bake until heated through, about 15 minutes. Spoon warm pudding into bowls.

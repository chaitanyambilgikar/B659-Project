1. Preheat the oven to 250°F. Season the veal with salt and white pepper. Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the veal; brown well on all sides. Transfer to a plate.
2. Add the next nine ingredients to the pan and cook, stirring, until the onion begins to brown. Add the cabbage; cook until wilted and browned slightly. Add 1 cup each of the wine and cider. Return veal to the pot. Season with salt, cover and braise in the oven until the meat is very tender, about 2 1/2 to 3 hours.
3. Remove the veal and vegetables from the juices and keep warm. Strain and degrease juices; return to the pot. Add remaining wine and cider; bring to a boil. Reduce for 15 minutes to thicken. Adjust seasonings. Return veal to the pot; simmer, basting with sauce until it is syrupy and the meat is nicely glazed.
4. To serve, place vegetables on a platter; slice veal through the bones and place atop. Spoon sauce over all and sprinkle with chives.

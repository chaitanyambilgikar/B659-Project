Divide lemon juice, Tabasco, and drumsticks between 2 large sealable plastic bags and seal bags. Shake bags to coat drumsticks with Tabasco mixture. Chill drumsticks in one layer, turning bags occasionally, 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 425° F. and grease 2 large shallow baking pans.
Make coating: In a small saucepan melt butter. Finely chop parsley and in a bowl stir together with remaining coating ingredients.
Drain drumsticks in a colander and arrange, without crowding, in baking pans. Brush each drumstick on all sides with melted butter and roll in coating, pressing crumbs gently to adhere and returning to pan.
Bake drumsticks in upper and lower thirds of oven, switching position of pans halfway through baking, 40 minutes total, or until cooked through and golden brown. Drumsticks may be made 1 day ahead and cooled before being chilled in an airtight container.
Serve drumsticks hot or at room temperature.

Make dip: In small bowl, stir together sour cream, parsley, sugar, lime juice, salt, and pepper. (Dip can be prepared ahead and refrigerated, covered, up to 24 hours.)
Make poppers: Line colander with clean kitchen towel or triple layer paper towels.
In food processor, coarsely grate zucchini. (There should be about 3 cups.) Transfer to prepared colander. Wrap towel around zucchini, squeezing out as much liquid as possible. Transfer to medium bowl, then stir in egg and egg yolk, flour, Parmesan, sage, and garlic. Using hands, roll mixture into ¾-inch-diameter balls.
In heavy large skillet over moderately high heat, heat 1/4-inch oil until hot but not smoking. Working in batches of 5, drop balls into oil and, using slotted spatula, flatten each ball to approximately 1 inch round.
Fry poppers, turning once, until golden brown, 2 to 2½ minutes per side, then transfer to paper towels to drain. Serve warm or at room temperature with sour cream dip. (Poppers are best served right after frying, but can be prepared ahead and kept at room temperature up to 2 hours. If desired, rewarm in 350°F oven, turning once, 10 minutes.)

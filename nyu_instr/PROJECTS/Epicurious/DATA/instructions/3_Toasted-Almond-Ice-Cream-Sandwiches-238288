Preheat oven to 400°F. Line baking sheet with parchment paper. Cut pastry into thirds lengthwise along folds, then cut each strip crosswise into 4 pieces. Arrange squares on prepared sheet, spacing apart. Whisk sugar, cinnamon, and espresso powder in medium bowl. Add almonds and egg white; stir to coat. Spread almond mixture atop squares, dividing evenly.
Bake pastry squares until tops are golden around edges, 18 to 20 minutes. Cool completely. Using serrated knife, cut each piece horizontally in half. Spread 1/3 cup ice cream over each pastry bottom, then press on top to adhere. Freeze until ice cream is hard, about 1 hour.

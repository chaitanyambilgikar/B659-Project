In a small saucepan, bring onions, vinegar, and salt to a boil, covered, and remove pan from heat. Cool onion mixture, uncovered, and drain.
Bring a kettle of salted water to a boil for broccoli. Cut broccoli into 2 1/2-inch flowerets and cut remaining stems into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Blanch flowerets 3 minutes and drain well in a colander.
In a large skillet heat 2 tablespoons oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and sauté half of flowerets and stems with salt to taste, stirring occasionally, until crisp-tender, 3 to 5 minutes, transferring to a bowl. Sauté remaining flowerets and stems in remaining 2 tablespoons oil in same manner. Sprinkle broccoli with pickled red onions.

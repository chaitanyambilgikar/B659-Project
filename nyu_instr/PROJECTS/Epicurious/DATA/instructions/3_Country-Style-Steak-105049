Place the steak in a casserole dish and generously sprinkle with Worcestershire sauce. Cover and marinate overnight. Remove from the marinade and sprinkle generously with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Dip the steak in flour and shake. Heat the oil and quickly fry the steak until brown, but do not cook the inside too much. This is done by cooking both sides on high heat, turning quickly, and then reducing heat to low to finish cooking.
Boil 1/2 cup minced onion in another pot with 1/4 cup of the water for about 5 minutes. When finished cooking as many steaks as desired, leave about 3 tablespoons browned crumbs (not burned) and drippings from steak in skillet. Add onion and 3 tablespoons flour. Stir until slightly browned. Slowly pour in the remaining 3 cups hot water as it thickens. Season with salt and pepper to taste. The gravy may be served over rice or steaks.

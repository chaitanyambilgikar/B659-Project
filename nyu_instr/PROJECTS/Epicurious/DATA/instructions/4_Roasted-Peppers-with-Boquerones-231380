Preheat broiler.
Broil bell peppers on a broiler pan about 5 inches from heat, turning occasionally with tongs, until skins are blackened, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl and cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap, then let steam 20 minutes.
When peppers are cool enough to handle, peel them, reserving all juices in bowl, and discard stems and seeds. Cut peppers lengthwise into 1/4-inch-wide strips. Pour pepper juices through a sieve into another bowl, then add vinegar and sugar to juices, stirring until sugar is dissolved, then stir in peppers. Marinate peppers at room temperature, stirring occasionally, at least 2 hours.
Spoon peppers and juices into a shallow bowl and arrange anchovy strips decoratively on top.

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F.
2. Carefully loosen the skin of the chicken breast with your finger. Slip an herb sprig underneath each side of the breast, along with some garlic slices. Brush with olive oil and sprinkle with salt, pepper and paprika.
3. Place the breast in a small baking dish; add the chicken broth. Bake, basting occasionally, until golden and cooked through, about 40 minutes.
4. To serve, cut the breast in half lengthwise and place on two plates. Reheat the pan juices slightly over high heat; scrape up any brown bits from the pan bottom and spoon over chicken. Sprinkle with parsley and serve immediately.

Mix cream cheese, lemon juice and zest. Season with salt and pepper. Dollop a small spoonful of cream cheese mixture on each bagel chip. Gently roll salmon pieces into loose cylinders and lightly pinch together at the bottom to create a rose shape. Place salmon pieces, pinched side down, on top of chips; sprinkle with capers. Arrange chips on a platter and garnish with greens.

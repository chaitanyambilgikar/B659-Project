Rinse the lentils and cull them for small stones and debris. Put them in a heavy 4-quart pot with a tight-fitting lid. Cut thick sausages into 1-inch lengths or thin ones into 2-inch lengths, and put them in the pot. Clean and thinly slice the celery, chop the leaves, peel and finely chop the onion, and add it all to the pot.
Pour in the water, and add the salt and a few grindings of black pepper. Stir all the ingredients together, cover, and bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally.
Reduce the heat and cook at a lively simmer for about 1 hour, stirring from time to time to prevent the lentils from burning. When the sausages and lentils are cooked and the liquid has thickened, serve piping hot in bowls.

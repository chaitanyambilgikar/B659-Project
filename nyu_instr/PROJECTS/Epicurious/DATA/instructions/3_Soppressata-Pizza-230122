In a bowl, mix Romano and fontina. Make pizza crust. While second side of each crust is grilling, spread 1/8 cheese mixture over cooked side of each crust. Top with 1/8 peppers. Dollop 1/8 cup ricotta over each crust. Arrange 5 slices soppressata on each pizza. Sprinkle each with 1 1/2 tsp parsley. Rotate 3 to 4 minutes until bottom is evenly golden brown.

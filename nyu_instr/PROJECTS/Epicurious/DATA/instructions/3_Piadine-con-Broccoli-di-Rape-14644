Make dough: In a food processor pulse flour, salt, and baking powder until combined. Add water and oil and blend dough until smooth and elastic, about 1 minute. On a lightly floured surface knead dough 1 minute. Form dough into a ball and cover with an inverted bowl. Let dough stand at room temperature at least 20 minutes and up to 1 hour. Dough may be made 1 day ahead and chilled in a sealable plastic bag. Bring dough to room temperature before proceeding.
Make filling while dough is standing: Discard hollow stems from broccoli rabe and cut into 2-inch pieces. In a large saucepan of boiling salted water cook broccoli rabe 5 minutes, or until almost tender. Drain broccoli rabe in a colander.
Thinly slice garlic. In dried pan heat oil over moderately low heat until hot but not smoking and cook garlic, stirring, until golden. Stir in broccoli rabe, red pepper flakes, and coarse salt. Cover pan and cook 5 minutes, or until broccoli rabe is tender. Filling may be used hot or at room temperature.
Divide dough into 8 pieces. Cover all but 1 piece with inverted bowl. Form remaining piece into a ball and on a lightly floured surface with a lightly floured rolling pin roll out dough into an 8-inch round. Transfer round to a wax paper-lined plate and cover with another sheet of waxed paper. Roll out remaining dough pieces in same manner, layering them between sheets of wax paper.
Heat a griddle or well-seasoned (not non-stick) skillet over moderately high heat until a drop of water scatters and then evaporates immediately. Cook 1 dough round until it begins to firm up and turns golden, about 30 seconds (if round browns too quickly, reduce heat slightly). Turn round over and cook other side until golden. Wrap round in foil. Cook remaining dough rounds in same manner, wrapping in foil with first round. Piadine may be kept warm, wrapped well in foil, in a 250°F. oven 30 minutes.
To serve, fold piadine in half and fill with broccoli rabe.

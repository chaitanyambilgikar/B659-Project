In a 4-quart saucepan simmer beans, ham hock, yellow onion, garlic, cumin, water, and broth, partially covered, until beans are tender, about 1 hour. (Old beans may take longer to cook.) Transfer ham hock to a work surface and cool until it can be handled. Cut away ham and chop fine, discarding bone and fat.
Transfer 1 1/2 cups each beans and cooking liquid to a blender and let cool slightly. Purée mixture (use caution when blending hot liquids) and return to pan. Stir in ham, vinegar, sugar, and salt and pepper to taste and heat until hot.
Serve soup sprinkled with red onion.

Cook lima beans in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender, about 6 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in white corn. Drain well.
Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and stir until toasted, about 3 minutes. Add onion and sauté until translucent, about 8 minutes. Add bell peppers, chilies, garlic, and oregano; sauté until peppers are almost tender, about 4 minutes. Stir in lima beans and corn, then broth and cream. Simmer until vegetables are tender and coated with cream, about 20 minutes. Stir in 1/3 cup cilantro. Season succotash to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Stir over medium heat to rewarm.)
Transfer succotash to serving bowl; sprinkle with remaining 1/3 cup cilantro.
* Fresh green chilies, often called pasillas; available at Latin American markets and some supermarkets.

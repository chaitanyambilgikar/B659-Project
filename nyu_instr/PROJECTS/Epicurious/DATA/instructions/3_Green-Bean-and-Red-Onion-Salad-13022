On a steamer rack set over boiling water steam green beans, covered, until crisp-tender, about 4 minutes. Halve onion lengthwise and slice thin crosswise.
In a bowl whisk together vinegar, oil, and salt and pepper to taste until emulsified and add onion, tossing to combine. Add warm beans and toss to combine well.

Prepare grill.
In a bowl whisk together mustard, honey, garlic paste,lemon juice, jalapeño, and salt and pepper to taste and reserve 1 tablespoon of marinade in a small bowl for basting kebabs.
Add pork to marinade remaining in bowl. Toss pork pieces to coat well and marinate 15 minutes.
Thread pork onto two 10-inch metal skewers and grill on an oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals 4 minutes. Turn kebabs and baste with reserved marinade. Grill kebabs, turning and basting them, 10 to 15 minutes more, or until pork is cooked through and registers 160°F. on a meat thermometer. (Alternatively, kebabs may be grilled in a hot well-seasoned ridged grill pan over moderately high heat.)
Serve kebabs with couscous.
In a small heavy sauce, cook shallot or onion in butter over moderately low heat, stirring, until softened. Add water and bring to a boil.
Stir in couscous, zest and rosemary and cover pan. Remove pan from heat and let stand 5 minutes. Fluff couscous with a fork and stir in walnuts, lemon juice and salt and pepper to taste. Serves 2.

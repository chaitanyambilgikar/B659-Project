Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350°F.
Cut baguette with a serrated knife on a long diagonal into 3/4-inch-thick slices (about 5 to 6 inches long). Cut a lengthwise slit about 3 inches long from center through edge of a slice, then cross ends, overlapping them, to form a "claw." Repeat with remaining slices. Brush both sides of slices with oil and arrange in 1 layer on a large baking sheet, then sprinkle with sea salt.
Bake until crisp and golden, about 15 minutes. Cool on a rack.

Make dressing: Whisk together all dressing ingredients except oil in a small bowl. Add oil in a slow stream, whisking constantly until dressing is emulsified.
Make salad: Tear romaine, escarole, iceberg, and Boston lettuce into bite-size pieces and toss with endive in a large salad bowl (preferably wooden). Rub bread liberally all over with garlic and toss with greens. Add dressing, toss well, then discard bread. Serve immediately.

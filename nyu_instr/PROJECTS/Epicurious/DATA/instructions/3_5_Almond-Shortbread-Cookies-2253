Preheat oven to 375°F. Place 9-inch-diameter metal pie pan in freezer to chill. Combine butter, brown sugar, vanilla and salt in processor. Blend until smooth, about 20 seconds. Add flour and cornstarch. Using on/off turns, process until dough clumps together. Press dough evenly onto bottom of chilled pie pan. Sprinkle almonds over; press almonds lightly into dough to adhere. Freeze until chilled, about 5 minutes.
Bake shortbread until edges are golden brown, about 22 minutes. Transfer pan to rack. Cut warm shortbread into 8 wedges; cool completely in pan. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover; store at room temperature.)

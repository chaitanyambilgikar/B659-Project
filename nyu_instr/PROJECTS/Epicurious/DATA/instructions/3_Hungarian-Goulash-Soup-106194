Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium heat. Add onion and caraway seeds and sauté until onion begins to soften, about 8 minutes. Add beef and paprika; sauté until meat is brown on all sides, about 15 minutes. Add broth. Bring to boil, scraping up browned bits at bottom of pot. Reduce heat to low; simmer until meat is just tender, about 40 minutes.
Stir potato, parsnip, carrot, and garlic into soup. Simmer until vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes. Stir in tomatoes, celery, and bell pepper. Simmer until vegetables and meat are very tender, about 15 minutes longer. Cool slightly.
Transfer 3 1/2 cups soup to blender. Blend until smooth. Add to soup in pot. Stir in parsley. Season soup to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Cool slightly; chill uncovered until cold, then cover and refrigerate. Bring to simmer before serving.)
Ladle soup into 6 bowls. Top each with 1 tablespoon sour cream.

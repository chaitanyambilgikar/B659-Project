Make dressing: Pit and peel avocado and mash enough to measure 1/4 cup. In a blender purée mashed avocado with remaining dressing ingredients until smooth.
Discard any discolored lettuce leaves. Separately cut mushrooms and radishes into thin slices. In a small bowl combine mushrooms and 2 tablespoons dressing and toss to coat. Divide lettuce among 6 salad bowls or plates and top with mushrooms, radishes, and parsley. Drizzle salads with some remaining dressing.

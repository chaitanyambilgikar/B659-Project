In a small bowl sprinkle gelatin over water to soften 1 minute. In a saucepan combine cider and sugar and bring to a rolling boil. Boil mixture, skimming froth, until reduced to 2 cups. Stir in brandy and lemon juice and pour through a sieve lined with a double thickness of dampened cheesecloth or paper towel into a bowl. Stir gelatin mixture into hot cider mixture, stirring until gelatin is dissolved. Stir mixture well and divide among four 1/2-cup molds. Chill gelées until firm, at least 3 hours, and up to 2 days.
To unmold gelées, dip bottoms of molds, 1 at a time, into a bowl of hot water 3 seconds. Run a thin knife around edges of molds and invert gelées onto 4 small dessert plates.
Serve gelées with small bunches of grapes alongside.

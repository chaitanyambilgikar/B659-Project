Butter a 2 1/2-quart pudding dish or soufflè dish. Trim the crusts from the bread and butter the slices well. Arrange them in the dish, buttered side down, in layers. Sprinkle each layer with some of the raisins. Beat the eggs lightly and add the sugar, salt, half and half and vanilla. Pour through a strainer over the bread and let stand for 30 minutes. Cover with foil and bake in a 350°F. oven for 35 minutes. Remove the foil and continue baking until the pudding is lightly browned and set. This will take about 30-35 minutes. Serve warm with cream.

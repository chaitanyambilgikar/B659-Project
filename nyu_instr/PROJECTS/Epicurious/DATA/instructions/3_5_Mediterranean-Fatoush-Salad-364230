Prepare the matzo chips .
Slice the cucumbers in half lengthwise. With a spoon, scoop out and discard the pulp. Chop into 1/2-inch pieces. Place into a large salad bowl.
Thinly slice the endive and place into the bowl. Lay the mint leaves in a pile and tear them; they will bruise if you cut them with a knife. Add to the bowl. Toss in the parsley, tomatoes, and arugula. Mix in the lemon juice, olive oil, and garlic. Season with salt and pepper, tossing to combine. Allow to marinate for a few minutes.
Stand 2 matzo chips in each salad.

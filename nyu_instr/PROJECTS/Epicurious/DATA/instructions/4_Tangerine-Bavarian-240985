Remove side of springform pan and invert bottom, then reattach side (to make bavarian easier to remove). Lightly oil pan.
Grate enough zest from 1 tangerine to measure 1 teaspoon, then juice tangerines. (You will need 1 1/4 cups juice.)
Sprinkle gelatin over 1/4 cup tangerine juice in a small bowl and let stand about 5 minutes.
Whisk together yolks, sugar, lemon juice, and remaining cup tangerine juice in a heavy medium saucepan, then cook over medium-low heat, whisking constantly, until mixture just comes to a simmer (do not let boil). Remove from heat, then whisk in gelatin mixture until completely dissolved. Transfer to a metal bowl and chill in an ice bath, stirring frequently, until mixture has thickened to consistency of raw egg whites. Remove from ice bath.
Meanwhile, beat cream with zest until it just holds soft peaks.
Stir one third of whipped cream into yolk mixture to lighten, then fold in remaining cream gently but thoroughly. Spoon into springform pan and chill until set, at least 4 hours and up to 24.

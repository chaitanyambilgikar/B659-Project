Combine first 6 ingredients in a bowl, cover and refrigerate. Coat a mixing bowl with cooking spray. Pulse almonds in a food processor until they resemble breadcrumbs. Empty into prepared bowl. Pulse dates with 1 tsp water in food processor until well chopped (they will be a little clumpy). Mix with almonds to form a paste. Divide mixture evenly into 4 golf ballsized rounds. Place each ball between 2 pieces of wax paper and press to form a 4-inch crust. Turn up edges if desired. Refrigerate 2 hours. Use a spatula to move crusts to serving plates; fill each with 1/2 cup berries and drizzle each with some leftover juices from bowl. Top with julienned orange zest.

Preheat oven to 400°F.
Peel beets and cut into 3/4-inch wedges. In a bowl toss beets with 1 teaspoon oil to coat and in one end of a shallow baking pan spread in one layer.
Cut potatoes into 3/4-inch-thick slices. In another bowl toss potatoes with 1 teaspoon oil to coat and at other end of baking pan spread in one layer, making sure that potatoes do not touch beets (beets will bleed).
Cut zucchini diagonally into 1/2-inch-thick slices and cut slices lengthwise into 1/2-inch-wide sticks. In a bowl toss zucchini with 1 teaspoon oil to coat and in one end of another shallow baking pan spread in one layer.
Cut carrots diagonally into 1/3-inch-thick slices. In a bowl toss carrots with 1 teaspoon oil to coat and at the other end of second baking pan spread in one layer.
In a small bowl whisk together lemon juice, parsley, remaining 1/3 cup oil, and salt to taste.
Bake vegetables in oven 5 minutes, or until zucchini is just tender, and transfer zucchini to a shallow bowl. Bake remaining vegetables, testing them every 5 minutes, 10 to 15 minutes more, or until tender, and transfer as cooked to separate shallow bowls.
Stir dressing and spoon about 1 tablespoon over each vegetable, tossing to coat. In a bowl toss chicken with remaining dressing.
Arrange vegetables and salad greens on a platter and mound chicken in middle. Alternatively, vegetables, chicken, and dressing may be tossed together, but beets will bleed. Serve salad at room temperature.

Stir together flour, salt, and pepper in a shallow bowl. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 6-quart wide heavy pot over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking.
While oil is heating, dredge one third of beef in flour, shaking off excess, then brown on all sides, about 6 minutes total. Transfer with a slotted spoon to a bowl. Dredge and brown remaining meat in 2 batches in same manner, adding 1 tablespoon oil per batch and transferring beef as cooked with slotted spoon to bowl.
Add remaining tablespoon oil to pot and sauté garlic, onions, and bell peppers, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 12 minutes.
Whisk together tomato paste and water in a small bowl.
Add tomatoes with reserved juice to onion mixture along with tomato paste mixture, bay leaf, Tabasco, and sugar. Bring to a boil and add beef, then reduce heat and simmer, covered, stirring occasionally, until meat is very tender, about 1 1/2 hours.
Stir in rum and olives and simmer, uncovered, 10 minutes, then season with salt and pepper. Discard bay leaf.

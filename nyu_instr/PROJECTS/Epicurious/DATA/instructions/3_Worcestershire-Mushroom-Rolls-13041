In a food processor mince mushrooms in 2 batches. In a 10-inch non-stick skillet cook shallots in 2 tablespoons butter over moderate heat, stirring, until golden. Add mushrooms with salt to taste and cook over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until dark brown and very dry, about 15 minutes.
Add Worcestershire sauce and simmer, stirring occasionally, until sauce is evaporated and mixture is very dry, about 5 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and stir in Cheddar. (Filling may be made 3 days ahead and chilled, covered.)
Discard crusts from bread and with a rolling pin flatten each slice into a rectangle. In a small saucepan melt remaining 3 tablespoons butter.
On a work surface arrange a bread slice with a long side facing you and mound a level tablespoon filling along long side. Roll up bread jelly-roll fashion. Arrange roll, seam side down, in a shallow baking pan. Make more rolls with remaining bread and filling in same manner, arranging in pan in one layer, touching each other, and keeping covered with plastic wrap.
Brush mushroom rolls all over with melted butter and rearrange, seam sides down and barely touching, in pan. Chill mushrooms rolls, covered, at least 1 hour and up to 1 day.
Preheat oven to 425°F.
Bake mushroom rolls in upper third of oven 15 minutes, or until golden. Halve rolls crosswise and tie a chive around each half.

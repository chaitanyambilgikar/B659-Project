Make dressing: In a small saucepan boil cider or juice until reduced to about 3 tablespoons, about 15 minutes. Cool cider or juice slightly and in a bowl whisk together with yogurt, parsley, and dill. Dressing may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.
Make salad: Halve cabbage lengthwise and with a mandoline or sharp knife cut crosswise into very thin shreds. Trim fennel stalks flush with bulb, discarding stalks, and cut fennel and cucumber into 1/4-inch dice. Vegetables may be prepared up to this point 4 hours ahead and chilled separately, covered.
Just before serving, cut apples into julienne strips and transfer with vegetables to a large bowl. Toss salad with dressing.

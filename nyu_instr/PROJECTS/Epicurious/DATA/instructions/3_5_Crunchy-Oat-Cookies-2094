Preheat oven to 350°F. Using electric mixer, cream shortening, butter and sugar until fluffy. Blend in egg, vinegar, baking soda and salt. Mix in oats, then flour. Form dough into 1 1/2-inch balls. Space balls 2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheets. Dip flat-bottom glass into sugar. Press glass onto dough ball and flatten into 1/3-inch-thick cookie. Repeat with remaining dough balls. Bake until just golden brown on edges, about 16 minutes. Transfer to racks and cool completely. (Can be prepared 4 days ahead. Store cookies in airtight container.)

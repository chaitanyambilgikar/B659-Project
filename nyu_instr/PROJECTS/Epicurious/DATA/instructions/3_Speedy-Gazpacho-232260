Working in 2 batches and using on/off turns, finely chop cucumber and bell pepper in processor. Add 2 cups tomato juice and remaining ingredients; blend to coarse puree. Season to taste with salt. Transfer to bowl. Cover and chill 2 hours for flavors to develop. Mix in more tomato juice by 1/4 cupfuls if too spicy.

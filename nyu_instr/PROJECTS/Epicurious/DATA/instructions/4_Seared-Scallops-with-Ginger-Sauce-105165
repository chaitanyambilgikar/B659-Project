Melt 2 tablespoons butter with oil in heavy large skillet over high heat. Sprinkle scallops with salt and pepper. Add 12 scallops to skillet and sear until brown, about 1 minute per side; transfer to bowl. Sear remaining 12 scallops; transfer to same bowl. Add ginger and garlic to skillet and sauté until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add wine and vinegar and boil 2 minutes, scraping up any browned bits. Add cream and remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Boil until sauce thickens enough to coat spoon, about 3 minutes. Return scallops and any collected juices to skillet. Simmer until scallops are just opaque in center, about 2 minutes. Mix in cilantro and green onion.

Put the pieces of chocolate in an absolutely dry heatproof bowl. Set the bowl over a saucepan of simmering water to melt the chocolate, stirring until smooth. In the meantime, stretch a piece of plastic wrap over a dinner plate.
Once the chocolate is melted, remove it from the heat and stir in the peanuts, coating them with the chocolate. Spread the mixture on the plastic-lined plate and chill.
Mixing them in: Use a chef's knife to chop the chocolate-covered block of peanuts into bite-sized pieces, then mix them into 1 quart (1 liter) of ice cream as you remove it from the machine.
Storage: Chocolate-Covered Peanuts can be stored for several months in an airtight container, refrigerated or at room temperature.

Rinse rice well in a sieve under cold running water, then drain well. Transfer to a 2- to 3-quart heavy saucepan and add 3 cups water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and cover pan with a tight-fitting lid. Cook 20 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, 5 minutes. Stir gently with a heatproof rubber spatula, folding from top to bottom of pan.

1. Preheat a gas or charcoal grill to medium, or the oven to 450° F.
2. Toss together the grapes, rosemary, and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil; set aside.
3. Divide the dough into thirds and stretch each portion into a 10-inch circle.
4. Place the rounds on the grill or in the oven until cooked through, about 6 minutes, flipping each halfway through if using a grill.
5. Distribute the grapes, spoonfuls of the goat cheese, and the remaining olive oil on the pizzas.
6. Cover the grill (if using) and heat until the cheese begins to melt, about 5 minutes.

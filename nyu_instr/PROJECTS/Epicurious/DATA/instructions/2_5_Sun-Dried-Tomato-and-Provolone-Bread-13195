Into a large bowl sift together the flour, the baking powder, the salt, and the baking soda, add the provolone, the scallion, the parsley, the rosemary, the pepper, and the sun-dried tomatoes, and toss the mixture well. In a small bowl whisk together the shortening, the reserved sun-dried tomato oil, and the sugar until the mixture is smooth, add the garlic, the eggs, and the buttermilk, and blend mixture until it is combined well. Add the buttermilk mixture to the flour mixture with the pine nuts and stir the batter until it is just combined. Divide the batter among 3 well-buttered 5 3/4- by 3 1/4-inch loaf pans, smoothing the tops, and bake the loaves in the middle of a preheated 350°F. oven for 45 to 50 minutes, or until a tester comes out clean. Let the loaves cool in the pans for 5 minutes, loosen the edges with a knife, and turn the loaves out onto a rack.

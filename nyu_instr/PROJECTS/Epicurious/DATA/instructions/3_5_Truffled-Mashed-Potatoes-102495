Cook potatoes in large pot of boiling salted water until very tender, about 20 minutes. Drain. Return potatoes to pot. Stir over medium heat until excess moisture evaporates, about 1 minute. Remove from heat. Add half and half, butter, olive oil and truffle oil. Mash until smooth. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Stir in chopped truffles, if desired. Transfer to bowl and serve.

Overlap tomato and onion slices on large platter. Whisk oil, vinegar, parsley and garlic in small bowl. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Pour over salad. Let stand at room temperature 1 hour or cover and refrigerate up to 3 hours, basting occasionally with dressing.
Sprinkle salad with cheese and garnish with olives, if desired.

Prepare barbecue (medium heat) or preheat broiler. Grill bread until golden brown, watching closely so that bread does not burn, about 2 minutes per side. Spread 1 side of each bread slice with 1 generous teaspoon olivada. Top with bell peppers, then cheese. Season with pepper. Sprinkle with chopped fresh parsley.

Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 400°F. Butter a 13- by 9-inch metal baking pan and line bottom with wax paper or parchment, then butter paper.
Finely grind nuts with flour, salt, and 2 tablespoons granulated sugar in a food processor.
Beat together butter and remaining 1/2 cup granulated sugar in a bowl with an electric mixer until pale and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating until just incorporated. Fold in nut mixture gently but thoroughly.
Spread batter evenly in baking pan and bake until torte is lightly browned around edges and firm but springy to the touch, about 15 minutes.
Run a small knife around edges of cake, then invert a rack over pan and flip cake onto rack. Remove paper, turn cake right side up, and cool 10 minutes. Transfer cake to a cutting board and halve crosswise. Spread jam on top of 1 half, then place second half on top, right side up. Cut torte into 4 squares, then cut each square diagonally into triangles.
Dust triangles with confectioners sugar and serve with additional jam if desired.

Halve garlic. Cut six 1/3-inch-thick slices from middle of loaf and brush bread with oil. Lightly oil a well-seasoned ridged grill pan and heat over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking. Grill bread until golden brown on both sides. Immediately rub bread on 1 side with cut side of garlic and sprinkle with salt.

Cook corn in pot of boiling salted water 2 minutes. Drain and cool corn. Cut off enough kernels to measure 4 cups (reserve remaining corn for another use). Place corn in medium bowl. Add mangoes, jicama, red onion, cilantro and lime juice. Toss to combine. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate until cold. (Can be prepared 3 hours ahead. Keep refrigerated.) Serve cold.

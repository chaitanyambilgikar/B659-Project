Preheat oven to 350°F.
Peel potatoes. Slice potatoes very thin with a sharp knife and put them in a medium pot with half-and-half, 2 teaspoons salt, and freshly ground white pepper. Stir well and simmer the potatoes for 15 minutes, or until they are just beginning to soften.
Transfer potatoes and half-and-half mixture to a shallow medium casserole. The liquid should come just to the tops of the potatoes. Cover evenly with the shredded cheese. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until potatoes are tender and cheese is golden brown.

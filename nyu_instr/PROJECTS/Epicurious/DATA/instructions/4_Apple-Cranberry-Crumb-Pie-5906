Make topping: Mix first 4 ingredients in medium bowl. Add butter; rub in with fingertips until mixture resembles coarse meal. Set aside.
Make filling: Place baking sheet in oven and preheat to 350°F. Toss apples, cranberry sauce, sugar and cornstarch in large bowl until well blended.
Transfer apple-cranberry filling to frozen pie shell, mounding in center. Sprinkle topping over pie. Set pie on baking sheet in oven. Bake until apples are tender, juices bubble thickly and crust is golden, about 1 hour 10 minutes. Transfer to rack. Cool 15 minutes. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream.

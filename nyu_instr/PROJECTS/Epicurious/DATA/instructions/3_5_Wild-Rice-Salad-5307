Bring 8 cups water to boil in large saucepan. Add rice; reduce heat to medium. Cook until just tender but not split, stirring occasionally, about 40 minutes. Drain. Rinse with cold water; drain well.
Place rice in large bowl. Mix remaining ingredients into rice. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be made 2 hours ahead. Cover; let stand at room temperature.)

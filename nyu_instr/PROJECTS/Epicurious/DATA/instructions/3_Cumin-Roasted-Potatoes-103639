Preheat oven to 450°F. Stir whole cumin seeds in heavy small skillet over medium heat just until fragrant, about 45 seconds.
Transfer cumin seeds to 13x9x2-inch baking pan. Add olive oil, salt and paprika and whisk to blend. Add russet potato pieces and toss to coat well. Spread out potatoes in single layer in baking pan. Roast potatoes until brown and crisp around edges, stirring occasionally, about 35 minutes. Serve cumin potatoes hot.

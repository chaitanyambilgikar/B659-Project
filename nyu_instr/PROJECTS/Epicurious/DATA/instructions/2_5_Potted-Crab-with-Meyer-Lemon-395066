Bring juice and Sherry to a boil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat; cook until reduced to 1 tablespoon, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a mini-processor; let cool. Add butter, lemon zest, and harissa; purée until smooth. Transfer to a small bowl. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Gently fold crabmeat into butter (keep crab pieces intact). Pack crab butter into a crock, smoothing top with a butter knife. Cover and chill for at least 3 hours and up to 2 days.
Garnish with lemon slices, if desired. Let stand until room temperature, about 1 hour, and serve with buttered toast points.

For vinaigrette: Stir coriander in small skillet over medium heat until fragrant, about 4 minutes. Cool. Coarsely grind coriander in mortar with pestle or in spice mill. Transfer to small bowl. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in same skillet over medium heat. Add shallots; sauté until soft, about 3 minutes. Transfer to bowl with coriander. Add vinegar, garlic, salt, and pepper. Gradually whisk in 7 tablespoons oil. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill; discard garlic after 1 hour. Let vinaigrette stand at room temperature 1 hour before using.)
For pesto: Puree first 9 ingredients in blender until smooth. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Reblend before continuing.) Whisk in lime juice.
For beets: Preheat oven to 350°F. Wash and dry beets. Cut off beet greens 1 inch from top of beets; reserve for another use. Rub beets with oil. Place light-colored beets in 1 roasting pan and red beets in another; sprinkle with coarse salt. Cover pans tightly with foil. Roast until beets are just tender, about 55 minutes. Cool slightly. Using towel, rub off peel and stems from beets. Cut beets in half. Place light-colored beets and red beets in 2 separate bowls. Toss beets in each bowl with 2 tablespoons vinaigrette. Let stand 30 minutes. Toss lettuces in bowl with some of vinaigrette to coat lightly; divide among plates and top with beets. Drizzle pesto around salads and serve.

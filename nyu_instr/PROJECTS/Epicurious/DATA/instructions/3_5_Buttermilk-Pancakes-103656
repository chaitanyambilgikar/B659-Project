Whisk flour, 2 tablespoons sugar, baking powder and salt in large bowl to blend. Add buttermilk, egg yolks and vanilla and whisk until smooth (batter will be very thick). Using electric mixer, beat whites in medium bowl to soft peaks. Add remaining 1 tablespoon sugar and beat until stiff but not dry; fold into batter.
Melt butter on griddle or in heavy large skillet over medium-low heat. Working in batches, pour batter by 1/4 cupfuls onto griddle. Cook until pancakes are golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to plates. Serve with syrup.

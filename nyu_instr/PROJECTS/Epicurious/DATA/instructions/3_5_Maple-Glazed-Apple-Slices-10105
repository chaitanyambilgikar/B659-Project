Peel and core apples and cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices. In a 12-inch heavy skillet heat butter over moderately high heat until foam subsides and sauté apples, turning them, until golden and tender. Stir in maple syrup, water, lemon juice, cinnamon, and a pinch of salt and cook, stirring, until apples are glazed.

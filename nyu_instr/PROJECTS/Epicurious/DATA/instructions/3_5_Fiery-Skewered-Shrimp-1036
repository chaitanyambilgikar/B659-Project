Mix olive oil, garlic, minced ginger and crushed red pepper in shallow dish. Add shrimp, turning to coat with oil mixture. Let stand at room temperature 15 minutes or refrigerate up to 2 hours.
Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat) or preheat broiler. Thread 4 shrimp on each of 4 skewers. Grill or broil just until cooked through, about 3 minutes per side. Sprinkle shrimp with chopped cilantro. Garnish with lemon or lime and serve immediately.

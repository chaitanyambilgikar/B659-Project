In a shallow dish let the skewers soak in water to cover for 1 hour. On a cutting board mince and mash the garlic to a paste with the salt. In a bowl combine the garlic paste, the oil, and 1 of the jalapeño peppers minced (wear rubber gloves) and toss them until they are coated with the marinade, and let them marinate for 30 minutes. Cut the remaining jalapeño peppers crosswise into forty-eight 1/4-inch slices and thread 1 shrimp around 1 jalapeño slice on each skewer. The brochettes may be prepared up to this point 2 hours in advance and kept covered and chilled.
Grill the brochettes on a rack set about 4 inches over glowing coals, turning them once, for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the shrimp are pink and just firm.
(Alternatively, the brochettes can be broiled on racks set in jelly-roll pans under a preheated broiler about 4 inches from the heat, turning them once, for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the shrimp are pink and just firm.)

Preheat oven to 475°F. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment. Divide dough in half. Roll out 1 half on lightly floured surface to 131/2x81/2-inch rectangle. Transfer to 1 baking sheet. Repeat with second half. Spread 1/4 cup marinara sauce over each pizza, leaving 1/2-inch border. Sprinkle cheeses over, then mushrooms and pancetta. Sprinkle with salt and generous amount of pepper.
Bake pizzas until brown on bottom and cheese is melted, about 15 minutes. Cut each pizza crosswise into rectangles.

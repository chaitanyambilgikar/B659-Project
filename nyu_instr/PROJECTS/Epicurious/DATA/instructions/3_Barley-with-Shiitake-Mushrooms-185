Soak mushrooms in 2 cups hot water until tender. Drain mushrooms, reserving water. Trim mushroom stems and discard. Slice mushroom caps. Heat both oils in heavy large saucepan over medium heat. Add white parts of green onions, carrot and garlic. Sauté until onions are tender, about 3 minutes. Stir in mushrooms and sauté 2 minutes longer. Mix in barley. Add reserved water, 3 cups broth and soy sauce. Simmer until barley is tender and liquid is absorbed, about 45 minutes. Transfer barley to serving dish; garnish with remaining green onion and serve.

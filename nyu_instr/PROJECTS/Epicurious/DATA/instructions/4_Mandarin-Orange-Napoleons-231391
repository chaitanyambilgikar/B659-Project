Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 375°F.
Whisk together five-spice powder and 2 tablespoons granulated sugar in a small bowl.
Cover phyllo with overlapping sheets of plastic wrap and a dampened kitchen towel. Arrange 1 phyllo sheet on a large baking sheet, then brush with some butter and sprinkle with one third of spiced sugar. Make 2 more layers in same manner. Top with remaining phyllo sheet and brush with remaining butter. (For a corrugated look, invert a large rectangular cooling rack and place it on top of phyllo.)
Bake until golden, 12 to 15 minutes. Carefully remove cooling rack (if using) and transfer phyllo (in 1 piece) with 2 metal spatulas to another rack to cool.
While phyllo cools, blend together cream cheese, lemon juice, vanilla, 2 tablespoons reserved orange syrup (discard remainder), and remaining 2 tablespoons granulated sugar in a food processor until smooth. Transfer to a bowl and fold in oranges.
Break phyllo with your hands or cut with a serrated knife into 12 pieces. Arrange 1 piece of phyllo on a plate and top with a dollop of orange cream. Repeat layering and top with another piece of phyllo. Make 3 more napoleons in same manner. Dust with confectioners sugar.

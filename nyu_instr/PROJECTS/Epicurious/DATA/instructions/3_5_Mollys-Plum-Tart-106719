1. Prepare the pastry: Combine the flour, butter, sugar, and salt in the bowl of a food processor. Process the mixture until it resembles a coarse meal. Add the egg yolk and cold water; process until the dough just comes together in the side of the bowl. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour to chill.
2. Preheat the oven to 400°F. Combine the almonds, 1/4 cup of the sugar, and the flour in the food processor; process until it resembles powder. Reserve.
3. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out 1/8-inch thick into a large rectangle; transfer to a 12x15-inch baking sheet. Spread the reserved almond mixture over the bottom of the dough, leaving a 1- to 1 1/2-inch border.
4. Arrange the plums, cut-side down, over the almond mixture. Fold the dough up over the plums, pressing and pinching it together to make a nice edge. Sprinkle the remaining 2 tablespoons of sugar over the plums, then dot with butter.
5. Bake for 1 hour, or until the filling is bubbly and the crust is golden. Meanwhile, whisk together the red currant jelly and Grand Marnier. Brush the mixture over the entire tart just after it comes out of the oven. Cool the tart slightly. Cut into squares and serve warm.

Boil 1 cup maple syrup and walnut pieces in heavy medium saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir mixture frequently until syrup begins to get cloudy, about 2 minutes. Pour mixture onto sheet of foil and cool. Chop praline finely.
Whisk pancake mix, 3/4 cup water, and brandy in small bowl to form smooth thin batter. Heat medium (7- to 8-inch-diameter) nonstick skillet over medium heat. For each crepe, brush skillet with oil and pour in very scant 1/4 cup batter, rotating skillet so batter covers bottom. Cook until edges brown, about 40 seconds. Loosen edges with spatula, lift, and turn crepe over. Cook until bottom browns in spots, about 30 seconds. Turn out onto paper towel. Repeat with remaining batter, placing crepes between paper towels.
Fold crepes into quarters and divide among 4 plates. Sprinkle generously with praline and drizzle with crème fraîche and maple syrup.

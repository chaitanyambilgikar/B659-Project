Preheat oven to 350°F. Arrange six 1 1/4-cup soufflé dishes or custard cups in large roasting pan, spacing apart. Stir 1 cup sugar, flour and salt in large bowl to blend. Whisk in milk, egg yolks, fruit juices, butter, orange peel, lemon peel and vanilla extract (batter will be thin).
Using electric mixer, beat whites in medium bowl until very frothy. Gradually add remaining 1/4 cup sugar, beating until medium-firm peaks form. Fold 1/4 of whites into batter to lighten. Fold in remaining whites. Divide batter among soufflé dishes. Top with ginger slices.
Pour enough hot water into roasting pan to come halfway up sides of dishes. Bake cakes until tops are golden brown and beginning to split and pudding layer on bottom appears thickened, about 40 minutes. Transfer desserts to rack; cool at least 20 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate; serve cold.)
Garnish cakes with fresh raspberries and mint, if desired, and serve.

Whisk mayonnaise, garlic and lemon juice in small bowl to blend.
Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). When coals turn white, drain chips, if using, and scatter over coals. When chips begin to smoke, brush cut side of tomatoes with oil and place on grill, cut side down. Cover and grill tomatoes until hot, juicy and tender, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to plate. Season tomatoes with salt and pepper. Top each tomato half with dollop of garlic mayonnaise.

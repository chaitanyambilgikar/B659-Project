1. In a heavy 5-quart pot over moderately high heat, heat the oil until hot but not smoking. Season the beef with salt and sear it, turning occasionally, until deep brown on all sides, about 10 minutes. Add the chile, garlic, and onion, and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until the onion begins to tenderize, about 5 minutes. Add the tomato paste, wine, and tomatoes, and bring to a boil.
2. Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid, reduce the heat to low, and simmer until the meat is very tender, 3 to 4 hours. The finished sauce should be a deep, rich red color. (The sauce is ready to combine with the fettuccine now, or you can cool and store it in the refrigerator up to 4 days.)
3. Bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil. Add the fettuccine and stir to submerge and separate it. Cook according to the package directions until al dente.
4. Drain the fettuccine, shaking well to remove any excess water, and transfer to a large serving bowl. Add the sauce and toss together until the pasta is evenly coated. Serve at once with the braised meat as desired.

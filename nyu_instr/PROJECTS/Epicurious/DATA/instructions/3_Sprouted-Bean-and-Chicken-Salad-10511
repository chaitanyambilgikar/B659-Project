In a 6-quart kettle bring broth and water to a boil. Add chicken and simmer, covered, 9 minutes. Remove kettle from heat and let chicken stand in cooking liquid, covered, until cooked through, about 20 minutes. Chicken may be poached 1 day ahead, cooled completely, uncovered, in cooking liquid, and chilled, covered. Bring chicken to room temperature to continue. Cut chicken into 1/2-inch pieces.
In a large bowl whisk together vinegar, lemon juice, sugar, and salt and pepper to taste until sugar is dissolved. Whisk in oil and mayonnaise in a stream, whisking until emulsified. Add chicken and remaining ingredients and toss until combined well.

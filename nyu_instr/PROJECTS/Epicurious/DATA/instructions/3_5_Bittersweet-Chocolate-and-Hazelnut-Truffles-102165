Place chocolate in medium metal bowl. Bring cream to simmer in small saucepan. Pour over chocolate; let stand 2 minutes. Whisk until smooth. Mix in brandy and vanilla. Cool completely, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes.
Using electric mixer, beat chocolate mixture until fluffy and lighter in color, about 4 minutes. Mix in 6 tablespoons ground hazelnuts. Cover and refrigerate truffle mixture until firm, about 2 hours.
Line baking sheet with waxed paper. Place 1 1/2 cups chopped nuts in another medium bowl. Fill glass with hot water. Dip 1-inch-diameter melon baller into water, then into truffle mixture, forming round truffle. Drop truffle into nuts; roll to coat completely and press to adhere. Place on prepared sheet. Repeat with remaining truffle mixture and nuts. Cover and chill until firm, about 1 hour. (Can be made 2 days ahead; keep chilled.)

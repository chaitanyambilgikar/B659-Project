Preheat oven to 350°F. Line large rimmed baking sheet with foil. Toss asparagus with 2 tablespoons olive oil on prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Roast until asparagus is just tender, about 15 minutes. (Can be prepared 3 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.)
Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Add asparagus, nuts, and wine. Toss until asparagus is heated through, about 3 minutes. Season with additional salt and pepper, if desired. Arrange on platter.

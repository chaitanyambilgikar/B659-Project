Lightly butter four 4-ounce ramekins or soufflé dishes. Cut each piece of pâté into 4 cubes. Divide pâté cubes among prepared dishes. Crack 1 egg into each dish, keeping yolks whole. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Drizzle 1 tablespoon cream over each egg. Sprinkle truffle slivers over, if desired. Sprinkle with tarragon and parsley. Cover each dish tightly with foil.
Fill large skillet with water to depth of 1/2 inch. Bring to simmer over medium heat. Add ramekins. Cook until egg whites are firm and yolks are still runny, about 8 minutes. Remove ramekins from water; remove foil and wipe ramekins dry. Serve on small plates with toasts.

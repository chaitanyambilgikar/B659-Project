Preheat oven to 325°F. Butter two 9x5x3-inch loaf pans. Dust pans with flour. Combine first 8 ingredients in medium bowl; stir to blend well. Whisk eggs, sugar and buttermilk in large bowl. Add dry ingredients; stir to combine. Add pumpkin and oil; stir until blended. Divide batter between prepared pans.
Bake until tester inserted into center of each loaf comes out clean, about 1 hour 20 minutes. Let loaves cool 10 minutes. Cut around pan sides to loosen loaves, if necessary. Turn out loaves onto racks; cool completely. (Can be made ahead. Wrap tightly and store at room temperature 1 day or freeze up to 1 month.)

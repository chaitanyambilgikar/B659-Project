In a small bowl stir together the salt, the cinnamon, the allspice, the cloves, and pepper to taste. Pat the pork chops dry with paper towels, rub the spice mixture on both sides of them, and chill the chops, covered, for 30 minutes. Broil the chops on the oiled rack of a broiler pan under a preheated broiler about 4 inches from the heat for 5 minutes on each side, or until they are cooked through.

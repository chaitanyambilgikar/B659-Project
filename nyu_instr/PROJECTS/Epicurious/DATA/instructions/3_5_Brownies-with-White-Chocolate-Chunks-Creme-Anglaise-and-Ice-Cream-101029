Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter 9 x 9 x 2-inch metal baking pan. Combine butter, unsweetened chocolate and bittersweet chocolate in heavy medium saucepan. Stir over low heat until melted and smooth. Remove from heat. Add 1 cup sugar and stir until sugar dissolves, about 1 minute. Stir in vanilla extract.
Whisk eggs and 1 cup sugar in large bowl to blend. Whisk half of egg mixture into chocolate mixture. Using electric mixer, beat remaining egg mixture until pale yellow and slightly thickened, about 3 minutes. Gently fold chocolate mixture and salt into egg mixture. Gently fold in flour, then white chocolate chips. Spoon into prepared pan.
Bake brownies until tester inserted into center comes out with moist crumbs attached, about 28 minutes. Transfer to rack. Cool completely. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover; let stand at room temperature.) Cut brownies into squares. Serve with Crâ€¨me Anglaise and ice cream.

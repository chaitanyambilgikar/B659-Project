In a food processor or blender puree the raspberries, the peaches, the sugar, the oil, and 1/8 teaspoon of the crushed peppercorns, force the mixture through a fine sieve set over a bowl, pressing hard on the solids, and chill the sauce, covered, until it is very cold. Divide the melon wedges among 4 chilled dessert plates and pour some of the sauce over each serving. sprinkle each serving with some of the sliced basil and some of the additional crushed peppercorns and garnish the plates with the basin sprigs.

Preheat oven to 400°F. Toss chiles, bell peppers, oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, sugar, coriander, and cumin in a large bowl. Season to taste with black pepper and toss to coat evenly. Arrange peppers in a single layer in a large roasting pan, overlapping as needed.
Roast until peppers are soft and edges begin to brown, about 1 hour. Transfer to a large bowl. Halve, pit, and slice nectarines; add to warm peppers. Add lemon juice and toss to combine. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

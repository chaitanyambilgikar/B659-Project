Mix salt, pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon allspice in small bowl. Rub spice mixture over both sides of chicken. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in each of 2 large nonstick skillets over medium-high heat. Divide chicken between skillets and sauté until cooked through, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to work surface. Tent with foil to keep warm. Add 1/4 cup wine to each skillet and bring to boil, scraping up any browned bits. Combine wine in 1 skillet. Stir in broth, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, and lemon peel. Boil until reduced to 1/2 cup, about 5 minutes. Whisk in shallots, thyme, 6 tablespoons oil, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, and 1/4 teaspoon allspice; season sauce with salt and pepper. Cut chicken crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick slices.
Divide chicken among plates. Spoon sauce over. Sprinkle with parsley.

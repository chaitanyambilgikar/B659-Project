Combine 3 chopped celery stalks, 1 chopped onion, 1 turkey carcass (broken into pieces), and water to cover (12-14 cups) in a stockpot. Set over high heat and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until broth is reduced by 1/3, about 3 1/2 hours. Strain; discard solids. Let cool; cover and chill. DO AHEAD Stock will keep chilled for 3 days or frozen for 3 months.

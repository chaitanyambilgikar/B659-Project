Whisk eggs, salt and pepper in large bowl until well blended. Heat oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Working in batches, add tortilla strips; cook just until softened, about 15 seconds per batch. Drain on paper towels. Add green onions and chili to skillet; stir 2 minutes. Reduce heat to medium. Add eggs and tortilla strips to skillet and stir until almost set, about 4 minutes. Add cheese, tomatoes and cilantro. Stir until eggs are set and cheese melts, about 1 minute. Serve immediately.

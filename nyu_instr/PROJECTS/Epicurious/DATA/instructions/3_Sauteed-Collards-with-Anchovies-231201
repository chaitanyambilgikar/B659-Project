Cook collards in a large pot of boiling salted water, uncovered, until barely tender, 6 to 8 minutes, then drain well in a colander and coarsely chop.
Heat oil, garlic, anchovies, and pepper in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately low heat, stirring frequently, until anchovies are dissolved and garlic is fragrant but not browned, about 3 minutes. Add collards and increase heat to moderate. Cook, stirring frequently, until collards are just tender and flavors are blended, 5 to 10 minutes.

Cut stems from center of each kale leaf; discard stems. Bring large pot of salted water to boil. Add kale leaves and cook just until kale is tender but still bright green, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain well. Coarsely chop kale.
Preheat oven to 400°F. Arrange baguette slices in single layer on rimmed baking sheet; brush slices on top side with 2 tablespoons oil. Sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper. Toast in oven until pale golden, about 12 minutes. Cool toasts on baking sheet. DO AHEAD: Kale and baguette toasts can be made 4 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.
Heat remaining 3 tablespoons oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Add garlic and anchovies; stir 1 minute. Add chopped kale and sauté until heated through, 3 to 4 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Mound kale mixture atop toasted baguette slices, dividing equally. Top kale with cheese shavings. Arrange crostini on platter and serve.
What to drink: The bold flavors of this and the chicken liver crostini would be great with Prosecco, the Italian sparkler. We like the light, crisp—and affordable—Zardetto NV Prosecco Brut (Italy, $15).
* Also called Tuscan kale, dinosaur kale, lacinato kale, or cavolo nero, black kale has long, narrow, very dark green bumpy leaves; available at some supermarkets and farmers’ markets.

Trim and discard any yellow or coarse leaves and the tough stem ends from the broccoli rabe and chop the broccoli rabe coarse. Wash the broccoli rabe and drain it. In a large heavy skillet cook the bacon over moderate heat, stirring, until it is crisp and transfer it with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of the fat and in the fat remaining in the skillet cook the onion and the garlic over moderately low heat, stirring, until the onion is softened. Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the parsley, the lemon juice, the zest, the red pepper flakes, and salt to taste.
In a kettle of salted boiling water cook the linguine for 7 to 9 minutes, or until it is al dente, adding the broccoli rabe 1 minute before the pasta is done. Drain the linguine mixture well and transfer it to the skillet. Toss the linguine mixture until it is combined well and sprinkle it with the bacon.

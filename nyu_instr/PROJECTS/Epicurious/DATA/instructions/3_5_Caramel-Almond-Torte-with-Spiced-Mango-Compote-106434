For compote: Combine first 6 ingredients in heavy medium saucepan. Bring syrup to boil over medium-high heat, stirring until sugar dissolves. Boil syrup 5 minutes. Pour into medium bowl; cool 30 minutes. Mix in mangoes. Cover and chill at least 2 hours and up to 4 days.
For torte: Preheat oven to 375°F. Blend 1 3/4 cups almonds, 2 tablespoons sugar, potato starch, and cinnamon in processor until nuts are finely chopped, about 45 seconds. Using electric mixer, beat egg yolks, 2 tablespoons sugar, and almond extract in large bowl until very thick and pale in color, about 3 minutes. Fold almond mixture into yolk mixture.
Using clean dry beaters, beat egg whites, and salt in medium bowl until soft peaks form. Gradually add remaining 4 tablespoons sugar, beating until stiff but not dry. Fold large spoonful of whites into yolk mixture to lighten. Fold in remaining whites in 2 additions.
Transfer batter to 9-inch-diameter springform pan. Bake torte until puffed and golden brown and tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Immediately invert pan onto rack. Cool torte (upside down) completely. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and store right side up at room temperature.)
Melt margarine in heavy medium skillet over medium heat. Whisk in brown sugar. Cook until caramel bubbles and is smooth and thick, about 3 minutes. Mix in remaining 1/2 cup almonds. Spoon topping over torte. Cool 1 hour. (Can be made 6 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.)
Cut around pan sides to loosen torte; release pan sides. Place torte on platter. Serve with compote.

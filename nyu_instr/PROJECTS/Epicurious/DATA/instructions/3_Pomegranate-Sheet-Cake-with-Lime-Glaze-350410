Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter and flour 13x9x2-inch cake pan. Sift together flour, baking powder, and salt in medium bowl. Beat sugar and butter in large bowl until well blended, 1 minute. Using electric mixer, add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in 1/2 cup pomegranate juice and 2 teaspoons lime peel (mixture may appear curdled). Beat flour mixture into batter just until blended. Stir in yogurt.
Spread batter in pan. Bake until tester inserted into center of cake comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Let cake cool 15 minutes. Meanwhile, sift powdered sugar into medium bowl; whisk in 1/4 cup pomegranate juice, vanilla, and 1 teaspoon lime peel. Using fork, poke holes in top of warm cake, spacing 1 inch apart. Pour glaze over cake and spread evenly. Cool completely. Sprinkle pomegranate seeds, mint, and 1 teaspoon lime peel over cake before serving.
* A thick yogurt sold at some supermarkets, specialty foods stores, and Greek markets.

In a large skillet heat the oil and the butter over moderately high heat until the foam subsides, in the fat sauté the scallops, patted dry, for 30 seconds on each side, or until they are cooked through, and transfer them to a bowl. In the fat remaining in the skillet cook the gingerroot and the shallot over moderately low heat, stirring, until the shallot is softened and stir in the scallion, the scallops with any juice that has accumulated in the bowl, the lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste.

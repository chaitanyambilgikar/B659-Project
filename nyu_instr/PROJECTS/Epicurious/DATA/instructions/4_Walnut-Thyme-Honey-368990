Preheat oven to 325°F. Spread the walnuts on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned and fragrant, about 15 minutes. Let cool. Coarsely chop; set aside.
Whisk honey and oil in a medium bowl to blend. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Fold in walnuts, thyme, and lemon zest. Add chiles. Divide between two 8-ounce jars. Cover and chill. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 month ahead. Keep chilled. Stir before using.

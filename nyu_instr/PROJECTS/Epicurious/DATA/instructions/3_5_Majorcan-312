Place each loaf of bread dough in separate bowl. Add 1 tablespoon oil to each; season each with 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Knead each in bowl until oil is well incorporated, about 3 minutes. Let dough rest in bowls 10 minutes.
Oil two 15x10-inch baking sheets. Turn out dough onto floured surface; knead 1 minute. Roll out each dough piece to irregular 13x9-inch rectangle, pulling and stretching dough. Transfer each to prepared sheet. Brush each with 1 tablespoon oil. Let dough rise uncovered in warm draft-free area until puffy, about 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, preheat oven to 400°F. Heat 3 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add onions and garlic; sauté 1 minute. Add bell peppers and chard ribs and sauté until tender, about 10 minutes. Add chard leaves and stir until just wilted and coated with oil, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
Press dough all over with fingers, forming indentations. Brush each with 1 tablespoon of oil. Spread vegetables over, leaving 1-inch border. Bake until crusts are golden, about 25 minutes. Serve at room temperature.

In a steamer set over boiling water steam the carrots, covered, for 8 minutes, or until they are just tender. In a skillet cook the garlic in the oil over moderately low heat, stirring, for 1 minute, or until it is fragrant, add the cumin, the cinnamon, the sugar, the cayenne, and the carrots, and cook the mixture, stirring, for 1 minute, or until the carrots are well-coated with the mixture. Stir in the lemon juice and salt and pepper to taste, transfer the carrots to a bowl, and let them cool to room temperature.

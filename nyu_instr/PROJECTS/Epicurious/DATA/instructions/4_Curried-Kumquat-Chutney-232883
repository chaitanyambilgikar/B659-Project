Cook first 5 ingredients and 1 cup kumquats in heavy small saucepan over medium heat until reduced to scant 1 cup, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. Transfer to small bowl. Chill until cold, then mix in remaining 1/3 cup kumquats and cilantro. Season chutney to taste with salt and pepper. Chill 1 hour.

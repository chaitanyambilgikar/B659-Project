For Dessert: Half fill medium saucepan with water and bring to boil. Whisk sugar, yolks and 1/4 cup cream in small metal bowl. Set bowl over saucepan of boiling water and whisk until candy thermometer registers 160°F, scraping down sides of bowl with rubber spatula, about 4 minutes. Remove from over water. Pour yolk mixture into large bowl. Using electric mixer, beat mixture until cool and thick, about 4 minutes. Beat in vanilla and brandy.
Beat 1 1/2 cups cream with sour cream to stiff peaks in medium bowl. Fold cream into yolk mixture in 2 batches. Gently fold in half of cookie crumbs. Pour mixture into 9-inch-diameter springform pan with 2-inch-high sides. Sprinkle with remaining crumbs. Freeze overnight.
Release sides of springform pan. Garnish dessert with fresh raspberries if desired. Slice into wedges and serve with raspberry sauce.
For Raspberry Sauce: Puree raspberries and syrup in blender or processor until smooth. Strain to remove seeds. (Can be prepared 1 week ahead. Cover and refrigerate.) Makes about 1 cup.

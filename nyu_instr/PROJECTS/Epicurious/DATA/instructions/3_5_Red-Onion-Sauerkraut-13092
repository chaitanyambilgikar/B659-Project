In a large heavy skillet (measuring about 12 inches across and 2 1/2 inches deep) heat oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and sauté onion with cloves and juniper berries, stirring, until browned, about 10 minutes. Add cabbage, sauerkraut, sugar, wine, vinegar, and bay leaf and simmer stirring occasionally and adding water if mixture becomes dry, until cabbage is tender, about 30 minutes. Sauerkraut may be made 2 days ahead and chilled, covered.
Discard bay leaf and serve sauerkraut at room temperature.

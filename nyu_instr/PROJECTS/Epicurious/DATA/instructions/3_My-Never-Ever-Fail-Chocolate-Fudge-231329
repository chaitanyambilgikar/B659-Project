Combine the chocolate pieces, nuts (if using), butter, and vanilla in a large heatproof bowl. Set aside.
Place the marshmallows, sugar, and evaporated milk in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat. Stirring constantly, bring to a boil. Continuing to stir, boil for exactly 6 minutes.
Remove from the heat and immediately pour the marshmallow mixture into the chocolate mixture; beat constantly until creamy. Quickly pour into the prepared pan or platter, pushing slightly with the back of a wooden spoon to spread the fudge evenly.
Cool for at least 1 hour before cutting into pieces. Serve at room temperature.

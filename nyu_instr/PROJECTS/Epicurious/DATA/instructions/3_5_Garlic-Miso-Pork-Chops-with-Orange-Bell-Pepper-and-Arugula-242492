Place pork in large shallow dish. Spread garlic thinly on all sides of chops, then spread miso generously over. Sprinkle with Sherry and let stand 5 minutes.
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add pork. Sauté until just cooked through, about 5 minutes per side.
Meanwhile, combine arugula and bell pepper in medium bowl. Add 2 tablespoons oil and vinegar; toss to coat. Season salad with salt and pepper.
Place 1 pork chop on each of 4 plates. Serve with salad; drizzle with any pan juices and more oil, if desired.

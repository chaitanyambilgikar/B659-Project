Boil cherries, sugar, water, and a pinch of salt in a heavy medium saucepan, uncovered, stirring occasionally, 10 minutes. Strain thourough a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, pressing gently on and then discarding solids. You should have about 1 cup syrup. If more, boil until reduced. Cool, then chill, covered.

Preheat oven to 400°F. Flour large baking sheet. Blend first 6 ingredients in processor until oats are coarsely ground. Add butter; cut in using on/off turns until coarse meal forms. Transfer to bowl. Add beaten whole egg and buttermilk. Using fork, stir to incorporate. Mix in currants (dough will be sticky). Turn dough out onto floured surface. Using floured hands, shape dough into 8-inch round. Using floured 1 3/4-inch-diameter cookie cutter, cut out scones. Gather scraps, reshape, and cut out more scones. Transfer to sheet. Brush tops with yolk. Sprinkle with additional sugar.
Bake scones until golden, about 18 minutes. Cool slightly. Serve warm or at room temperature. (Can be made 8 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.)

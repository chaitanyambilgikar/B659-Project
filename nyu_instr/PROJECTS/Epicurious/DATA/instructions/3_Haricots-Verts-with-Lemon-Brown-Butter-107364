Cook beans in a 2-quart heavy saucepan of boiling water seasoned with 1 teaspoon salt until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes, then drain in a colander.
Wipe out pan and cook butter over moderate heat until deep golden, about 2 minutes. Stir in lemon juice and remaining 1/8 teaspoon salt and remove pan from heat. Add beans and toss well.

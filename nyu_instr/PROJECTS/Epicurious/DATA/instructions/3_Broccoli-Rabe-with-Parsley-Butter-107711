Combine broccoli rabe and 1/2 cup water in large pot. Sprinkle with salt. Bring to simmer over medium-high heat. Cover and simmer until broccoli rabe wilts, about 3 minutes. Uncover and simmer until broccoli rabe is tender and water evaporates, about 4 minutes. Add parsley butter to pot and toss to coat. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Place in bowl and serve immediately.

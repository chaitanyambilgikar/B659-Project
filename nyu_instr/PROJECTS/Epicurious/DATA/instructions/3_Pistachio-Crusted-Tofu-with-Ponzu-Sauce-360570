Cut tofu in half crosswise, then cut each piece in half horizontally, forming 4 rectangles. Press between paper towels to dry. Pour ponzu into shallow bowl or pie dish. Add tofu rectangles to ponzu and marinate 15 minutes, turning occasionally.
Meanwhile, pulse nuts in processor until finely ground (do not allow to turn to paste). Transfer to another shallow bowl.
Pat tofu dry. Sprinkle with pepper. Whisk mayonnaise into ponzu in bowl. Working with 1 tofu piece at a time, coat with ponzu mayonnaise and place in bowl with ground pistachios. Turn to coat; press so nuts adhere. Place tofu on rimmed baking sheet. Repeat with remaining tofu, ponzu mayonnaise, and pistachios.
Heat oil in large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add tofu; cook until golden and heated through, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Spoon remaining ponzu mayonnaise onto plates. Top with tofu and serve.

Finely chop enough scallions to measure about 2 cups and coarsely shred enough carrots to measure about 2 cups. Rinse bean sprouts and trim stringy root ends if desired. In a small bowl lightly beat eggs.
Make seasoning liquid: In a small bowl stir together seasoning liquid ingredients.
Spread rice in a shallow baking pan and separate grains with a fork.
In a deep 12-inch heavy non-stick skillet heat oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and stir-fry eggs until scrambled, about 30 seconds. Add scallions, garlic, and red pepper flakes and stir-fry about 15 seconds, or until fragrant. Add carrots and bean sprouts and stir-fry until carrots begin to soften, about 1 minute. Add rice and cook, stirring frequently, 2 to 3 minutes, or until heated through. Stir seasoning liquid and add to fried rice, tossing to coat evenly.
Serve fried rice sprinkled with cilantro or mint and dry-roasted peanuts.

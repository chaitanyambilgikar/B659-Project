1. Preheat the oven to 300°F.
2. In a medium bowl, stir together the pumpkin, sugar, salt, nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, and milk powder. Add 1 2/3 cups water, along with the flour and eggs, and whisk until completely blended.
3. Place the blind-baked pie shell on a baking sheet and fill with the prepared filling. Bake until the filling sets and the crust browns, 35 to 40 minutes. Let the pie rest at least 1 hour before slicing and serving.

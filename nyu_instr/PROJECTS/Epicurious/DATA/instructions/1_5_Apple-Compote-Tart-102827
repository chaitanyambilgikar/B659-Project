1. Place the flour and the salt in a food processor and process to mix. Add the butter and process until it is blended with the flour to make bits the size of very rough cornmeal. With the processor running, add enough water to make a moist dough, processing quickly 9 or 10 times. Turn out onto a lightly floured board, shape into a flat round, cover and let sit for at least 1 hour and up to 3 hours.
2. For the compote, place the 2 pounds of apples and the water in a large, heavy saucepan over medium heat and bring the liquid to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally, until the apples are completely soft though slightly chunky, which should take about 30 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool. (This makes about 2 cups compote, so you will have plenty left over for other uses.)
3. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Roll out the pastry to fit a 10-1/2 inch removable bottom pastry ring, and leave the edges of the pastry hanging over the ring. Spread the compote evenly over the pastry, and top with the chunks of filling apples. Sprinkle with the sugar. Fold the edges of the pastry over the apples.
4. Whisk the egg and the water together in a small bowl, and brush the pastry all over with the egg wash. Sprinkle the pastry with sugar, and set the tart on a baking sheet. Bake in the bottom third of the oven until the pastry is golden and the apples are tender, about 1 hour. Remove from the oven and immediately remove the ring from the tart pan by setting the tart on a bowl smaller than the base of the tart. Set the tart on a rack to cool to lukewarm then serve, with crème fraîche alongside.

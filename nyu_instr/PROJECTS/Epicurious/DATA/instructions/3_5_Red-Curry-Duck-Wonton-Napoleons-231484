Cut whole scallion crosswise into 2-inch pieces, then cut lengthwise into thin strips and chill, along with cilantro sprigs, in a bowl of ice and cold water (to crisp and curl) about 1 hour.
Heat a wok or 12-inch heavy skillet over high heat until a bead of water dropped onto cooking surface evaporates immediately. Add 1/4 cup oil, swirling wok to coat, and heat until it begins to smoke. Add minced scallion, ginger, and garlic and stir-fry until softened, about 2 minutes. Add red curry paste (to taste) and stir-fry, breaking up lumps, 1 minute. Add duck and stir-fry 2 minutes. Transfer duck mixture to a large bowl and cool slightly.
Add mango, pineapple, bell pepper, chopped cilantro, and salt and pepper to taste to duck mixture.
Heat remaining 2 cups oil in cleaned wok over moderate heat until it registers 390°F on thermometer. Fry wonton wrappers, 1 at a time, turning over once, until golden, about 30 seconds each. Transfer with tongs to paper towels to drain.
Drain scallion strips and cilantro sprigs in a sieve and pat dry.
Put a wonton wrapper on a plate and top with 2 to 3 tablespoons duck mixture. Repeat layering twice, ending with duck mixture. (Napoleon will have 3 wonton layers.) Top with a cilantro sprig and a few scallion strips. Make 7 more napoleons in same manner.

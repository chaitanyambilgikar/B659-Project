Mix sugar, cocoa, cornstarch and salt in heavy medium saucepan. Gradually add half of milk, whisking until mixture is smooth. Whisk in remaining milk. Continue whisking over medium heat until pudding thickens and comes to boil, about 5 minutes. Continue to boil 1 minute longer, whisking constantly.
Remove pudding from heat. Add chocolate and vanilla; whisk until chocolate melts and pudding is smooth. Divide between 2 dessert dishes. Cool puddings in freezer 20 minutes and serve.

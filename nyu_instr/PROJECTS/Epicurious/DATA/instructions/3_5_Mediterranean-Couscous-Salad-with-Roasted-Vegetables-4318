Preheat oven to 400°F. Divide first 5 ingredients between 2 heavy large baking sheets. Brush vegetables with 3 tablespoons oil and balsamic vinegar. Sprinkle herbs over. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Roast until tender, turning occasionally, about 45 minutes. Cool. Remove and discard peels from garlic. Coarsely chop garlic. Cut roasted vegetables into 3/4-inch pieces. Set aside.
Bring 2 1/2 cups water, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 tablespoon oil to boil in medium saucepan. Stir in couscous. Remove from heat. Cover; let stand until water is absorbed, about 5 minutes. Fluff couscous with fork. Transfer to large bowl.
Gently mix roasted garlic and vegetables, 1/4 cup oil, olives, lemon juice, capers and basil into couscous. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Let stand 30 minutes at room temperature before serving.)

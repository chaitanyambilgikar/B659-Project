In a saucepan combine the wine, 1 1/2 cups water, the sugar, the peppercorns, the coriander seeds, the mustard seeds, the salt, and the onion, simmer the mixture for 15 minutes, and let cool to room temperature. Halve the salmon steaks with sharp knife, discarding as many bones as possible, and re-form the steaks. Arrange the steaks in 2 buttered shallow baking pans, ladle the wine mixture around them, and poach the steaks, covered with a buttered piece of foil, on the upper and lower racks of a preheated 375°F. oven, switching the positions of the pans after 15 minutes, for 30 minutes. Let the steaks cool, venting the foil, and chill them in the poaching liquid, covered, for at least 6 hours or overnight.
Separate the salmon steaks into halves, brush them with some of the poaching liquid, and arrange them on a platter. Garnish the salmon with dill sprigs and the lemon slice and serve it with the sauce.

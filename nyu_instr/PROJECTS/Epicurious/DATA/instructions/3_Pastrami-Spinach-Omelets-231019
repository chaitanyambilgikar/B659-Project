Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat until hot but not smoking. Add spinach all at once and cook, stirring, until wilted, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a colander and drain, pressing lightly. Toss spinach with pastrami, 1/4 cup cheese, and salt and pepper to taste in a bowl.
Whisk together 3 eggs and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a bowl until blended. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in an 8-inch nonstick skillet over moderate heat until hot but not smoking. Add whisked eggs and cook, lifting up cooked egg around edge occasionally to let raw egg flow underneath, until omelet is set but top is still slightly moist, about 1 to 2 minutes. Spoon one fourth of spinach mixture over half of omelet and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon cheese. Fold other half of omelet over filling using a heatproof rubber spatula and transfer to a plate. Keep warm, covered with foil.
Make 3 more omelets in same manner with remaining eggs, salt, oil, spinach mixture, and cheese.

In a small saucepan bring vinegar to a boil. Stir in sugar and simmer 5 minutes. With a mortar and pestle or in a bowl with back of a spoon pound or mash garlic to a paste with salt. Add red pepper flakes and combine well. Stir garlic paste into vinegar and cool. Sauce keeps, sealed in a jar and chilled, 5 days.
Serve sauce at room temperature in individual condiment bowls for dipping.

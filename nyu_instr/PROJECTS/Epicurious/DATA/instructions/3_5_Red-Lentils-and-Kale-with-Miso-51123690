Place the lentils in a large saucepan and cover with 1 1/2 cups of the broth. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and cook, uncovered, until the lentils are tender, about 25 minutes. Stir in the garlic, sweet potato, celery, onion, tomatoes, and the remaining 2 1/2 cups of broth. Continue to cook, uncovered, for about 20 minutes, or until the sweet potato is tender. Stir in the miso, kale, and sage. Season to taste with salt and pepper, ladle into bowls, garnish with the nori, and serve.

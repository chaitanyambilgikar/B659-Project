Roll out dough on lightly floured surface to 14-inch round. Transfer to 10-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom. Cut off all but 1/2-inch overhang. Fold overhang in, pressing to form double-thick sides that extend 1/4 inch above rim. Chill crust 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375°F. Bake crust 5 minutes. Using back of fork, press up sides of crust if slipping. Bake until golden, pressing up sides and piercing with fork if crust bubbles, about 25 minutes longer. Cool crust completely.

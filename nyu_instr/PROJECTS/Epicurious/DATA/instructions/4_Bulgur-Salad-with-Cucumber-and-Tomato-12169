In a small saucepan combine the bulgur, the salt, and 3/4 cup water and simmer the mixture, covered, for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the water is absorbed. Transfer the bulgur to a bowl, let it cool for 10 minutes, and stir in the lemon juice, the oil, the parsley, the cucumber, the tomatoes, the scallion, and salt and pepper to taste.

Cook bacon in heavy large skillet over medium heat until crisp. Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towels to drain. Pour off all but 1 1/2 teaspoons fat from skillet. Add sage; sauté 1 minute. Add corn; sauté 1 minute. Add 5 1/2 cups water; increase heat to medium-high and bring to boil. Gradually whisk in polenta. Reduce heat to low; cook until polenta begins to thicken, stirring frequently, about 20 minutes. Stir in cream, cheese, and bacon. Season with salt and pepper. Serve immediately.
* Available at Italian markets, natural foods stores, and some supermarkets. If unavailable, substitute an equal amount of regular yellow cornmeal, and cook mixture for about half the amount of time.

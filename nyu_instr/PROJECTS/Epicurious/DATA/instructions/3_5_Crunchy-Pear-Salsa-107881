Combine all ingredients in medium bowl. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be made 3 hours ahead. Cover; chill.)
Market Tip: Mexican limes, sold at Latin American markets and some supermarkets, are especially good in this recipe because they are sweeter and more fragrant than Persian limes (the more familiar variety). Mexican limes are also referred to as Key limes, which are available at Melissa's (melissas.com; 800-588-0151).

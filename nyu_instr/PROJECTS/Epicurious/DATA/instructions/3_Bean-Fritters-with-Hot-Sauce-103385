Prepare peas: Soak peas in water to cover by 2 inches for 8 hours. Drain in a colander.
Make sauce: Purée bell peppers, onion, tomato, chile, and salt in a food processor.
Heat oil in a 10-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then cook purée over moderate heat, stirring, about 8 minutes. Stir in ground shrimp. Cook, stirring occasionally, until most of liquid is evaporated, 3 to 5 minutes more.
Make fritters: Purée drained peas, onion, and chile in a food processor until as smooth as possible and blend in egg and salt. Blend in 6 tablespoons water until smooth and fluffy, adding remaining 2 tablespoons water if necessary to form a batter just thin enough to drop from a spoon.
Fry fritters: Heat 2 inches oil in a 4-quart Dutch oven or a wide 4-inch-deep heavy pot until a deep-fat thermometer registers 375°F, then gently drop batter by tablespoons into hot oil, forming 8 fritters. Fry until golden, about 1 1/2 minutes on each side, and transfer to paper towels to drain. Make more fritters in same manner, returning oil to 375°F between batches.

Place duck breasts, skin side down, on work surface. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Combine garlic, fennel, rosemary and olive oil in small bowl. Press herb mixture over duck breast meat. Place 1 breast atop the other, meaty sides together. Tie breasts together with cooking string.
Preheat oven to 400°F. Heat heavy large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Add tied duck breasts and cook until well browned on all sides, turning occasionally, about 10 minutes. Pour fat from skillet and discard. Transfer skillet with duck to oven. Roast duck to desired doneness, turning occasionally, about 25 minutes for medium. Transfer duck to work surface; let rest 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, pour pan drippings into glass measuring cup. Spoon fat off top. Remove string and cut each breast into 1/2-inch slices. Drizzle any pan juices over and serve immediately.

Chop fish bones and trimmings and in a well-buttered heavy saucepan cook with onion, parsley, lemon juice, and salt, covered, over moderate heat 5 minutes. Add water and wine and bring to a boil, skimming froth. Simmer stock 20 minutes. Pour stock through a fine sieve into a heatproof bowl and cool, uncovered. Stock keeps, covered and chilled, 3 days, or frozen in an airtight container, 3 months.

Cook bacon in same skillet over medium-high heat until brown and crisp. Using tongs, transfer bacon to paper towels to drain.
Place roll bottoms on plates; spread with dressing. Slice steaks thinly and divide among rolls. Top with bacon, mushrooms, and arugula. Cover sandwiches with roll tops and serve.

Preheat broiler. Put tortillas in single layer on baking sheet. Brush with oil. Broil until toasted, about 3 minutes. Turn; set aside.
Place squash in microwave-safe bowl. Sprinkle water over, cover with plastic wrap, and microwave until just tender, about 3 minutes; drain. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and sauté until beginning to brown, about 3 minutes. Add squash; stir 1 minute. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Spread out squash in even layer over 1 tortilla. Add 1 tablespoon oil to skillet. Add beans, 1/4 cup salsa, garlic, and chili powder. Using potato masher, crush until beans are coarsely mashed; season with salt and pepper. Stir in 1/4 cup salsa. Spread over second tortilla. Sprinkle cheese over third tortilla. Leave fourth tortilla plain.
Broil tortillas until cheese melts and vegetables are browned in spots, about 3 minutes, watching to prevent burning. Transfer black bean tortilla to plate; sprinkle 1/4 cup chopped cilantro over. Top with cheese tortilla, squash tortilla, then plain tortilla. Cut into 4 wedges. Garnish with sour cream, salsa, and cilantro sprigs.

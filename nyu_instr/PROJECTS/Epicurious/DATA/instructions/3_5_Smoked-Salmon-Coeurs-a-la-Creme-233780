Blend cheeses, heavy cream, lime juice, salt, and cayenne in a blender until smooth. Transfer cheese mixture to a bowl, then stir in salmon and chives until just combined.
Line each mold with a single layer of rinsed and squeezed cheesecloth, leaving a 1-inch overhang. Pack salmon mixture into molds. (It will mound slightly.) Fold overhanging cheesecloth over tops. Transfer molds to a plate and chill, covered, at least 3 and up to 24 hours.

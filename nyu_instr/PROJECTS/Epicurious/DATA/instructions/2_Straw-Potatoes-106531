Peel potatoes and cut lengthwise into 1/8-inch-thick julienne with slicer, then submerge in a large bowl of ice water. Rinse potatoes in several changes of cold water in bowl until water is clear. Drain in a colander, then spread out on several layers of paper towels and pat dry. Transfer potatoes to a large rack to air-dry15 minutes.
While potatoes are drying, heat oil in a 5- to 6-quart heavy pot over moderately high heat until it registers 375°F on thermometer. Fry potatoes in 8 batches, stirring, until crisp and golden, 45 seconds to 1 minute per batch, transferring with a slotted spoon to dry paper towels to drain and seasoning with salt. Return oil to 375°F between batches.

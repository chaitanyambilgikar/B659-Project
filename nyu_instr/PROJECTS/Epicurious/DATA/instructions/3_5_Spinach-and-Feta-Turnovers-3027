Preheat oven to 425°F. Lightly grease heavy large baking sheet. Whisk eggs in large bowl to blend. Transfer 1 tablespoon beaten eggs to small bowl and reserve for glaze. Mix spinach, cheese, mint, garlic and pepper into remaining eggs in large bowl.
Unfold dough on prepared baking sheet. Gently stretch dough to 11-inch square. Cut dough into 4 equal squares. Spoon 1/4 of spinach filling (about 1/3 cup) into center of each dough square. Fold 1 corner of each square over filling to opposite corner, forming triangle. Press dough edges together tightly with fork to seal. Using sharp knife, cut 3 small slits in top of each turnover to allow steam to escape. Brush tops of turnovers with reserved egg glaze.
Bake turnovers until filling is cooked through and tops are golden brown, about 15 minutes. Serve warm.

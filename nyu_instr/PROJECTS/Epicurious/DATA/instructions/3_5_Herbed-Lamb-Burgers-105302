Gently mix first 5 ingredients in medium bowl. Sprinkle with salt and pepper; mix again. Form mixture into four 2-inch-diameter 1/2-inch-thick patties.
Stir yogurt and cumin in medium bowl to blend. Set aside.
Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Grill patties to desired doneness, about 5 minutes per side for medium. Wrap pitas in foil; grill until heated through. Unwrap pitas; transfer to 2 plates. Fill each pita half with 1 patty. Serve, passing cumin-yogurt separately.

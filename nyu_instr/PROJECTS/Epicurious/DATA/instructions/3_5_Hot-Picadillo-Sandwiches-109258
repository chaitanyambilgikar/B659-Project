Heat heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add meat and onion; cook until meat loses pink color, breaking up with fork, about 5 minutes. Spoon off excess fat. Mix in chili powder and cinnamon; cook 1 minute. Stir in tomatoes with juice, beef broth, raisins, vinegar, and tomato paste. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer uncovered until liquids thicken, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
Lightly toast rolls. Divide meat mixture among roll bottoms; top with lettuce and roll tops and serve.

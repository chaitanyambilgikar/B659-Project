Cook fettuccine in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally.
Meanwhile, heat oil in heavy small skillet over medium-low heat. Add peppers and stir until heated through.
Drain fettuccine well. Return to pot. Mix in peppers and pesto. Season with salt and pepper. Serve, passing cheese.

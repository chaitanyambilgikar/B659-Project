Toss pear cubes with 4 tablespoons brown sugar, lemon juice, and lemon peel.
Preheat oven to 250°F. Melt 1/2 teaspoon butter in medium skillet over medium heat. Place 1 crepe in skillet and warm on 1 side. Using spatula, turn crepe over and cook until warm on second side, about 30 seconds. Sprinkle crepe with 1 teaspoon brown sugar, then fold crepe into quarters. Transfer folded crepe to baking sheet; keep warm in oven. Repeat warming, sugaring, and folding with remaining butter, crepes, and brown sugar.
Transfer 2 crepes to each of 6 plates. Top crepes on each plate with 1 large spoonful of pear mixture and dollop with a tablespoon of crème fraîche or sour cream.

Prepare raw vegetables: Trim fennel stalks flush with bulb, discarding stalks, and trim any discolored spots from bulb. Quarter bulb lengthwise and cut out most of cores, leaving enough to keep pieces intact. Cut quarters lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick slices.
Separate endive leaves.
Wrap all raw vegetables separately in damp paper towels and chill in sealed plastic bags.
Prepare cooked vegetables: Have ready a large bowl of ice and cold water. Cook beans in a large pot of boiling salted water until crisp-tender, about 4 minutes. Transfer beans to ice water with a slotted spoon to cool, then transfer to a colander to drain.
Add cauliflower to boiling water and cook until crisp-tender, about 4 minutes. Transfer to ice water to cool, then transfer to colander to drain.
Add turnips to boiling water and cook until crisp-tender, about 7 minutes. Transfer to ice water to cool, then drain in colander. Cook potatoes about 30 minutes.
Before serving: Steam potatoes in a large steamer over boiling water, covered, until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Serve hot or warm.
Arrange raw and cooked vegetables on a platter and serve with aâ€¯oli .

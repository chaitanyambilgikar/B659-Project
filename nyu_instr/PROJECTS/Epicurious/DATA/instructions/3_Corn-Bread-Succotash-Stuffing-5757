Place Old-fashioned Corn Bread on baking sheet. Let stand uncovered overnight to dry. Transfer to large bowl.
Melt butter in large skillet over medium heat. Add onions, red bell peppers and celery. Sauté until tender, about 15 minutes. Transfer sautéed vegetables to medium bowl. Mix in lima beans, corn kernels, herbs, salt and pepper. (Corn bread and vegetables can be made 1 day ahead. Cover separately. Store bread at room temperature; chill vegetables.)
Preheat oven to 350°F. Lightly butter 8-inch square baking dish. Stir vegetables, chicken broth and egg into corn bread. Reserve 10 cups stuffing for turkey; transfer remainder to prepared dish. Cover and bake stuffing alongside turkey until heated through, about 30 minutes.

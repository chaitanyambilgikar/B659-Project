Melt the butter in a large, heavy skillet over medium heat. If the endives are quite fat, cut them in half, lengthwise. If they are quite thin, leave them whole. Arrange the endives in a skillet in a single layer (don't worry if the pan is crowded — the endives will shrink to fit the pan). Season them lightly with salt, then turn so they are coated in butter. Sprinkle them with the rosemary leaves, cover, and cook until they are golden on one side, about 25 minutes. Check to be sure they aren't getting too brown. If the pan is very dry, add half the water.
Turn the endives and continue cooking until they are golden and tender through, approximately 15 minutes more, adding the additional water if necessary to keep them moist. Remove the lid of the pan and sprinkle the endives with the sugar, if using, then stir so it is evenly mixed among them. Continue cooking until any liquid has evaporated from the endives and they are tender and succulent. Taste for seasoning and serve.

Preheat oven to 450°F. Line 2 heavy large baking sheets with parchment. Blend flour, 3 tablespoons poppy seeds, baking powder and salt in large bowl of electric mixer. Add butter and beat until mixture resembles coarse meal. Whisk 1 cup milk, 2 eggs and sugar in small bowl to blend. Add to flour mixture and mix just until smooth dough forms (dough will be very sticky).
Transfer dough to generously floured work surface. Sprinkle dough lightly with flour. Gently roll out to 1/2-inch-thick round. Using 2 1/2-inch round cookie cutter, cut out scones. Transfer to baking sheets. Reroll scraps and cut out additional scones. Transfer to sheets. Whisk remaining egg and 1 tablespoon milk in small bowl. Brush mixture over scones. Sprinkle with additonal poppy seeds.
Bake scones until golden brown, about 12 minutes. Cool on rack. Serve warm or at room temperature.

Have the leg cut without chops attached and with the shank bone left intact, not cracked as one finds so often. The leg should be well trimmed and all excess fat and the membrane removed. Rub it with freshly ground pepper and a touch of rosemary and place it on a rack in a shallow pan. Roast in a 325°F. oven until it registers 130°F. - 135°F. when tested with a meat thermometer. Salt well 15 minutes before removing from the oven. Allow to stand about 10 minutes before carving.
Serve with the pan juices and tiny buttered peas. Drink a very light red wine - a Moulin-a-vent, young and fruity, would be extremely good.

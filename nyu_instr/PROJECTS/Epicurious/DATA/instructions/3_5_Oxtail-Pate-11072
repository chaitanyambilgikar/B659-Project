Discard the fat and bones from the oxtails and transfer the meat to a food processor. In a skillet cook the onion in 2 tablespoons of the butter over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until it is golden, add it to the meat with the remaining 4 tablespoons butter, the orange juice, the peppercorns, the bouillon or broth, the cloves, and the salt, and pulse the motor until the pâté is minced but not puréed. Pack the pâté into a crock. The pâté may be made 3 days in advance and kept covered and chilled. Serve the pâté at room temperature with the bread.

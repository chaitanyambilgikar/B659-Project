Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350°F. Butter a 9-inch springform pan.
Whisk together flour, ginger, and cinnamon in a medium bowl until blended.
Beat together butter and brown sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer at high speed until pale and fluffy, about 5 minutes.
Whisk together molasses and boiling water in another large (at least 2-quart) bowl, then whisk in baking soda (mixture will bubble up and expand).
Add flour and molasses mixtures alternately to butter mixture in 3 batches, mixing at medium speed until incorporated. Beat in eggs until smooth. (Batter will be thin.)
Pour batter into springform pan and bake until a wooden pick or skewer inserted in center comes out clean, 55 to 65 minutes. Cool in pan on a rack 10 minutes, then remove side of pan and continue to cool cake on rack at least 30 minutes more. Serve warm.

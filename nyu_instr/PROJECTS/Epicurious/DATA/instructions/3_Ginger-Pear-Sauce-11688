Peel, core, and finely chop fresh pears. In a saucepan simmer fresh pears, nectar, dried pears, sugar, butter, ginger, lemon juice, cinnamon stick, and a pinch of salt until pears are tender, about 25 minutes. Remove pan from heat and stir in vanilla. Discard cinnamon stick.
Force pear mixture through a food mill or ricer, or in a food processor purée to desired consistency.

Make Caesar mayonnaise: Chop parsley and mash garlic to a paste with salt. In a bowl stir together parsley, garlic paste, and remaining mayonnaise ingredients and season with salt if necessary. Mayonnaise may be made 1 week ahead and chilled, covered.
Trim beans and have ready a large bowl of ice and cold water. In a large kettle of boiling salted water blanch green beans and wax beans separately 2 minutes, or until colors brighten but beans are still crisp, transferring to ice water to stop cooking. (Do not blanch purple beans or they will lose their color.) Drain beans and pat dry. Beans may be blanched 1 day ahead and chilled in sealable plastic bags.
Trim radishes, leaving some small green leaves attached.
Serve crudités with mayonnaise.

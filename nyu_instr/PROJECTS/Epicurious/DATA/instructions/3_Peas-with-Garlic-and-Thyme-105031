Cook garlic in butter in a heavy saucepan over moderately low heat, stirring, until garlic turns pale golden, about 2 minutes.
Add peas, water, and thyme and simmer briskly, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until liquid is evaporated and peas are tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in salt and season with pepper.

Melt 3 tablespoons butter in large pot over medium-high heat. Add green onions and sauté until beginning to soften, about 2 minutes. Add next 5 ingredients. Bring to boil. Add mussels. Cover pot and increase heat to high. Cook until mussels open, 5 to 6 minutes.
Divide mussels among bowls (discard any mussels that do not open). Boil juices in pot to reduce slightly, about 1 minute. Whisk in remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper. Spoon sauce over mussels; serve.

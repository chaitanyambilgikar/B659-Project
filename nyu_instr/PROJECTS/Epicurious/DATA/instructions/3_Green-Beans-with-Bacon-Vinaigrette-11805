In a kettle of boiling salted water cook beans until al dente, about 3 minutes. Drain beans in a colander and plunge into a bowl of ice and cold water to stop cooking. Drain beans well.
In a large heavy skillet cook bacon over moderate heat until crisp and transfer to paper towels to drain. Crumble bacon.
Pour off all but 1 tablespoon fat from skillet and cook beans with vinegar and half of bacon over moderate heat, tossing, until tender. Season beans with salt and pepper and serve topped with remaining bacon.

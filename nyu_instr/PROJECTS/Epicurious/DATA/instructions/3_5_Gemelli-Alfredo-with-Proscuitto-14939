Fill a 4-quart kettle three fourths full with salted water and bring to a boil for cooking pasta.
Chop prosciutto. In a skillet heat oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and sauté prosciutto, stirring, until it begins to brown, about 2 minutes. With a slotted spoon transfer prosciutto to paper towels to drain.
Boil pasta until al dente and drain in a colander. Return pasta to kettle and add remaining ingredients except prosciutto and salt to taste. Cook pasta over low heat, stirring, until butter is melted and sauce coats pasta.
Serve pasta sprinkled with prosciutto.

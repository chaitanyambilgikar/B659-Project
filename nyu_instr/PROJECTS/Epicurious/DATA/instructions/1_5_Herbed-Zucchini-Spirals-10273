Using a mandoline or similar slicing device cut the zucchini lengthwise into 1/8-inch slices. Arrange the slices on a steamer rack set over simmering water and steam them, covered, for 3 to 5 minutes, or until they are just tender. (The zucchini slices should be barely flexible enough to roll. They will soften more as they cool.) In a food processor purée the parsley, the garlic, the walnuts, 2 tablespoons of the Parmesan, and salt to taste until the mixture is smooth. Arrange the zucchini slices on a work surface and dot each slice along its length with a heaping teaspoon of the purée. Roll up each slice jelly-roll fashion and fasten the spirals with wooden picks, Arrange the spirals in a shallow baking dish, sprinkle them with the remaining 1 tablespoon Parmesan, and bake them in the upper third of a preheated 425°F. oven for 5 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and the spirals are heated through.

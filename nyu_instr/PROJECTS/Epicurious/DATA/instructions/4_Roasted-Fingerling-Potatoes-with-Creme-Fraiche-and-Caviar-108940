Preheat oven to 400°F. Combine potatoes, 2 tablespoons oil, and rosemary in large bowl. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and toss to coat. Brush large rimmed baking sheet with 1 tablespoon oil. Arrange potatoes, cut side down, in single layer on prepared sheet. Shake pan slightly to prevent sticking. Roast until potatoes are brown, crisp, and cooked through, about 35 minutes. Cool 10 minutes on sheet. Place bowls of crème fraîche and caviar on large platter. Arrange potatoes, cut side up, around bowls and serve.

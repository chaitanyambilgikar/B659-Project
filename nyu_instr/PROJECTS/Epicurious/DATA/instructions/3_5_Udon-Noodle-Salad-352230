Combine all dressing ingredients with 1/4 cup water in a blender; set aside. Coat a large skillet or wok with cooking spray; heat over high heat and add 1 1/2 teaspoons oil. When oil is hot, cook tofu and scallions 1 minute, then turn tofu once; cook 1 to 2 minutes more. Transfer tofu to a cutting board, cut into 1/2-inch cubes and place in a bowl with scallions. Add remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons oil to skillet. Stir in broccoli, edamame and mushrooms. Reduce heat to medium; cook, stirring often, 3 to 4 minutes. Add broth. Cover and cook until vegetables are tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in peas, salt and pepper. Add noodles and vegetable mixture to tofu mixture. Toss with dressing to coat.

Stir together ricotta, parmesan, salami, yolks, salt, pepper, and 3 tablespoons bread crumbs until combined. Put remaining 1/2 cup bread crumbs in a shallow bowl.
Line a large baking sheet with wax paper. Scoop a 1 1/2-tablespoon mound of ricotta mixture into bread crumbs, turning to coat completely, then pat into a 1/2-inch-thick oval with your hands and transfer to baking sheet. Make more ricotta fritters in same manner, arranging in 1 layer.
Heat 1/2 inch oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until thermometer registers 350°F. Fry half of fritters, gently turning over once with 2 spoons, until golden, 2 to 4 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain. Return oil to 350°F, then fry remaining fritters in same manner. Serve warm or at room temperature.

Blanch broccoli rabe in 2 batches in a large pot of boiling salted water (2 tablespoons salt for 6 quarts water) until stems are crisp-tender, 2 to 3 minutes, then drain well and pat dry.
Heat oil with red-pepper flakes in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers, then sauté broccoli rabe with 1/2 teaspoon salt until well coated, about 2 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.

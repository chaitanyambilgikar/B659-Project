Chop scallions, reserving white and dark green parts separately.
Cook scallion whites and garlic in oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until garlic is pale golden, about 3 minutes. Stir in cabbage, 3/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and sauté 1 minute. Add water and cook, tightly covered, until cabbage is wilted, about 3 minutes. Add scallion greens and cook, uncovered, stirring, until most of water has evaporated and cabbage is tender, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.

Bring butter, brown sugar, and corn syrup to a boil in a 1- to 1 1/2-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat, stirring. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly, until dough is slightly thickened, about 1 minute. Stir in cinnamon, cardamom, and salt and cool to warm, 15 to 20 minutes.
While dough cools, put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 375°F. Lightly butter a large baking sheet.
Drop teaspoons of dough about 3 inches apart onto baking sheet and pat each into a 2 1/2-inch round with your fingertips. Bake until golden and most of bubbling has subsided, 6 to 8 minutes (cookies will spread to about 3 inches).
Let cookies stand on baking sheet until just firm enough to hold their shape, about 2 minutes. Gently loosen cookies 1 at a time with offset spatula and immediately drape over rolling pin. (If cookies become too brittle to drape onto rolling pin, return baking sheet to oven for a few seconds to soften.) Cool cookies completely on rolling pin, about 1 minute, then transfer to a platter. Make and shape more cookies with remaining dough.

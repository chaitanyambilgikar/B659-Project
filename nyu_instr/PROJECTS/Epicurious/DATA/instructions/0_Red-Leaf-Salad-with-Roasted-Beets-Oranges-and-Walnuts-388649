1. Heat the oven to 350∞F. Lay the beets on one half of a large piece of aluminum foil. Sprinkle with olive oil and season with salt. Fold the foil in half to make a packet and roll the edges to seal. Lay on a baking sheet and roast until tender, 45 to 60 minutes. Let cool. Peel the beets and slice into 1/2-inch-thick wedges.
2. Keep the oven at 350∞F; toast the walnuts on a baking sheet for a few minutes, 5 to 7, until they smell good. Remove the nuts and let them cool while you wash and dry the lettuce and tear it into a salad bowl.
3. Zest one orangeóyou need 1 teaspoon grated zest. Using a very sharp knife, cut the ends from the oranges, slicing just deep enough to expose the flesh. Cut off the remaining peel and pith. Then, working over a bowl, remove the segments, cutting between the membrane. Place the segments in a strainer to drain off excess juice.
4. Whisk together the dressing ingredientsóthe shallot, fennel seeds, and lemon juiceóin a small bowl, adding the oil last, whisking as you pour it in so the dressing emulsifies a bit. Taste and adjust the seasoning.
5. Toss the nuts, beets, oranges, and the dressing with the salad, adjust the seasoning, and serve immediately.
Tips and Techniques Teresa: "The oranges and beets are best tossed in at the last minute, when you dress the salad to serve it, lest the o‚Äêjuice and beety color run amok."

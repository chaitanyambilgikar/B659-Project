Mash butter and 2 tablespoons dill in a small bowl. Season dill butter with salt and pepper. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 week ahead. Cover and chill.
Place potatoes in a large pot. Cover with cold water by 1"; season with salt. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium and simmer gently until tender, 10-12 minutes. Drain.
Transfer hot potatoes to a medium bowl; add dill butter and 1 tablespoon water. Toss, adding water by teaspoonfuls as needed, until butter lightly coats potatoes with a glossy sauce. Season with salt and pepper and transfer to a serving bowl. Garnish with more dill and caraway seeds, if desired.

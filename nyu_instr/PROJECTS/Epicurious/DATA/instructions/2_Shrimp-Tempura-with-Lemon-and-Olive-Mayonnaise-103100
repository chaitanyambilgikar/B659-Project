Pour enough oil into heavy large pot to reach depth of 3 inches. Heat oil over medium-high heat to 380°F. Whisk 3/4 cup ice water, egg and pinch of salt in medium bowl until frothy. Add flour and stir with whisk just until blended and small lumps remain.
Working in batches, immediately dip shrimp into tempura batter to coat; shake excess batter back into bowl. Add shrimp to hot oil and fry until shrimp curl and coating is crisp, about 3 minutes. Using tongs, transfer shrimp to paper towels; drain. Sprinkle with salt.
Transfer shrimp tempura to platter; serve shrimp immediately with Lemon and Olive Mayonnaise.

Poach chicken: In a 1 1/2-quart saucepan bring water to a boil with gingerroot, Scotch, and salt to taste. Add chicken and simmer, covered, 12 minutes, or until just cooked through. Transfer chicken with tongs to a bowl and chill, covered, 20 minutes.
Make sauce while chicken is cooling: In a bowl stir together sauce ingredients until sugar is dissolved.
Halve chicken and cut across grain into thin slices. Spoon sauce over chicken and sprinkle with coriander.

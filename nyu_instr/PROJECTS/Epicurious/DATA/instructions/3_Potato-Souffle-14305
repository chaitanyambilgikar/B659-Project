Preheat oven to 400°F. and lightly grease a 2-quart soufflé or baking dish.
Peel potatoes and quarter. In a large saucepan cover potatoes with salted cold water by 1-inch and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain potatoes and while still warm force through a ricer or medium disk of a food mill into a bowl. Beat in remaining ingredients with salt and pepper to taste until combined well.
Transfer potato mixture to prepared dish and bake 40 to 45 minutes, or until top is pale golden.

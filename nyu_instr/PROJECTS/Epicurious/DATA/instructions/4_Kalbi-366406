Place short ribs in a resealable plastic bag; pour Korean BBQ Marinade over. Seal bag; turn to coat and chill 3 hours. Let come to room temperature before grilling. Drain and pat dry with paper towels.
Build a medium fire in a charcoal grill, or heat a gas grill to medium-high. Grill 2-3 minutes per side, or until just cooked through.
Transfer to a platter and let rest 5-10 minutes. Garnish with thinly sliced scallions.

To prepare the filling: 1. In a medium skillet over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a medium mixing bowl and cool.
2. Add the tuna, capers, cheese, and parsley to the onions. Season with salt and pepper to taste and stir to combine. Set aside.
To assemble: 1. In a wide, high-sided skillet over medium-high heat, add enough oil to come up the sides of the pan about 1 1/2 inches. Heat the oil to 350°F for frying.
2. Quickly spread the egg roll wrappers out on a work surface and brush the edges with the egg white. Place a rounded spoonful of filling (2 to 3 tablespoons) just off center on each wrapper. Using a spoon, press a well into the center of the filling. Break an egg over each portion of filling, catching it in the well.
3. Carefully fold each egg roll over to form a triangle, keeping the egg inside its well. Press the edges together to seal closed. For a sturdier pocket, fold each rim over itself by about a 1/2 inch and press to seal.
4. Working in batches, gently slide the briks into the hot oil. Spoon hot oil over any dough that may not be submerged. Fry, turning gently as needed, until the briks are golden brown and crispy, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain the cooked briks on a cooling rack set over a sheet pan while the others finish cooking. Serve warm with wedges of lemon.

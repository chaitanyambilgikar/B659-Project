Peel broccoli stems with a vegetable peeler, then, keeping stems separate, cut stems, leaves, and florets diagonally into 1-inch pieces. Cook stem pieces in an 8-quart pot of (unsalted) boiling water 1 minute, then add leaves and florets and cook, stirring occasionally, until stems are crisp-tender, about 2 minutes more. Drain in a colander and rinse under cold running water to stop cooking. Drain broccoli well.
Stir together chicken broth, cornstarch, sesame oil, sugar, salt, pepper, and 2 1/2 tablespoons rice wine in a bowl until combined well.
Heat wok over high heat until a bead of water dropped onto cooking surface evaporates immediately. Add 2 1/4 teaspoons oil, swirling it around wok. Add crabmeat and stir-fry 30 seconds. Add remaining 2 tablespoons rice wine, then stir-fry 30 seconds more and transfer to a bowl.
Add remaining 2 1/4 teaspoons oil to wok and heat until it begins to smoke. Add scallion and ginger and stir-fry until fragrant, about 10 seconds. Stir sauce, then add to wok and simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened, 1 to 2 minutes. Add broccoli and crabmeat, then toss lightly to combine and transfer to a platter. Serve immediately.

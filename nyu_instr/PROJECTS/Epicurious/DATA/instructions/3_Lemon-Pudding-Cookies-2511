Preheat oven to 350°F. Grease 2 large cookie sheets. Mix first 4 ingredients in large bowl until dough forms. Roll dough into 1-inch balls. Place balls 2 inches apart on prepared cookie sheets. Dip flat-bottom glass into sugar. Press glass onto dough ball and flatten into 1/4-inch-thick cookie. Repeat with remaining cookies. Bake until just golden brown on edges, about 10 minutes. Transfer to racks and cool completely. (Can be prepared 3 days ahead. Store cookies in airtight container.)

Preheat oven to 450°F with rack in middle.
Blend together flour, lard, and salt in a bowl with your fingertips or a pastry blender just until mixture resembles coarse meal with some small (roughly pea-size) lumps of lard.
Drizzle water evenly over mixture. Gently stir with a fork until incorporated, then bring dough together with your hands. Divide dough in half, then flatten each piece into a 4-inch square. Let dough stand a few minutes before rolling out.
Roll out 1 piece of dough (keep remaining piece chilled) on a floured surface with a lightly floured rolling pin into a 12-inch square, then fit into an 8-inch square (2-inch-deep) baking pan.
Chill bottom crust while rolling out remaining piece of dough for top crust in same manner.
Whisk together 1 cup sugar with cornstarch.
Fill dough-lined pan with blackberries and top with butter, then sprinkle sugar mixture evenly over fruit. Cover top with remaining dough and press edges together to seal, then fold dough under. Using handle of a dinner knife, make a decorative edge. Brush top crust with milk and sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoons sugar. Cut 3 steam vents with a small sharp knife.
Put cobbler in oven and reduce temperature to 425°F. Bake until crust is golden-brown and filling is bubbling in center, about 45 minutes (check after 25 minutes; if crust is browning too quickly, cover with foil). Cool to warm, about 45 minutes.

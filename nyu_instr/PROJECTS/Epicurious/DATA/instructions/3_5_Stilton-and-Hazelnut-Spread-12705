In a food processor blend the Stilton, the cream cheese, the Port, and salt and pepper to taste until the mixture is smooth, add the 1/3 cup hazelnuts, and pulse the motor a few times, until the nuts are incorporated. Transfer the spread to a crock or ramekin and chill it, covered, until it is firm. (The spread may be made 3 days in advance and kept covered and chilled). Garnish the spread with the additional nuts and serve it with the Melba toast.
To toast and skin hazelnuts: Preheat oven to 350°F.
In a baking pan toast hazelnuts in one layer in oven 10 to 15 minutes, or until colored lightly, and skins blister. Wrap nuts in a kitchen towel and let steam 1 minute. Rub nuts in towel to remove as much of skins as possible and cool.

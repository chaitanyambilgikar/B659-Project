In a medium saucepan, heat the oil and cook the onion and celery over medium heat until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the anise seeds and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the celery seeds and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds. Stir in the mustard until dissolved, then stir in the remaining ingredients. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until lightly thickened, 15 to 20 minutes.
The sauce can be made up to a month ahead and refrigerated. Return to room temperature before brushing on during last 20 minutes of grilling.

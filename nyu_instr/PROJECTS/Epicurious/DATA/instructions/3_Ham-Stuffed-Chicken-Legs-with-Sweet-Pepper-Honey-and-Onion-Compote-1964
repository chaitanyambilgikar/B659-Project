For compote: Combine all ingredients except broth in heavy medium saucepan. Cover and cook over medium heat until vegetables begin to soften, stirring often, about 5 minutes. Add broth; cover and simmer until vegetables are tender, stirring occasionally, about 25 minutes.
Transfer 1 cup compote to food processor and puree until almost smooth. Add puree to remaining compote; simmer 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. (can be made 2 days ahead. Chill.)
For chicken: Combine ham, egg and whipping cream in processor and process until ham is finely chopped.
Pound each chicken leg between sheets of waxed paper to 1/3-inch-thick rectangle (about 6 inches by 5 inches). Arrange, smooth side down, on work surface. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Divide ham filling among chicken pieces. Spread over center of chicken, leaving 1/2-inch border on short sides. Starting at 1 long side, roll up chicken jelly roll style.
Place four 9x7-inch foil squares on work surface; butter foil. Place 1 chicken roll in center of each. Roll up foil tightly around chicken, enclosing completely. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover; chill.)
Preheat oven to 500°F. Place chicken on baking sheet. Bake until chicken is cooked through, about 25 minutes. Remove foil from chicken. Cut chicken roll into 3/4-inch-thick slices.
Rewarm compote over medium heat, stirring often. Spoon onto plates. Arrange chicken atop compote. Top with parsley.

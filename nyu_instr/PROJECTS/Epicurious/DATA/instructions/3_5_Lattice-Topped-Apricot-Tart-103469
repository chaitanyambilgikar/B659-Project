for filling: Combine 1 pound apricots and 3 tablespoons water in heavy large saucepan. Bring to boil, stirring often. Cover; cook over medium heat until apricots are almost tender, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes. Stir in sugar; cook uncovered until apricots are very tender, liquid evaporates and mixture thickens, about 10 minutes. Cool filling slightly. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover; chill.)
for crust: Mix flour, sugar and salt in medium bowl to blend. Add butter. Rub in with fingertips until coarse crumbs form. Using fork, mix in yolks. Transfer to work surface. Knead gently just until dough comes together. Divide dough into 2 pieces, using 2/3 of dough for 1 piece and remaining 1/3 for second piece. Flatten into disks. Wrap each disk in plastic. Let stand at room temperature 30 minutes.
Position rack in bottom third of oven and preheat to 350°F. Press larger dough disk onto bottom and up sides of 9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom. Roll out second dough disk on parchment paper to 8-inch round. Cut dough into 1/2-inch-wide strips. Chill while filling tart. Spread apricot preserves evenly over bottom of unbaked crust. Spoon apricot filling over preserves. Arrange 1/2 pound apricot wedges atop filling. Arrange dough strips atop filling to form lattice. Trim ends of strips at tart pan edges. Brush lattice with egg glaze.
Bake tart until crust is golden brown and fruit just bubbles, about 1 hour 10 minutes. Cool on rack 45 minutes. Using small knife, gently loosen tart from pan sides. Remove sides. Serve slightly warm or at room temperature.

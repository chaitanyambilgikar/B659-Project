Preheat broiler. Sprinkle veal chops and tomatoes with salt and pepper. Place chops on rimmed baking sheet. Scatter tomatoes around chops. Broil chops and tomatoes until chops are medium-rare and tomatoes are slightly charred, about 5 minutes per side. Let rest 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, melt 1 tablespoon butter in heavy small saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic and sauté until soft but not brown, about 1 minute. Add wine and boil until reduced by half, about 2 minutes. Whisk in remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Stir in caper berries, lemon juice, olives, and oregano; stir to heat through. Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.
Place 1 chop on each of 4 plates. Divide tomatoes among plates. Spoon sauce over and serve.

Using vegetable peeler, remove peel (orange part only) from orange, forming long spiral strip. Transfer peel to heavy large pot. Halve orange; squeeze juice into pot. Add next 5 ingredients. Boil over high heat 3 minutes. Add pears, reduce heat to medium, cover, and simmer until pears are tender, turning pears occasionally, about 45 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer pears to large bowl. Simmer liquid uncovered in pot until reduced to 4 cups, about 10 minutes. Pour liquid over pears; cool. Chill until cold, at least 4 hours. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Keep chilled.)
Place 1 pear in each of 6 shallow bowls. Pour liquid over pears and serve.

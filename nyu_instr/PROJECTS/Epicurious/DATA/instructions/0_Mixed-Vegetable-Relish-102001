Cut out the stem and end of the tomatoes. Grind all the vegetables together in a meat grinder, using the coarsest blade. Place in a large bowl. Cover with well-salted water and let stand overnight. The next day pour vegetables and brine into a large pot, bring to a broil and drain. Mix flour, sugar, turmeric and mustard in a pot, add the vinegar and cook over a medium heat, stirring constantly, until thickened. Add drained vegetables. Cook over low heat until mixture is fairly thick and vegetables tender. Ladle into hot, sterilized preserving jars, cover and seal.

Sprinkle gelatin over water in a small heatproof cup and let stand 1 minute to soften. Stir together persimmon purée, sugar, lemon juice, and a pinch of salt in a bowl until sugar is dissolved.
Melt softened gelatin in cup set in a saucepan of simmering water, then stir into persimmon purée. Beat cream in another bowl with an electric mixer until it just holds stiff peaks, then gently fold into purée. Divide fool among 4 stemmed glasses and chill, covered, at least 8 hours (it will set softly).
Just before serving, peel Fuyu persimmons, seeding if necessary, and chop. Top fool with chopped persimmons.

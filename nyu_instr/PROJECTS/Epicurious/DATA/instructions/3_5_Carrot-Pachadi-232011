Drain yogurt in a large fine-mesh sieve set over a bowl about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, finely shred carrots using food processor.
Heat oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then add mustard seeds and cook, covered, until they make popping sounds, about 15 seconds. Add curry leaves and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 3 seconds. Add carrots, onion, cumin, salt, and cayenne and cook over moderate heat, stirring frequently, until carrots are crisp-tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a shallow bowl and cool about 30 minutes. Stir in yogurt and cilantro.

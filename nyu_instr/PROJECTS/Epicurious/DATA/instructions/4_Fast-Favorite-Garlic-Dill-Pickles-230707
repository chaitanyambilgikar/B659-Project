1. Cut a thin slice from the ends of each cucumber
2. Meanwhile, combine vinegar, water, and salt in a saucepan and bring to a boil.
3. Remove hot jars from canner. Place 1 head fresh dill or 1 tsp (5 mL) dill seeds and 1 clove garlic into each jar; pack in cucumbers. Pour boiling vinegar mixture over cucumbers to within 1/2 inch (1 cm) of rim (head space). Process 10 minutes for pint (500 mL) jars and 15 minutes for quart (1 L) jars as directed for Longer Time Processing Procedure.
Tip: Garlic may turn blue or green in the jar. Nothing to be alarmed about, it is only the effect of the acid on the natural pigments in the garlic.

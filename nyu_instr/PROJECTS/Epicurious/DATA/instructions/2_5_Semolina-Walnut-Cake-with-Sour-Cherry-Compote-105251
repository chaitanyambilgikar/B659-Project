Make cake: Preheat oven to 350°F.
Pulse flours, 1 cup walnuts, and salt in a food processor until nuts are finely chopped.
Beat together butter, sugar, and zest in a large bowl with an electric mixer until pale and fluffy. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in nut flour and spread batter evenly in a buttered 8-inch square metal pan. Sprinkle evenly with remaining 1/3 cup walnuts.
Bake in middle of oven until golden and a tester comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Transfer pan to a rack. Make syrup while cake bakes:
Simmer all syrup ingredients in a 1-quart saucepan, stirring until sugar is dissolved, 10 to 15 minutes, or until slightly thickened. Finish cake:
Evenly brush warm syrup over hot cake and cool completely in pan on rack. Cut into diamonds.

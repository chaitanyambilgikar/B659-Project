Stir together olives, oil, zest, and 2 tablespoons parsley in a bowl.
Arrange catfish, skinned sides down, in an oiled 12-inch nonstick skillet, tucking thinner ends of each fillet under. Season fish with salt and pepper, then mound olive mixture on top. Put a round of parchment or wax paper on top of olive mixture, then tightly cover skillet.
Cook catfish over moderate heat until just cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes. Serve sprinkled with remaining tablespoon parsley.

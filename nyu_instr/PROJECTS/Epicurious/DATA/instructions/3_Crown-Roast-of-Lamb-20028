Fill the center of the roast with a ball of foil to keep the crown in shape during roasting, and cover the bones with foil or cubes of fat to prevent them from charring. Season the roast well with freshly ground black pepper and tarragon, and roast on a rack in a 325°F. oven, allowing about 13-15 minutes per pound for pink lamb. With a crown it is difficult to take a reading on a meat thermometer.
Let the roast stand for about 10 minutes in a warm place. Remove the covering on the ends of the ribs and replace them with paper frills. Fill the center of the crown with any of the following:
1. Tiny new peas mixed with tiny onions, well buttered.
2. A rice pilaf mixed with finely cut and quickly sautéd lamb kidneys.
3. A purée of chestnuts, with braised chestnuts as a garnish.
4. Braised chestnuts and Brussels sprouts.
5. Sautéd mushroom caps sprinkled with tarragon, parsley and chives.
6. Cracked wheat.
7. Wild rice and almonds.
Serve the pan juices, or anchovy-flavored Hollandaise sauce of a bèarnaise sauce, substituting fresh mint for the tarragon in the latter.
Also serve a Bibb lettuce salad tossed with diced cooked beets. Drink a modest Bordeaux wine such as Chateau Grand Puy Lacoste or a Cos d'Estournel.

Wrap belacan tightly in foil and bake 10 minutes. Open foil carefully and cool belacan to room temperature, about 15 minutes. Crumble belacan into mini food processor and finely purée with chiles and shallots.
Heat oil in wok over moderate heat until hot but not smoking, then add belacan mixture and cook, stirring constantly, 3 minutes. Add shrimp and increase heat to moderately high, then cook, stirring, until beginning to turn pink, about 1 minute. Add coconut milk, stock, and salt and simmer, stirring occasionally, 2 minutes.
Increase heat to high, then add water spinach and cook, stirring, until spinach is crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Serve immediately.

1. Preheat oven to 350°F.
2. Coat acorns with 1 tablespoon peanut oil and spread on a cookie sheet. Bake for 10-15 minutes. Cool acorns.
3. Process the acorns in a food processor on high speed until finely ground. Continue processing until acorns form a thick paste.
4. Slowly add remaining peanut oil until smooth and creamy, scraping down sides and adding a little more oil as needed. Serve on Winterfell Black Bread or a bread of your choice.

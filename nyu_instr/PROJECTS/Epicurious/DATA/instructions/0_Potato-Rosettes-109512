Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 400°F.
Peel potatoes, then cut crosswise into 1/16-inch-thick slices with an adjustable-blade slicer and toss with oil.
Oil a large baking sheet. Overlap 8 to 10 slices (use larger ones) in 1 corner of baking sheet to form a 5-inch rosette, then cover center of rosette with another potato slice. Make 5 more rosettes in same manner. Season with salt and pepper.
Bake until well browned around edges, about 20 minutes. Immediately loosen from baking sheet with a thin metal spatula and flip over so browned bottom sides are on top.

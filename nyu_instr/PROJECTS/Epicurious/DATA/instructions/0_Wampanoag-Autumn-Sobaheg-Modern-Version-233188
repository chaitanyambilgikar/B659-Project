Combine the dried beans, grits, venison, salt, and 8 cups water in a large, heavy-bottomed pot. Bring the mixture to a gentle boil over medium heat. Cover the pot, reduce the heat, and keep the sobaheg at a low simmer. Cook approximately 2 hours, until the beans and venison are tender, stirring often to prevent sticking. Periodically skim off the froth that rises to the top. Stir in the squash and Jerusalem artichokes and simmer until they are done, about 30 minutes.
Add the nut flour, stirring until thoroughly blended, and serve.
*Coarse grits of flint corn (sometimes called samp in modern markets). Finely ground grits used for Southern grits just will not do. Coarse white grits, sold under the brand name Gonsalves (a Portuguese food company), are available at many gourmet stores and large supermarkets. You can also order coarse white grits from Plimoth Plantation at www.plimoth.com).
**Jerusalem artichokes, also called sunchokes, are part of the sunflower family. They are available in market produce sections in the fall and early winter. If you are unable to find them, the recipe will still be delicious.

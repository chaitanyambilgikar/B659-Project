Combine first 4 ingredients on plate. Whisk egg and 2 tablespoons water in medium bowl to blend. Whisk mayonnaise and mustard in small bowl. Dredge pork cutlets with mayonnaise-mustard mixture; dip into beaten egg, then coat cutlets with panko crumb mixture. Transfer to plate.
Heat oil in heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add pork; cook until no longer pink on inside and crumbs are golden brown, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer pork cutlets to 2 plates. Garnish with sage sprigs, if desired. Serve with lemon wedges.

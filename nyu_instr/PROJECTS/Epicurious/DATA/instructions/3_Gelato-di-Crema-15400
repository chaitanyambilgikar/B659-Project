In a saucepan, mix all the ingredients. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture lightly thickened (a finger drawn across the back of a spoon should leave a path in the custard). Do not boil. Chill custard completely. Freeze in ice-cream machine according to manufacturer's instructions. Transfer gelato to a container and place in freezer for 30 minutes to ripen and achieve the correct consistency. If gelato overfreezes, thaw slightly before serving.
Gelato will keep in the freezer for one week.

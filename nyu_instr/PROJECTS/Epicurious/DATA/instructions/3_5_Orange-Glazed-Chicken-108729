Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 450°F. Line a large shallow (1-inch-deep) baking pan with foil, then oil foil.
Stir together marmalade, mustard, soy sauce, and lemon juice in a small bowl.
Pat chicken dry and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Roast chicken, skin sides up, in baking pan until golden and just cooked through, about 30 minutes.
Turn broiler on and spoon marmalade mixture over chicken, then broil chicken until glaze is bubbling and browned, 3 to 5 minutes.

Preheat broiler.
Broil peppers in batches, skin sides up, on a broiler pan about 4 inches from heat until skins are blistered and lightly charred, 4 to 6 minutes. Transfer peppers to a large bowl and cover. Let peppers steam until cool, then peel and separate by color.
Sterilize jars and lids.
Bring vinegar, water, sugar, salt, garlic, and peppercorns to a boil in a 3-quart saucepan. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, 10 minutes.
Drain jars upside down on a clean kitchen towel 1 minute, then invert. Fill jars with pepper quarters, alternating colors. Tuck 2 garlic cloves (from pickling liquid) and 1 rosemary sprig into side of each jar. Fill jars with pickling liquid, leaving 1/4inch of space at top, then run a thin knife between vegetables and jar to eliminate air bubbles.
Seal, process, and store filled jars , boiling peppers in jars 20 minutes.
Let peppers stand in jars at least 1 week for flavors to develop.

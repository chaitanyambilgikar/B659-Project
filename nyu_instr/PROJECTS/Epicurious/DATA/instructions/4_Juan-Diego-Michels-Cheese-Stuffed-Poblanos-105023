Preheat broiler.
Broil tomatoes, onion, and garlic in a foil-lined shallow baking pan 2 to 3 inches from heat, turning frequently, until lightly charred on all sides, about 5 minutes for garlic, 12 to 15 minutes for onion and tomatoes (flesh should be soft). Alternatively, char vegetables in a hot well-seasoned griddle or cast-iron skillet over moderate heat.
Core tomatoes and peel garlic, then purée both with onion and salt in a blender until smooth (use caution when blending hot ingredients). Force through a large sieve into a bowl, discarding solids.
Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a wide 4-quart heavy pot over moderately high heat until just hot. Stir about 1/2 cup tomato sauce into oil (this reduces spattering) and, when bubbling vigorously, add remaining sauce and basil. Fry sauce, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 10 minutes.
Add grapes, plantains, and mangoes to sauce and simmer gently, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until sauce is thickened and fruit is tender but still intact, about 30 minutes. Season sauce with salt.
While sauce is simmering, preheat oven to 350°F.
Pour sauce over stuffed chiles and bake, covered with foil, until cheese is completely melted and sauce is bubbling, about 30 minutes.

Make crust: Preheat oven to 350°F with rack in middle. Invert bottom of springform pan (to make it easier to slide cake off bottom) and lock on side.
Pulse graham crackers, almonds, and sugar in a food processor until finely ground, then transfer to a bowl. Stir in butter until combined.
Press crumb mixture evenly onto bottom and 1/2 inch up side of pan.
Bake crust 8 minutes. Cool to room temperature (still in pan), about 15 minutes. Leave oven on.
Make cheesecake: Stir together ricotta, granulated sugar, zest, and egg yolk in a large bowl until combined, then stir in candied orange peel and chocolate chips.
Beat egg whites (all 5) and a pinch of salt in another bowl with an electric mixer until they hold soft peaks. Fold into ricotta mixture gently but thoroughly.
Pour filling into crust and bake until top is puffed and golden, about 55 minutes to 1 hour.
Cool in pan 15 minutes. Run a thin knife around edge to loosen cake, then remove side of pan. Cool to room temperature, about 1 hour. Dust with confectioners sugar.

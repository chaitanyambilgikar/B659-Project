1. Preheat the oven to 400°F. Scrub the potatoes well; cut into quarters lengthwise, then crosswise. Place in a bowl; toss with the oil, paprika, salt and pepper.
2. Arrange the potatoes in a single layer on a baking sheet and bake for 30 minutes, until tender, brown and crispy. Shake once during baking. Remove from the baking sheet with a metal spatula and serve on a platter. Sprinkle with a little extra salt, if desired.

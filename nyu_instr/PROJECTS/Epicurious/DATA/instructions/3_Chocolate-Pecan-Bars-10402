Make the crust: In a food processor blend together the flour, the sugar, the butter, and the salt, pulsing the motor, until the mixture resembles coarse meal, add the egg, and blend the mixture until it forms a dough. Press the dough evenly with floured hands into the bottom of a buttered 13- by 9-inch baking dish and bake it in the middle of a preheated 350°F. oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until it is golden.
Make the filling while the crust is baking: In a bowl cream the butter with the brown sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy and add the eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in the flour, the vanilla, and the salt and stir in the pecans and the chocolate chips.
Spread the filling over the crust and bake the confection in the middle of the 350°F. oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the top is golden brown. Let the confection cool completely in the dish on a rack and cut it into 24 bars. The bars may be made 2 days in advance and kept in an airtight container.

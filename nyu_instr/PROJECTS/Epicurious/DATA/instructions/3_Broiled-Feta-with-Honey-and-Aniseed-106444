Preheat broiler. Divide feta evenly among 4 broilerproof baking dishes; brush with oil. Broil until golden, about 3 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine 3 tablespoons honey and aniseed in heavy small saucepan. Stir over medium heat until hot.
Drizzle 1 teaspoon honey mixture over cheese in each dish. Sprinkle feta with ground black pepper. Serve, passing remaining honey mixture separately.

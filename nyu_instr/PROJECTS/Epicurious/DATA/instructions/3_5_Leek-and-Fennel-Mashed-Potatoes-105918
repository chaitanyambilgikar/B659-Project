Wash leeks in a bowl of water, then lift into a sieve to drain.
Cook leeks with 1/4 teaspoon salt in 1 teaspoon butter in a 10-inch nonstick skillet over moderately low heat, stirring occasionally, until soft and beginning to brown, 6 to 8 minutes, then transfer to a bowl. Reserve skillet.
Peel and quarter potatoes, then cover with salted cold water by 1 inch in a 4-quart saucepan and simmer until tender, 20 to 25 minutes.
While potatoes are simmering, cook fennel with remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt in remaining teaspoon butter in skillet over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add broth and simmer, covered, until tender, 10 to 12 minutes.
Drain potatoes and force through ricer or food mill back into saucepan. Stir in milk, leeks, fennel, and pepper.

Sift the dry ingredients together into a warmed mixing bowl. Cut the lard into the flour mixture with a pastry blender or 2 knives until it is evenly distributed. In a separate bowl, stir the yeast into the buttermilk until it is well blended, pour the liquid into the flour mixture, and stir until blended.
Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and work lightly until the mixture is smooth and evenly textured. Roll out to about 1/2-inch thick, then cut 1-inch biscuits with a clean, floured metal biscuit cutter. Place the biscuits on an ungreased sheet pan, cover with a dish towel, and allow to rise for a while. In the meantime, preheat the oven to 400°F. When the biscuits have risen by about a fourth, bake them for about 15 minutes or until the tops are lightly browned.

Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 425°F. Generously butter a 13- by 9-inch baking dish.
Whisk together half-and-half, eggs, vanilla, salt, and 2 tablespoons sugar. Arrange baguette slices in 1 layer in dish and pour custard over bread. Turn bread slices over once or twice to coat and let stand at room temperature 30 minutes. Sprinkle top evenly with remaining tablespoon sugar and bake until custard is set and top is golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes.

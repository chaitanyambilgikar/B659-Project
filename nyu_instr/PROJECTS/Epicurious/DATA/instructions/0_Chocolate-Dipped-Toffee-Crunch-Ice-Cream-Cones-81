Soften ice cream slightly in refrigerator if hard. Using small spoon, gently pack some ice cream into hollow part of each cone. Top each with rounded scoop (about 1/3 cup) of ice cream. Place each cone, ice cream side up, in small glass. Freeze overnight.
Place chopped Heath Bars on plate. Place chocolate and shortening in medium metal bowl. Set bowl over saucepan of simmering water and stir until melted and smooth. Remove bowl from over water. Let chocolate stand until cool but still liquid, about 5 minutes. Dip ice cream end of 1 cone into chocolate, rotating to coat completely and tilting bowl if necessary. Hold cone until chocolate is almost set, about 10 seconds. Immediately roll dipped portion into Heath Bars, pressing gently to adhere. Return cone to glass and place in freezer. Repeat with remaining cones, chocolate and Heath Bars. (Can be prepared 1 week ahead. Wrap each cone in plastic.) Serve frozen.

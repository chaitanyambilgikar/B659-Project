In a small bowl cream together the butter, the lemon juice, the capers, and salt and pepper to taste and spread the lemon caper butter on one side of each slice of bread. Layer half the bread slices with the salmon, the onion, the avocado, and the sprouts and top the sandwiches with the remaining bread slices, pressing them firmly.

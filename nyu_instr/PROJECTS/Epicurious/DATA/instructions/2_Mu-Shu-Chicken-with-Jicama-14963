Cut chicken into 1/4-inch-thick strips and in a shallow baking dish stir together cornstarch, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, and 1 tablespoon Sherry until combined well. Add chicken to marinade and toss to coat well. Marinate chicken, covered, at room temperature 15 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350° F.
In a bowl whisk together eggs, 1/2 teaspoon soy sauce, and salt. Peel j’cama and cut into sticks about 3 inches long and 1/4 inch thick. Cut scallions into pieces about 1 1/2 inches long and halve white pieces lengthwise.
Wrap tortillas in a sheet of foil and heat in oven until hot, about 8 minutes.
While tortillas are heating, heat a wok or an 8- to 10-inch heavy skillet (preferably cast iron) over moderately high heat until a bead of water dropped on cooking surface evaporates immediately. Add 1 1/2 tablespoons oil, swirling wok or skillet to coat evenly, and heat until hot but not smoking. Stir-fry eggs until just cooked through but not browned, about 10 seconds. Transfer eggs to a bowl and break up into bite-size pieces.
Carefully wipe out wok or skillet with paper towels. In wok or skillet heat 1 1/2 tablespoons oil until hot but not smoking. Stir-fry j’cama 30 seconds and add 1 tablespoon Sherry. Add scallions and stir-fry 10 seconds, or until j’cama is crisp-tender. Add vegetables to eggs. Add remaining 2 tablespoons oil to wok or skillet and heat until hot but not smoking. Stir-fry chicken with marinade 1 minute, or until just cooked through. Add vegetable mixture with remaining tablespoon soy sauce and reamining 1/2 tablespoon Sherry and stir-fry until heated through.
Divide chicken mixture between 2 plates and serve with tortillas for wrapping.

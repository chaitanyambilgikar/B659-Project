In a shallow dish coat the Camembert well on all sides with the egg. In another shallow dish combine the bread crumbs and the hazelnuts, coat the Camembert well on all sides with the mixture, patting the mixture on to help it adhere, and chill it on a plate, covered, for 1 hour. On a baking sheet bake the Camembert rindless side up in a preheated 400°F. oven for 15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown. Transfer the Camembert carefully to a platter and serve it hot with the apple slices and the brioche.

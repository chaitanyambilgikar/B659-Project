Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 10-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat, then sauté mushrooms, stirring occasionally, until tender and starting to brown, about 4 minutes. Add artichoke hearts and cook, stirring occasionally, 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
Brush 1 side of bread slices with remaining tablespoon olive oil. Turn over 4 slices, then divide mushroom mixture and cheese among them. Top with remaining slices, oiled sides up.
Heat a dry 12-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat until hot, then cook sandwiches, pressing occasionally and turning over once, until bread is golden brown and cheese is melted, about 5 minutes total.

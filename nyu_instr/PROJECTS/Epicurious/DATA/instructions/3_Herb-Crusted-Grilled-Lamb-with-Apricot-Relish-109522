Prepare lamb: Stir together herbs, salt, pepper, garlic, and oil, then rub all over lamb.

To cook lamb using a charcoal grill: Open vents on bottom of grill. Light charcoal (80 to 100 briquettes) in chimney starter. Leaving about one quarter of grill free of charcoal, bank lit charcoal across rest of grill so that coals are about three times higher on opposite side.
Charcoal fire is medium-hot when you can hold your hand 5 inches above rack over area where coals are piled highest for 3 to 4 seconds. Sear lamb on lightly oiled grill rack directly over hottest part of coals, uncovered, turning over once and, if necessary, moving around grill to avoid flare-ups, until well browned, 8 to 10 minutes total. Move lamb to coolest part of grill, then cover with inverted roasting pan and grill, turning over once, until thermometer inserted diagonally into center registers 135°F for medium-rare, 12 to 15 minutes. Transfer lamb to a cutting board and let stand, loosely covered with foil, 15 minutes.
To cook lamb using a gas grill: Preheat all burners on high, covered, 10 minutes. Sear lamb on lightly oiled grill rack, covered with lid, turning over once, until well browned, 8 to 10 minutes total. Turn off 1 burner (middle burner if there are 3) and put lamb above shut-off burner. Reduce heat on remaining burner(s) to moderate and grill lamb, covered with lid, until thermometer inserted diagonally into center registers 135°F for medium-rare, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer lamb to a cutting board and let stand, loosely covered with foil, 15 minutes.
Serve lamb: Thinly slice lamb across the grain and serve with relish.

Blanch snow peas in a saucepan of boiling salted water 30 seconds. Drain in a colander and rinse under cold water to stop cooking. Cut diagonally in half.
Bring dashi to a boil with cockles in a large saucepan; simmer until cockles are opened (discard any unopened cockles after 5 minutes; if using clams, discard after 7 minutes). Stir in sake and soy sauce and scatter with snow peas.

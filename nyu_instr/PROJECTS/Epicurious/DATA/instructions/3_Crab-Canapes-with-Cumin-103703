Make toasts: Preheat oven to 425°F.
Stir together oils, cumin, and salt and pepper to taste and brush on cut sides of pitas. Cut each pita half into 8 wedges and arrange, cut sides up, on a large baking sheet.
Bake pitas in middle of oven until edges are crisp, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a rack to cool (toasts will continue to crisp as they cool).
Make crab mixture while pitas are baking: Stir together crab ingredients and salt and pepper to taste.
Top each toast with some crab.

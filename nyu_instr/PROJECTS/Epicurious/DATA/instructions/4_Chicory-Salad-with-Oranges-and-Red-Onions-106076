Bring vinegar, sugar, and 1 teaspoon salt to a boil in a small saucepan, stirring frequently until sugar is dissolved, then remove from heat.
Cook onion in a saucepan of boiling salted water until crisp-tender, about 4 minutes, then drain in a colander. Rinse under cold water and drain again. Stir onion into vinegar mixture and marinate 10 minutes.
While onion is marinating, cut peel and white pith from oranges with a sharp knife, then cut oranges crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices.
Drain onion in a sieve set over a salad bowl, reserving marinade and onion separately. Whisk mustard, stock, remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, pepper, and oil into marinade. Add chicory, onion, and oranges and toss with dressing. Serve immediately.

Preheat oven to 425°F. Sprinkle large rimmed baking sheet with flour. Whisk flour, sugar, and baking powder in large bowl. Whisk 3/4 cup milk, egg, and oil in small bowl to blend. Gradually add milk mixture to dry ingredients, tossing until moist clumps form and adding more milk by tablespoonfuls if dough is dry. Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface; knead gently for several turns until dough comes together.
Pat out dough to 1-inch-thick round. Using 2 1/2-inch-diameter cutter, cut out scones. Gather dough scraps; press out to 1-inch thickness and cut out more scones. Transfer to prepared sheet.
Bake scones until golden on top and tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 14 minutes. Cool on sheet 5 minutes. Transfer to basket. Serve warm with butter, jam, and whipped cream.

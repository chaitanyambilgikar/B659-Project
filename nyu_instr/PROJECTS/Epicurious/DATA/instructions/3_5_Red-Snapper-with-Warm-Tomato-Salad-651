Mix tomato wedges, red onion, basil, dill, mint, olive oil and minced garlic in medium bowl. Season salad to taste with salt and pepper.
Cut 4 foil pieces, each large enough to enclose 1 fish fillet completely. Place foil pieces on work surface. Place 1 red snapper fillet in center of each foil piece. Season snapper fillets with salt and pepper. Top each fillet with 1/4 of tomato salad. Fold up foil around fish and salad; seal foil on all sides, enclosing fish and salad completely.
Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat) or preheat broiler. Place foil packages, folded sides up, on grill or broiler pan. Grill or broil until fish is cooked through and salad is warm, about 12 minutes. Transfer foil packages to plates; allow diners to open their own packages.

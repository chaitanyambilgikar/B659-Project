Pat chicken dry and sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt.
Heat oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then brown chicken, turning over once, about 5 minutes total. Transfer chicken with tongs to a plate. Stir garlic, curry, and cayenne into fat in skillet, then add coconut milk, tomatoes with their juice, currants, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and bring to a simmer. Add okra and chicken along with any juices accumulated on plate and briskly simmer, partially covered, until chicken is cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes. Sprinkle with cashews.

Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter 11x7-inch glass baking dish. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in heavy medium skillet over medium heat. Add chestnuts and thyme. Sauté until heated through, breaking chestnuts into 1/2-inch pieces with back of spoon, about 4 minutes. Bring milk just to simmer in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add salt, then gradually whisk in pasta flour. Reduce heat to medium. Cook until mixture is very thick, stirring constantly, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat. Add remaining 6 tablespoons butter, then 1 cup cheese, whisking until cheese melts. Whisk in egg yolks 1 at a time; stir in chestnuts. Beat egg whites in large bowl until stiff but not dry. Fold whites into warm flour mixture in 2 additions. Transfer to prepared dish; sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup cheese. Bake spoon bread until puffed and beginning to brown, about 35 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes; serve warm.

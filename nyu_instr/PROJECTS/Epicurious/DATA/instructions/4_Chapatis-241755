Stir together flour and salt in a large bowl, then make a well in center and add water to well. Using a fork, stir until a dough forms. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead, adding more flour as needed, until smooth and elastic (dough will be slightly sticky), about 8 minutes.
Transfer to a clean bowl and cover bowl with plastic wrap. Let dough stand at room temperature at least 1 hour.
Divide dough into 12 equal pieces and roll each piece into a ball, then cover with a kitchen towel (not terry cloth). Dip 1 ball of dough into additional flour, shaking off excess, then flatten ball with your hands on lightly floured surface.
Roll dough into a 5- to 6-inch round with a lightly floured rolling pin, lifting and rotating as necessary. Shake off excess flour, then transfer round to a sheet of wax paper and cover with another kitchen towel (not terry cloth). Repeat with remaining balls, arranging rounds in 1 layer (do not stack).
Heat a dry 10-inch cast-iron or heavy skillet over medium heat until hot. Lightly grease skillet with a paper towel dipped in oil, then cook one round of dough until underside is golden brown in spots, about 30 seconds. Gently turn over and cook until deep golden brown in spots, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Turn over again and cook, gently pressing with tongs, until chapati is cooked through, 30 seconds to 1 minute more. (Chapatis may puff up.)
Keep warm, wrapped in another kitchen towel, and cook remaining rounds. Serve immediately.

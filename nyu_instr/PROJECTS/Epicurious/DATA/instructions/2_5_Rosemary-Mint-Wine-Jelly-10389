In a food processor or blender blend together the mint, the rosemary, and 1 cup of the wine until the herbs are chopped fine and transfer the mixture to a bowl. In a small saucepan bring the remaining 1 cup wine to a boil, add it to the herb mixture, and let the herb mixture stand, covered, for 45 minutes. Strain the herb mixture through a sieve lined with several layers of rinsed and squeezed cheesecloth set over a large measuring cup, pressing hard on the solids,and add 1/4 cup of the lemon juice. (There should be exactly 2 cups liquid; if there is less add enough of the additional lemon juice to measure 2 cups liquid.) Transfer the liquid to a kettle, stir in the sugar, stirring until the mixture is combined well, and bring the mixture to a rolling boil over high heat, stirring constantly. Stir in the pectin quickly, bring the mixture again to a full rolling boil, stirring constantly, and boil it, stirring constantly, for 1 minute. Remove the kettle from the heat, skim off any foam with a large spoon, and ladle the mixture immediately into 4 sterilized 1/2-pint Mason-type jars, filling the jars to within 1/8 inch of the tops. Wipe the rims with a dampened cloth and seal the jars with the lids. Invert the jars for 5 minutes and turn them upright. (Instead of being inverted, the jars may be put in a water bath canner or on a rack set in a deep kettle. Add enough hot water to the canner or kettle to cover the jars by 1 to 2 inches and bring it to a boil. Process the jars, covered, for 5 minutes, transfer them with tongs to a rack, and let them cool completely.) Store the jars in a cool, dark place.

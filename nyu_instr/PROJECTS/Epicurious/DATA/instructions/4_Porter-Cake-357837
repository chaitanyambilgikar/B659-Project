Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Line the sides and base of an 8-inch high-sided round cake pan (the sides should be about 2 3/4 inches high) with wax paper.
Sift the ï¬‚our, nutmeg, pie spice, baking powder and salt into a bowl. Rub in the butter, then stir in the sugar, raisins and the candied peel.
Whisk the eggs in another bowl, add the porter or stout, then pour into the dry ingredients and mix well. Pour into the prepared pan and bake for about 2 hours in the preheated oven. If it starts to brown too quickly on top, cover it with foil or wax paper after about 1 hour. The cake is cooked when a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow it to sit in the pan for about 20 minutes before turning out and cooling on a wire rack.

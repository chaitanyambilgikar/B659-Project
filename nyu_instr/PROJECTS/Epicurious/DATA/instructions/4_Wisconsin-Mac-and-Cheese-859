Cook macaroni in medium saucepan of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite. Drain.
Meanwhile, grind bread in processor to fine crumbs; transfer to small bowl. Melt butter in medium saucepan. Mix 1/2 tablespoon into crumbs. Add flour to remaining butter; whisk over medium heat 2 minutes. Gradually whisk in milk and broth. Bring to boil, whisking constantly. Add green onions. Whisk 2 minutes longer. Remove from heat. Add cheese; stir until melted.
Preheat broiler. Mix macaroni into sauce. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Spoon into 9-inch pie plate. Sprinkle crumbs over. Broil until crumbs brown, about 2 minutes, and serve.

Bring rhubarb, sugar, and wine to a simmer in a small heavy saucepan, stirring until sugar is dissolved, then simmer, uncovered, until rhubarb is tender and begins to fall apart, about 5 minutes. Purée in a blender until smooth (use caution when blending hot liquids).
Divide strawberries among 6 stemmed glasses.
Beat eggs in a large deep metal bowl with a handheld electric mixer at medium-high speed 1 minute, then add hot rhubarb purée in a stream, beating constantly. Put bowl over a saucepan of simmering water and beat until mixture is tripled in volume, very thick, and registers 160°F on thermometer, about 6 minutes. Remove from heat and ladle sabayon over strawberries. Serve immediately.

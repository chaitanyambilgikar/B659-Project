Put 2 sprigs of fresh tarragon and a sprig of parsley into the cavity of the bird along with butter, salt and pepper. Truss the bird and then slip a few tarragon leaves under the skin of the breast, working down from the neck and being careful not to puncture the skin as you separate it from the flesh. Brush the bird with seasoned melted butter in which you have steeped a few tarragon leaves. Roast according to directions for spitted roast chicken , basting with more tarragon butter during the cooking.
Serve with tarragon butter and potatoes that have been wrapped in foil and roasted in the coals. A bowl of fresh raw vegetables is an excellent accompaniment.

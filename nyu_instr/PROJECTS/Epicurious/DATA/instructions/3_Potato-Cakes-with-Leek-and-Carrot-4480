Wrap grated potatoes in several layers of paper towels and squeeze dry. Place potatoes in large bowl. Add leek and carrot and toss to combine. Season generously with salt and pepper.
Melt 2 tablespoons butter in each of 2 heavy medium skillets over medium-low heat. Add half of vegetable mixture (about 2 cups) to each skillet. Using metal spatula, flatten vegetables in each skillet to 7- to 8-inch-diameter cake. Cover skillets and cook cakes until crisp and brown at edges, about 12 minutes. Turn cakes over. Cook uncovered until vegetables are cooked through and cakes are crisp and brown on bottom, about 5 minutes longer. (Can be prepared 3 hours ahead. Transfer to baking sheet and let stand at room temperature. Rewarm in 375°F oven until crisp, about 10 minutes.) Transfer cakes to plates. Serve with sour cream, if desired.

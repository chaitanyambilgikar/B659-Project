For shrimp: Heat oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Add garlic and stir 30 seconds. Sprinkle shrimp with salt and pepper. Add shrimp to skillet; sauté just until opaque in center, about 3 minutes. Remove skillet from heat.
For sauce: Mix butter and flour in small bowl to blend. Combine clam juice and all remaining ingredients except water in medium saucepan. Simmer 5 minutes to blend flavors. Add butter-flour mixture and whisk until sauce thickens and is smooth, thinning with water by tablespoonfuls if desired, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add sauce to shrimp in skillet; simmer until heated through, about 2 minutes.

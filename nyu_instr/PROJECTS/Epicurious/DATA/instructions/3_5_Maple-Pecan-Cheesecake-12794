Make the crust: In a bowl stir together the gingersnap crumbs and the butter until the mixture is combined well and press the mixture onto the bottom and halfway up the side of a 9-inch springform pan.
Make the filling: In a large bowl with an electric mixer cream together the cream cheese and the brown sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy and beat in the maple syrup. Add the egg yolks, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition, and beat in the sour cream, the salt, the vanilla, the maple extract, and the pecans. In a bowl with the electric mixer, beaters cleaned, beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt until they just hold stiff peaks, whisk about one fourth of them onto the cream cheese mixture, and fold in the remaining whites gently but thoroughly.
Pour the filling into the prepared crust and bake the cheesecake in the middle of a preheated 350°F. oven for 1 hour. Turn off the oven, let the cheesecake cool completely in the oven with the door ajar, and chill it, covered, overnight.

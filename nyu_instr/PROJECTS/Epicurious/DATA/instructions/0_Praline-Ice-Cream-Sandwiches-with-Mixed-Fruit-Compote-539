FOR ICE CREAM: Butter small baking sheet. Combine sugar and water in heavy small saucepan. Stir over low heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat to medium-high; boil without stirring until syrup turns deep amber, brushing sides of pan with wet pastry brush and swirling pan occasionally, about 6 minutes. Add nuts. Immediately pour onto prepared baking sheet. Cool praline completely.
Finely chop praline. Mix ice cream, cinnamon and half of praline in medium bowl (reserve remaining praline for another use). Cover ice cream and freeze.
FOR COOKIES: Position rack in center of oven; preheat to 350°F. Combine first 4 ingredients in medium bowl. Beat butter, shortening and 2/3 cup sugar in large bowl until smooth. Beat in egg. Mix in flour mixture, then crystallized ginger. Transfer dough to ungreased nonstick 13x9x1/2-inch baking sheet. Using rubber spatula, spread dough evenly over baking sheet, covering completely (dough will be sticky). Bake until top is dry and edges begin to brown, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven. Immediately cut into 5x2-inch rectangles. Cool. Freeze 8 cookies 1 hour (reserve remainder for another use).(Ice cream and cookies can be made 1 day ahead. Keep frozen.)
Soften praline ice cream until spreadable. Spread 1/2 cup ice cream over bottom of each of 4 cookies. Top each with another cookie, bottom side down, forming sandwiches. Wrap tightly in plastic; freeze until firm, at least 4 hours. (Can be made 3 days ahead. Keep frozen.)
Place frozen cookie sandwich on work surface. Lay paper strips diagonally across top of cookie. Sift powdered sugar over, forming diagonal lines. Remove strips. Repeat with remaining sandwiches. Place 1 sandwich on each of 4 plates. Using slotted spoon, surround each with compote. Drizzle any syrup from compote around fruit.

Place 1 veal scallop between sheets of waxed paper. Flatten to thickness of 1/8-inch using mallet or rolling pin. Repeat with remaining veal. Season veal with sage and pepper. Place 1 slice of prosciutto atop each veal scallop. Fold each veal scallop in half crosswise. Secure open ends with toothpick.
Dredge veal in flour; shake off excess. Melt 3 tablespoons butter in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add veal and cook until golden, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer veal to platter; tent with foil to keep warm. Pour off fat from skillet and discard.
Add wine to skillet and bring to boil, scraping up any browned bits. Boil until liquid is reduced to 1/4 cup, about 8 minutes. Reduce heat to low. Whisk in 6 tablespoons chilled butter 1 tablespoon at a time. Season sauce with salt and pepper. Remove toothpicks from veal. Pour sauce over. Garnish with lemon wedges and serve.

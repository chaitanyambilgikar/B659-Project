Bring 4 1/2 cups water, sliced leeks, and 3/4 teaspoon curry powder to boil in medium pot over medium-high heat. Boil 5 minutes. Add asparagus. Reduce heat to medium; cover and simmer until asparagus is tender, about 15 minutes. Cool slightly. Set aside 2 tablespoons crème fraîche; stir remaining crème fraîche, 4 tablespoons chopped dill, and 3/4 teaspoon curry powder into soup. Puree in batches in blender until smooth. Strain soup into large bowl. Season soup to taste with salt and pepper. Refrigerate until cold, about 4 hours, or up to 1 day.
Divide chilled asparagus bisque among 6 bowls. Top each with 1 teaspoon crème fraîche. Sprinkle with remaining chopped fresh dill and whole pink peppercorns, if desired.

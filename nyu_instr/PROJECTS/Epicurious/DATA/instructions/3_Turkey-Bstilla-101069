Make almond sugar: In a food processor finely grind together almonds, sugar, and cinnamon.
Make filling: Mince garlic. Chop cilantro and mint. Chop enough onion to measure 1 1/2 cups.
In a large saucepan bring broth to a boil and remove pan from heat. Stir in saffron and steep 10 minutes. Add turkey and simmer mixture, stirring and breaking up lumps, 2 minutes, or until meat is just cooked through. In a large sieve set over a bowl drain turkey mixture and return drained cooking liquid to pan. Transfer turkey mixture to a large bowl. Boil cooking liquid until reduced to about 3/4 cup, about 10 minutes. Transfer 1/4 cup liquid to a small bowl and reserve. Reduce heat to moderate and add whites in a stream to liquid remaining in pan, whisking. Cook mixture, whisking, until whites are opaque, about 2 minutes. Add egg mixture to turkey mixture and stir until combined. In a non-stick skillet heat oil over moderate heat until hot but not smoking and cook onion, stirring, until golden. Add ras el hanout, flour, gingerroot, and garlic and cook, stirring constantly, 1 minute. Add reserved cooking liquid and boil, stirring and scraping up brown bits, 1 minute. Add mixture to turkey with raisins, lemon juice, cilantro, and mint, stirring until combined well. Cool filling completely. Filling may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.
Preheat oven to 350°F.
Stack phyllo sheets on a work surface and cover stack with overlapping sheets of plastic wrap and then a dampened kitchen towel. Working quickly (phyllo dries out easily), arrange 1 phyllo sheet in a 9-inch glass pie plate, letting edges hang over. Sprinkle bottom with 2 teaspoons almond sugar and 1 tablespoon bread crumbs. Repeat layering 2 more times, arranging each phyllo sheet in a different position to create an even overhang all around. Top with remaining phyllo sheet and spoon filling evenly into shell. Sprinkle filling with 2 teaspoons almond sugar and carefully fold overhanging phyllo over top of filling to enclose it completely (phyllo will be very brittle; donâ€™t worry if it breaks). Sprinkle remaining almond sugar over top. Bake pie in lower third of oven 25 minutes (top will be golden brown in places).
Dust pie with confectioners' sugar and cinnamon and serve immediately.

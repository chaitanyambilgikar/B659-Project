Whisk together eggs and tarragon in a bowl and season with salt and pepper. Melt butter in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderate heat, then cook spinach, stirring occasionally, until just wilted.
Add egg mixture and cream cheese and cook, stirring slowly, until eggs are just set, about 3 minutes.

In a bowl whisk together the flour, the baking powder, the salt, the cayenne, and a pinch of black pepper, add the butter, and blend the mixture until it resembles coarse meal. Add the roasted peppers, the Parmesan, and the milk and stir the mixture until it just forms a dough. Drop the dough in 6 mounds about 2 inches apart onto a buttered baking sheet and bake the biscuits in the middle of a preheated 425°F. oven for 15 to 18 minutes, or until they are golden and cooked through.

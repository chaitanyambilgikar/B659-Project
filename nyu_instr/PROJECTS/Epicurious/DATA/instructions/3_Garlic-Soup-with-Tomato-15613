Heat the oven to 225°F (107°C; less than #1/2 gas mark; less than #1/4 British regulo). Lay the bread directly on the middle rack and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, just to dry it out.
In a food processor, pulse the tomatoes, half of the garlic, and the bell peppers until coarsely chopped.
In a medium saucepan, heat the oil over medium heat. Scrape the vegetables into the pan. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. Stir in the remaining garlic, the salt, and 2 cups (500 ml) water. Bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Season with pepper. The soup can be made ahead to this point and refrigerated for up to 2 days.
If it has been refrigerated, quickly bring the soup back to a boil. Lay 1 slice of dry bread in the bottom of each of four shallow soup bowls. Pour the soup over the bread. Let sit for 10 minutes. Serve.

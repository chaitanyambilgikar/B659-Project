Add onion and bell pepper; sauté until onion is soft, about 6 minutes. Add cumin and oregano; sauté 1 minute. Add beans with their liquid and chipotles. Simmer over medium-low heat until slightly thickened, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.

(Can be made 2 days ahead. Chill dip and bacon separately.)Stir half of bacon into dip. Top with sour cream. Sprinkle with cilantro and remaining bacon. Serve dip chilled or at room temperature.
*Chipotle chilies canned in a spicy tomato sauce, sometimes called adobo, are available at Latin American markets, specialty foods stores and some supermarkets.

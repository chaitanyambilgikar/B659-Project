Peel potatoes and cover with by 1 inch in a 2- to 3-quart saucepan, then boil, uncovered, until just tender. Drain in a colander. When potatoes are cool enough to handle, cut into 1/4-inch dice.
Just before serving, stir together potatoes and remaining ingredients except chutneys in a large bowl, then stir in 1/2 cup tamarind chutney and 2 tablespoons cilantro and mint chutney. Serve immediately with remainder of chutneys on the side.

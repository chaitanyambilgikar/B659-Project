In a large saucepan combine neck, giblets, broth, water, celery, carrot, and onion and bring to a boil, skimming froth. Add remaining ingredients and cook at a bare simmer 2 hours, or until liquid is reduced to 5 cups. Strain stock through a fine sieve into a bowl. Stock may be made 2 days ahead. Cool stock completely, uncovered, and keep chilled or frozen in an airtight container.

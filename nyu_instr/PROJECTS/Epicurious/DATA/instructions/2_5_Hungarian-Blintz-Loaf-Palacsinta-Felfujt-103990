1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (325°F if using a glass pan). Grease a 9-inch square baking pan.
2. To make the batter: In a blender, food processor, or large bowl, beat together all the batter ingredients until smooth.
3. To make the filling: Combine all the filling ingredients.
4. Pour half of the batter into the prepared pan, drop the filling by heaping tablespoonfuls over the batter, then carefully top with the remaining batter (the layers will mix a bit). The loaf can be covered and refrigerated for up to 24 hours. Return to room temperature before baking.
5. Bake until puffed and lightly browned, 50 to 60 minutes. Serve warm, accompanied with a fruit sauce or fresh fruit if desired.

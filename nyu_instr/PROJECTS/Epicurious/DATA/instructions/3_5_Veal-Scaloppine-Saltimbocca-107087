Cook spaghetti in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally. Drain. Transfer to large bowl and toss with 1 tablespoon oil. Keep warm.
Meanwhile, mix cornmeal, herbes de Provence, salt, and pepper in medium bowl. Coat veal in cornmeal mixture.
Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add veal, prosciutto, and sage. Sauté 2 minutes. Turn veal over and sauté until cooked through, about 2 minutes longer. Add Marsala and broth; boil until slightly reduced, about 1 minute. Transfer veal to plate. Add butter to skillet; whisk until melted. Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper. Return veal to skillet to coat with sauce.
Divide pasta between 2 plates. Top with veal and sauce, dividing equally.

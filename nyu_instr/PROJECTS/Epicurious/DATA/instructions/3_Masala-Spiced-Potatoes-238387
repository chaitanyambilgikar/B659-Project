Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 500°F.
Pat potatoes dry, then toss with remaining ingredients in a bowl until evenly coated.
Spread out potatoes in 1 layer in a large (17- by 12-inch) shallow heavy baking pan, then roast, turning potatoes over with a metal spatula once or twice during roasting, until tender and some edges are golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes.

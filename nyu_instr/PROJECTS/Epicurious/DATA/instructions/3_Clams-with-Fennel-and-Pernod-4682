Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add onions, fennel bulb with fronds, garlic and fennel seeds; sauté until fennel bulb is tender, about 10 minutes. Add wine; boil until liquid is reduced by half, about 4 minutes. Stir in tomatoes and Pernod; simmer 5 minutes to blend flavors. Add clams to pot; cover and cook until clams open, about 8 minutes (discard any that do not open). Transfer to large bowl. Sprinkle with oregano. Garnish with lemon.

Steam potatoes in a vegetable steamer set over 1 inch of boiling water in a wide 4- to 5-quart pot, covered, until tender when pierced with a paring knife, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board.
Meanwhile, cook asparagus in a wide 4- to 5-quart pot of boiling salted water, uncovered, until just tender, about 3 minutes. Transfer asparagus with tongs to a bowl of ice and cold water to stop cooking, then drain and pat dry. Cut off and reserve tips, then cut stalks into 1-inch pieces. Add tips and stalks to a large bowl.
Cook bacon in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until golden and crisp, about 8 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain, reserving bacon drippings in skillet.
Once potatoes have cooled to warm, cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Add to bowl with asparagus, along with bacon, ham, celery, onion, parsley, and pickle.
Return skillet with bacon drippings to moderately high heat. Add oil, then whisk in vinegar, sugar, mustard, salt, and pepper and cook, stirring and scraping up brown bits, 30 seconds. Immediately pour hot dressing over potato salad and toss to coat.

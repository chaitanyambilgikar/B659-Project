Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until tender, stirring occasionally. Drain, reserving 1/2 cup cooking liquid.
Meanwhile, melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium-low heat. Add sage leaves and cook until edges curl and butter is dark amber (do not burn), stirring and turning leaves occasionally, about 6 minutes. Transfer sage to paper towels. Add veal stock to brown butter.
Add pasta and 5 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese to brown butter mixture in skillet; toss to coat, adding reserved cooking liquid by tablespoonfuls if dry. Season with salt and pepper. Divide among bowls. Garnish with fried sage leaves, passing cheese alongside.

Peel outer strings from celery ribs with a sharp paring knife, then cut ribs on a 45-degree angle into paper-thin slices with slicer.
Stir together 1 quart water and 1 tablespoon salt in a bowl until salt is dissolved. Add celery and soak 15 minutes, then drain in a colander. Spread celery evenly on a clean kitchen towel. Gently roll up towel and let stand 5 minutes.
Wipe mushrooms with paper towels to remove any dirt or grit. Keeping stems attached, trim any discoloration from stems with paring knife.
Cut mushrooms into paper-thin slices with slicer and transfer to a large bowl. Add celery, lemon juice, oil, pepper, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and gently toss with your hands.
Divide salad among 6 plates. Just before serving, use a vegetable peeler to shave cheese to taste over each salad.

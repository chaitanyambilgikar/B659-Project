Place steak in heavy large resealable plastic bag. Puree remaining ingredients in blender or processor. Season marinade with salt and pepper. Pour marinade into bag with steak; seal bag. Let steak marinate at room temperature 2 hours or chill up to 6 hours, turning bag occasionally.
Preheat broiler or prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Broil or grill steak until cooked to desired doneness, about 7 minutes per side for medium-rare. Transfer steak to platter; let stand 15 minutes. Thinly slice steak crosswise.

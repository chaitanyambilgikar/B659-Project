Mix soy sauce with cornstarch in small bowl. Heat sesame and peanut oils in wok or heavy skillet over high heat. Add vegetables, garlic and ginger and stir-fry until vegetables are crisp-tender, about 4 minutes. Add scallops and stir-fry until almost cooked through, about 1 minute. Stir soy sauce mixture and add to wok. Stir until liquid boils and thickens and scallops are opaque, about 2 minutes. Transfer to platter and serve immediately.

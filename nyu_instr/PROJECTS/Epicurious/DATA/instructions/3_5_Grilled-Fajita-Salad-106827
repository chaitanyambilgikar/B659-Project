Prepare barbecue (high heat). Place pork in shallow dish. Sprinkle pork on both sides with chili powder and salt. Pour 2/3 cup vinaigrette over pork. Let marinate 10 minutes. Place peppers and onion slices on rimmed baking sheet. Brush with 1/3 cup vinaigrette.
Grill vegetables until tender, turning often, about 8 minutes total. Remove pork from vinaigrette. Grill until cooked through, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to cutting board. Thinly slice meat across grain. Separate onion slices into rings and cut peppers into strips.
Toss lettuce in large bowl with remaining 1/3 cup vinaigrette. Divide among 4 plates. Top with pork and vegetables. Sprinkle with tortilla chips.

Make dough: Blend all-purpose flour and eggs in a food processor until mixture just begins to form a ball. (Dough should come together but still be somewhat sticky.) If dough is too loose, add additional flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, until dough comes together. Transfer to a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let stand at room temperature 20 minutes.
Roll out dough: Set smooth rollers of pasta machine at widest setting. Cut dough into 3 pieces and keep 2 pieces and keep 2 pieces wrapped in plastic wrap. Flatten unwrapped piece of dough into a rectangle and dust with all-purpose flour, then feed through rollers. Fold rectangle in half and feed through rollers 4 more times, folding in half each time and dusting with flour as necessary to prevent sticking.
Turn dial to next (narrower) setting and feed dough through without folding. Continue to feed dough through without folding, making space between rollers narrower each time, until second-to-last setting is used. Cut sheet into 4 (6- by 4-inch) rectangles.
Transfer to a wax-paper-lined baking sheet dusted with semolina flour and cover with plastic wrap. Roll out and cut remaining dough into noodles for another use.

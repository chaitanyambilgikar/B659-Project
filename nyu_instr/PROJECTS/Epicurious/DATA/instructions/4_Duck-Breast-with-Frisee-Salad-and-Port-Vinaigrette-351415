Put a small shallow flameproof roasting pan in middle of oven and preheat oven to 400°F.
Pat duck dry and trim off any fat from sides. Score duck skin in a crosshatch pattern at 1/2-inch intervals with a sharp knife, then season with 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper.
Heat a heavy medium skillet (not nonstick) over medium-high heat until hot, then cook duck, skin side down, until golden brown and crisp, about 3 minutes. Turn and cook until other side is golden, about 2 minutes. Transfer to roasting pan and roast in oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted horizontally into center registers 135°F, 10 to 14 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and let stand, loosely covered with foil, 5 minutes. (Internal temperature will rise to at least 142°F.)
Pour off all but 1 tablespoon fat from roasting pan, then add oil and shallot and cook over medium heat, stirring, until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and add Port, then return to heat (Port may ignite) and cook, stirring and scraping up brown bits, 1 minute.
Remove from heat and stir in mustard and salt and pepper to taste. Add frisée, tossing to combine, and sprinkle with almonds. Serve duck with salad.

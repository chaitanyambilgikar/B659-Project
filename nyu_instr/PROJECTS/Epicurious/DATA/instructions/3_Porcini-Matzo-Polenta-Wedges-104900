Cook onion in 1 tablespoon oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Add porcini and cook, stirring, 2 minutes. Cool, then stir in basil and season with salt and pepper.
Bring broth and water to a boil in a 3-quart heavy saucepan. Gradually add matzo meal, whisking, and simmer, whisking constantly, until thickened, 1 to 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low and gently simmer, stirring occasionally, until very thick, about 2 minutes more. Stir in porcini and salt and pepper to taste. Spread polenta in an oiled 9-inch glass pie plate and let stand until firm, about 1 hour.
Cut polenta into 12 wedges. Heat remaining tablespoon oil in skillet over moderate heat until hot but not smoking, then cook wedges until crisp and golden brown on both sides, about 15 minutes total.

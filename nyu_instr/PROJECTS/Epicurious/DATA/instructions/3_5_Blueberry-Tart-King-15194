Make crust On a lightly floured surface with a floured rolling pin roll out 1 sheet of puff pastry into a 12 1/2-inch square and fit it into a 10- by 1-inch round tart pan with a removable fluted rim. Roll rolling pin over top of rim to trim excess pastry and with a fork lightly prick bottom and sides all over.
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Using bottom of tart pan as a guide, trace a 10-inch circle on parchment and turn paper over. In a small bowl whisk together egg and water for an egg wash.
On lightly floured surface with floured rolling pin roll out remaining sheet of puff pastry into a 12-inch square and with fork prick it all over. With a 2 1/2-inch star-shaped cutter cut out about 20 stars and lightly brush with egg wash. Arrange stars, slightly overlapping, to fill in circle on parchment paper, leaving spaces so that parchment shows through. (This will be top crust.) Lightly brush star crust again with egg wash and sprinkle with sugar. Chill shell and star crust until firm, about 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 425°F. while pastry is chilling.
Line shell with foil and fill with pie weights or raw rice. Bake shell in lower third and stars in upper third of oven 10 minutes, or until star crust is golden. Remove shell and stars from oven. Cool star crust on baking sheet on a rack. Carefully remove foil and weights or rice and bake shell until golden, 8 to 10 minutes more. (Do not worry if bottom of shell puffs up; the filling will weigh it down later.) Cool shell in pan on rack.
Make filling In a 3-quart saucepan combine filling ingredients and bring to a boil, stirring until berries have burst and mixture is liquid. Cook mixture over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, 10 minutes, or until tapioca is dissolved and filling is slightly thickened. Remove pan from heat and cool filling.
Remove rim from tart pan and transfer shell to a plate. Spread filling evenly in tart shell. Carefully slide star crust onto filling.

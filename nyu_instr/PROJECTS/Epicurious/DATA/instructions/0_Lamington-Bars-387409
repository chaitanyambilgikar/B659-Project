Preheat the oven to 325°F. Line a half-sheet pan with parchment paper.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the eggs and sugar on high speed until light and foamy, about 5 minutes.
In another bowl, sift the flour and baking powder together.
Melt the butter in a small saucepan, and add the corn syrup.
Remove the egg mixture from the mixer. With a silicone spatula, fold in the flour mixture. Add the milk, and then the butter mixture, just until combined. Spread the batter onto the prepared pan. Bake for 8 minutes. Cool completely on a wire rack
Chocolate Ganache Place the chocolate in a heatproof bowl. Heat the cream over a medium heat, just until boiling. Pour the hot cream over the chocolate, stirring until melted and smooth.
Finish Line a half-sheet pan with parchment paper. Cut the sponge in half, down the middle. Spread the raspberry jam evenly over one half and place the other half on top. Cut into even cubes.
Using a fork, dip each cube into the chocolate ganache, and then roll each one in a bowl of the coconut, coating the entire cube. Place the coated cube on the parchment-lined half-sheet pan. Repeat this process and chill the pan full of cubes, uncovered, in the refrigerator for a few minutes to set.

1. Preheat oven to 375°F.
2. Grease two 6-cup muffin tins with butter.
3. In a large bowl, combine all the ingredients but the dough and 1 tablespoon of the eggs; refrigerate.
4. Unroll the dough and cut out twelve 4-inch circles with a biscuit cutter or the rim of a drinking glass.
5. Reroll the scraps, then cut out 12 more 2-inch circles.
6. Line the bottoms and sides of the tins with the 4-inch rounds.
7. Divide the filling evenly among the cups. Press the 2-inch rounds on top, pinching the edges together to seal.
8. Poke a hole in the center of each pie.
9. Brush with the reserved egg and bake until the tops are browned and puffed slightly, 30 to 35 minutes.
10. Let cool for 15 minutes before removing the pies. Serve warm.

Puree raspberries and sugar in blender. Strain into small bowl. Mix in brandy. (Can be prepared up to 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.) Set aside.
Preheat oven to 400°F. Beat egg whites and salt in medium bowl to soft peaks. Gradually add sugar, beating until stiff peaks form. Arrange bananas on baking sheet. Spoon meringue into pastry bag fitted with medium (no. 6) star tip. Pipe meringue over bananas in decorative pattern, covering most of banana surface.
Bake bananas until meringue is deep golden brown, about 15 minutes. Transfer bananas to plates. Spoon raspberry sauce around and serve.

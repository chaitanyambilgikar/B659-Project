Stir sugar, half and half, chocolate, corn syrup, butter and salt in heavy medium saucepan over low heat until sugar dissolves and chocolate melts. Increase heat to medium-low and cook until sauce is smooth and thick, stirring constantly, about 4 minutes. Remove sauce from heat. Stir in framboise. (Can be made 1 week ahead. Cover and chill. Rewarm over low heat, stirring frequently, before serving.)
For each serving, spoon 1 tablespoon sauce into sundae glass or wine goblet. Top with 2 scoops of ice cream. Spoon 3 tablespoons sauce over. Sprinkle raspberries over and serve immediately.

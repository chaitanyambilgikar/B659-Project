1. In a medium-size bowl, beat the eggs with the cumin and salt and pepper. In a large nonstick skillet, melt the clarified butter over medium heat, then cook the chiles, scallions, and ginger until soft, about 3 minutes, stirring. Add the tomato, coriander, and turmeric and cook for 2 minutes, stirring.
2. Add the eggs and cook on medium heat until congealed but not dry, about 3 minutes, lifting them gently and turning them with a rubber spatula. Once they have congealed, transfer them to a serving platter and garnish with the tomato wedges and coriander leaves. Serve immediately.

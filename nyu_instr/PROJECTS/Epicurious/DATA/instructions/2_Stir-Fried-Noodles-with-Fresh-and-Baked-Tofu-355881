1. Mix the sauce ingredients together and set aside.
2. Bring a pot of water to boil for the noodles and tofu. Reduce it to a simmer, add the cubed tofu and simmer gently for 4 minutes. Lift out the tofu with a strainer and set aside. Return the water to a boil, add the noodles and cook until tender-firm, following the package directions. Drain and rinse under cold water. Toss with 1 tablespoon of the oil and set aside.
3. Set a wok or skillet over high heat. Add the remaining oil, swirl it around. When hot, add the ginger, garlic, chile, and baked tofu. Stir-fry around. When hot, add the ginger, garlic, chile, and baked tofu. Stir-fry for 1 minute, then add onion, mushrooms, broccoli, bell pepper, and carrots. Season with a few pinches of salt and stir-fry, rapidly tossing the vegetables in their pan, for 3 minutes.
4. Now add the snow peas, scallions, and boiled tofu. Stir-fry for 1 minute more, then add the noodles and the sauce. Reduce the heat, toss so that everything is evenly mingled, then cover and cook until the noodles are heated through, a matter of just a few minutes. Turn onto a large platter and garnish with sprigs of cilantro.

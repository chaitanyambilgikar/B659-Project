For Sauce: Combine sorrel, wine and shallots in heavy small saucepan. Stir over medium heat until sorrel wilts, about 2 minutes. Add cream and lime juice. Boil until reduced to sauce consistency, about 12 minutes. Transfer sauce to blender. Purée until almost smooth. Return sauce to same saucepan. Season with ground white pepper and salt.
For Fish: Finely grind pecans, tarragon and basil in processor. Blend in butter. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to small bowl. (Sauce and nut mixture can be made 1 day ahead. Cover separately and chill. Let nut mixture stand at room temperature 30 minutes before using.)
Preheat oven to 350°F. Oil large baking sheet. Arrange salmon on prepared sheet. Sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper. Spoon equal amount of nut mixture over top of each fillet.
Bake salmon until cooked through, about 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, bring sauce to simmer.
Using spatula, transfer salmon to plates. Spoon sauce around fish.

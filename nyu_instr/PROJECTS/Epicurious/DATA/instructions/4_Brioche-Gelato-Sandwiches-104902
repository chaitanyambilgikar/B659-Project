Stir together yeast, sugar, and warm water in a warmed small bowl until sugar is dissolved, then let stand until foamy, about 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, whisk together whole egg, yolks, and honey in a bowl.
Mix together 2 1/2 cups flour and sea salt in warmed bowl of electric mixer fitted with paddle attachment. Add dissolved yeast, beating until combined well, then add butter 1 piece at a time, beating well after each addition.
Beat in eggs with honey, then continue to beat dough until it forms a ball, adding more flour 1 teaspoon at a time if dough is too sticky. Change mixer attachment to dough hook and knead dough until smooth and elastic but still soft, 8 to 10 minutes. Form dough into a ball.
Sprinkle a warmed large bowl with some flour and add dough. Cover bowl with a kitchen towel and let dough rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
Punch down dough and knead several times to release air. Divide dough into 12 pieces, then form each into a 1 1/2-inch ball and flatten slightly. Arrange about 2 inches apart in a buttered large shallow (1-inch-deep) baking pan. Cover with a kitchen towel and let rise in a warm place until about 2 1/2 inches in diameter, about 1 1/2 hours.
Preheat oven to 450°F.
Brush rolls lightly with egg white and bake in middle of oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Cool in pan on a rack 5 minutes.
Split rolls horizontally and fill with gelato.

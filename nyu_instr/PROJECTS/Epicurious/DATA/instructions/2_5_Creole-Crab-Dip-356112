With motor running, drop garlic into a food processor and chop.
Stop motor and add roasted red peppers, vinegar, cayenne to taste, and 1/2 teaspoon salt to food processor and purée until smooth. Add mayonnaise and process until combined.
Transfer roasted red pepper mixture to a heavy medium pot and heat over low heat. Gently stir in crabmeat and cook until just heated through, then stir in chives.

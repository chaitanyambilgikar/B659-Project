1. Combine oil, ketchup, onion, bell pepper, hot sauce, salt, lemon juice, red pepper, paprika, and parsley. Cover and refrigerate for two days. Remove from refrigerator and allow to come to room temperature.
2. Transfer marinade to a large skillet. Add shrimp and stir to combine. Sauté over medium heat until shrimp are opaque, about 5 minutes. Add potatoes and cook until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Taste and adjust for seasoning. Serve immediately.

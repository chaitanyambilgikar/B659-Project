Cook carrots in large pot of boiling salted water 2 minutes. Add cucumbers and cook until all vegetables are crisp-tender, about 1 minute longer. Drain well. Pat scallops dry with paper towels. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Melt 2 tablespoons butter with oil in heavy large skillet over high heat. Working in batches, add scallops; sauté until golden and just cooked through, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to platter.
Add cream, ginger and curry powder to same skillet. Add any accumulated juices from scallops on platter. Reduce heat to medium. Simmer until slightly thickened, about 3 minutes. Add remaining 2 tablespoons butter; whisk until melted. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Return scallops to skillet. Add carrots and cucumbers; toss to combine. Cook just until scallops and vegetables are heated through, about 1 minute.

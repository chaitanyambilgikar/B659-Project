Whisk eggs in large bowl until well blended. Add tomato, goat cheese, green onions, chopped mint, salt and pepper; whisk to blend. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add shallots; sauté 3 minutes. Add remaining 2 tablespoons butter to skillet and let melt. Add egg mixture; cook 2 minutes without stirring. Using spatula or large spoon, gently stir and turn over portions of the egg mixture until cooked through but soft, about 4 minutes.
Divide scrambled eggs among 4 plates. Garnish with mint sprigs, if desired, and serve.

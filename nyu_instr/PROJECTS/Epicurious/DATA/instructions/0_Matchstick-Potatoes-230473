Peel potatoes and cut lengthwise into 1/8-inch-thick julienne in processor or with mandoline. Transfer as cut to a bowl of ice and cold water and let chill in water at least 30 minutes.
Heat 1 1/4 inches oil in a 6- to 7-quart heavy pot over moderately high heat until thermometer registers 375°F.
While oil heats, drain potatoes and pat completely dry between several layers of paper towels. Fry potatoes in 6 batches, gently stirring once or twice with a slotted spoon or skimmer, until golden and crisp, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes per batch. Transfer potatoes with slotted spoon to paper towels to drain and season with salt. (Return oil to 375°F between batches.)

Stir together rice, cottage cheese, eggs, flour, sugar, salt, cinnamon, and 3 tablespoons butter in a bowl. Let stand 5 minutes.
Lightly coat a 12-inch nonstick skillet with some of remaining butter and heat over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking. Working in batches of 3 or 4, pour a scant 1/4 cup batter per pancake into skillet and sauté, turning over once, until pancakes are golden brown but still slightly soft, 4 to 5 minutes per batch, adding more butter as needed.

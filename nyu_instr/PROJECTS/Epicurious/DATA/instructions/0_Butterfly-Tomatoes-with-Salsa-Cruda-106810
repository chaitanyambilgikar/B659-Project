1. Core the tomatoes and cut them into 1/2-inch pieces. Place in a large serving bowl with the garlic. (If the tomatoes seem watery, drain them first in a colander for 20 minutes, tapping it once or twice.)
2. Stir in olive oil, 1/4 cup of the mint, the lemon zest, sugar, and pepper. Let rest for 2 to 4 hours for flavors to blend.
3. Before serving, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta until just tender; drain. Add to the tomato sauce; toss well. Before serving, season lightly with salt. If desired, grate ricotta salata atop the pasta using the largest holes of the grater. Sprinkle with the remaining chopped mint. Serve.

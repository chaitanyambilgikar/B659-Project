Cook onion in 2 tablespoons oil in a 2-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until softened and golden, about 6 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add wine and boil 1 minute. Add artichoke hearts, tomatoes (including juice), olives, water, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and bring to a simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally.
Meanwhile, pat fish dry and sprinkle with remaining 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.
Transfer sauce to a 13- by 9- by 2-inch (3-quart) glass or ceramic baking dish and arrange fish (without crowding) over sauce. Dot fish with butter and cover dish tightly with foil. Roast until fish is just opaque and cooked through, 12 to 14 minutes.
Meanwhile, stir together zest and remaining 2 tablespoons oil.
Transfer fish with vegetables and broth to shallow bowls and serve drizzled with orange oil.

Line a bamboo or metal steamer basket or cake rack with 2 cabbage leaves. Place the dumplings on the leaves in a single layer, 1/2 inch apart. The size of your steamer rack will determine how many dumplings can be cooked at one time.
Bring water to a boil in a covered steamer over high heat. Carefully place the steamer basket or rack (if using a rack, the water level cannot touch the cabbage leaves) into steamer, cover, and steam 5 to 7 minutes on high heat until the pork is just cooked through. Carefully remove dumplings from the steamer and continue steaming remaining dumplings using fresh cabbage leaves and replenishing steamer with more boiling water, if necessary. Serve immediately.

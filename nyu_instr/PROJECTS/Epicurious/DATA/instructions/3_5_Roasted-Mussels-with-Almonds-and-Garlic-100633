Preheat oven to 425°F.
Scrub mussels well and remove beards. Finely chop almonds and on a baking sheet toast in middle of oven until golden, about 4 minutes.
Mince garlic and chop parsley. In an ovenproof kettle at least 10 inches wide combine mussels, garlic, parsley, wine, and butter and season with pepper. Roast mussels, uncovered, in middle of oven, stirring once halfway through roasting, 15 minutes, or until mussels have opened. Discard any unopened mussels. Add almonds, tossing to combine.

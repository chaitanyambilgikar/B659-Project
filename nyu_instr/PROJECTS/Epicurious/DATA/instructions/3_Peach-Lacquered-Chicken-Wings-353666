With motor running, drop garlic into a food processor and finely chop. Add ginger and finely chop.
Add preserves, soy sauce, water, and red-pepper flakes and pulse until sauce is combined.

Pat wings dry and put in sheet pan. Season with 3/4 teaspoon salt. Pour sauce over wings and toss to coat, then spread in 1 layer.

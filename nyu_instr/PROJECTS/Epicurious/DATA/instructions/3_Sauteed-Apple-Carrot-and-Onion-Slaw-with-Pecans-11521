In a 10- to 12-inch non-stick skillet sauté pecans in butter over moderately high heat, stirring, until golden and transfer with a slotted spoon to a small dish. Using the julienne blade of a hand-held slicing device or food processor cut apple, cored, and carrot into 1/8-inch julienne strips and add with onion to skillet. In the skillet sauté mixture over moderately high heat, stirring, 1 minute and stir in water, sugar, salt, and pepper to taste. Simmer slaw, covered, until carrot is just tender, 1 to 2 minutes.

In a large skillet, melt the Crisco over low heat. Add garlic powder and Velveeta and Colby cheeses. Stir continuously over very low heat so the mixture doesn't burn. When cheese has melted, add green chilies and salsa, stirring to combine. Add evaporated milk and stir over low heat: DO NOT LET THE MIXTURE BOIL. Serve warm with tortilla chips or as a sauce on tacos or hamburgers.

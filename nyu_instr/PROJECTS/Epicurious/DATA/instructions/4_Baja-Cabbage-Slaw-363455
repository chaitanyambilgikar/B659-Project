Remove the outer leaves of the cabbage. Cut a V-shaped wedge around the tough inner core and remove the core and discard. Halve the cabbage to make 2 quarter sections. With a large, sharp knife, slice each section crosswise into a thin julienne (about 1/8 inch thick) or julienne with a hand-held Japanese mandoline. Transfer the julienned cabbage to a large bowl. In a bowl, mix together the mayonnaise, lime juice, and Tabasco. Toss the mayonnaise mixture with the cabbage, refrigerate, and use within a few hours.

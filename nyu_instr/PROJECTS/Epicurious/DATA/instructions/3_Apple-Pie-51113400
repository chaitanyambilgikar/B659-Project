1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Roll out the pie dough and use one round to line a 9-inch pie pan. Keep the dough-lined pan and the other round chilled while you prepare the filling.
2. In a large bowl, combine the apples, lemon juice, brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger; toss to combine. Mound the apples in the dough-lined pan, making the center higher than the sides. Dot the top evenly with the pieces of butter. Brush the rim of the pie shell with egg wash. Cut vents in the other dough round and place the round over the filling. Press the top and bottom edges together to seal, trim the excess dough so that the edges of the dough are almost even with the edges of the pan, and then crimp or flute the edges. Brush the top lightly with egg wash.
3. Place the pie on a baking sheet and bake until the top crust is golden brown and the apples feel tender when pierced through the steam vents with a knife, about 1 hour. Remove the pie from the oven and cool on a wire rack. Let the pie rest for 20 minutes before slicing. Serve warm or at room temperature.

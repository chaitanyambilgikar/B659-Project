Butter large baking sheet. In microwave-proof bowl, combine peanuts, sugar, corn syrup and salt. Microwave on High until mixture bubbles vigorously, about 6 minutes. Remove mixture from microwave and stir in butter and vanilla. Return to microwave and cook on High until candy turns light gold color, about 3 minutes. Remove bowl from microwave. Working quickly, add baking soda to candy mixture and stir briskly (mixture will foam up). Immediately pour out onto prepared baking sheet. Shake baking sheet from side to side to spread brittle as thinly as possible. Let stand until cold and hard, about 2 hours. Break brittle into pieces. Store in airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 month.

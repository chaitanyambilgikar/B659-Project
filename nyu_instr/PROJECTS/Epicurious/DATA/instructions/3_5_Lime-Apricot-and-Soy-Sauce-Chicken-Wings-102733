Preheat oven to 425°F. Cut off wing tips, reserving for another use, and halve wings at joint. Divide wings between 2 large roasting pans, arranging in single layers.
Purée remaining ingredients in a blender and pour mixture over wings, dividing evenly between pans. Bake wings in upper and lower thirds of oven 50 minutes. Turn wings over and switch position of pans in oven, then bake 45 minutes to 1 hour more, or until liquid is thick and sticky.
Serve wings warm or at room temperature.

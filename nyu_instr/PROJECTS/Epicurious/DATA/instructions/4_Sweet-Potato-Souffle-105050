Place the potatoes in a pot and add enough salted water to cover. Cook until tender. Drain. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Mash and whip the potatoes. Add the remaining ingredients (except marshmallows) and mix well. Pour into a greased casserole dish. Bake for 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and cover with marshmallows. Return to the oven and continue cooking until brown.

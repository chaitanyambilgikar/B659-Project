Purée zucchini, basil, shallot, garlic, water, salt, pepper, and oil (in batches if necessary) in a blender until smooth, 1 to 2 minutes per batch.
Transfer zucchini purée to a wide 6- to 7-quart heavy pot and add mussels. Bring to a simmer, uncovered, over moderately high heat, then cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until mussels just open wide (check frequently after 5 minutes and discard any mussels that remain unopened after 8 minutes).

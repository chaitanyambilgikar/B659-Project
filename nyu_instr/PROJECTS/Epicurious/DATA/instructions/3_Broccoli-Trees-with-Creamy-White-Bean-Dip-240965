Blanch broccoli in a pot of boiling salted water (1 tablespoon salt for 6 quarts water), uncovered, 2 minutes, then drain in a colander. Immediately plunge colander with broccoli into an ice bath to stop cooking, then drain again. Spread broccoli out on a kitchen towel to dry. (Broccoli will still be crisp.)
With motor of a food processor running, drop garlic through feed tube and process until finely chopped. Add remaining ingredients (except broccoli) and 1/2 teaspoon salt and purée until smooth. Force dip through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, discarding solids. Serve broccoli with dip.

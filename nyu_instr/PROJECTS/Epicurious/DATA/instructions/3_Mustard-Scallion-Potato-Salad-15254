In a saucepan cover potatoes with salted cold water by 1 inch and simmer, covered, until just tender, about 15 minutes. Drain potatoes well in a colander and, when just cool enough to handle, halve. Transfer hot potatoes to a bowl and immediately toss with vinegar. Add remaining ingredients and salt and pepper to taste and gently toss until combined well. Serve potato salad warm or at room temperature.

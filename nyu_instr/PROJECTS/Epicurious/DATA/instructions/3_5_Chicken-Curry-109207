Purée garlic, ginger, and 3 tablespoons water in a blender. Transfer to a large bowl and whisk in yogurt, 1/2 teaspoon salt, turmeric, and chili powder until combined. Add chicken and turn to coat well, then marinate, covered, at room temperature 30 minutes.
While chicken is marinating, finely grind cardamom pods, cloves, and cinnamon in grinder.
Heat oil in a 12- to 14-inch heavy skillet (2 to 3 inches deep) over moderate heat until hot but not smoking, then cook onion with bay leaves, stirring occasionally, until deep golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Add chicken with marinade and ground spices and cook, turning chicken and stirring occasionally, until almost all of marinade is evaporated, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in remaining 1 cup water and 3/4 teaspoon salt and simmer, covered, until chicken is cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer chicken with tongs to a platter and boil sauce, stirring occasionally, until reduced to about 1 cup, 8 to 10 minutes. Discard bay leaves and pour sauce over chicken.

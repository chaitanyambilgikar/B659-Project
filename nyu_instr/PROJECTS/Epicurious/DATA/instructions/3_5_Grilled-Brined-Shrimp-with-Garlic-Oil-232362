Stir 1 cup ice water and 1/3 cup salt in small saucepan over high heat until salt dissolves, about 5 minutes. Transfer salt water to large bowl. Mix in wine, 2 bay leaves, chopped lemon, peppercorns, and remaining 7 cups water, then shrimp. Chill at least 15 minutes and up to 1/2 hour.
Meanwhile, prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Whisk oil and garlic in small bowl to blend.
Drain shrimp, rinse, and drain well. Using kitchen scissors, cut shells down center of back side and devein, leaving shells intact. Grill shrimp in shells until charred and just opaque, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Grill bread until beginning to brown, about 2 minutes per side.
Transfer shrimp to another large bowl. Add half of garlic oil and toss to coat. Mound shrimp on platter. Garnish with remaining 4 bay leaves and lemon wedges. Serve with grilled bread and remaining garlic oil.

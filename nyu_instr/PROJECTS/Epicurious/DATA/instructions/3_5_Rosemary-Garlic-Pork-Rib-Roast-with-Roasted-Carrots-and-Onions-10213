Preheat oven to 350°F.
In a large roasting pan combine carrots and onions and sprinkle with bacon.
Trim fat on pork roast to 1/4 inch thick. With a paring knife make shallow slits in fat about 1 inch apart and in each insert a garlic slice and a rosemary leaf cluster. Season roast with salt and freshly ground black pepper and arrange, fat side up, on vegetables. Roast pork and vegetables 1 hour and 20 minutes, or until pork registers 160°F. on a meat thermometer. Transfer pork to a platter and let stand 15 minutes.
Pour off fat from pan. To pan with vegetables add water and cook over high heat, stirring to loosen brown bits, until most liquid is evaporated. Toss vegetables with parsley.
Arrange vegetables on platter with pork and garnish with rosemary and parsley sprigs.

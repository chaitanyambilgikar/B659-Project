Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).
Sprinkle drumsticks with salt and generous amount of pepper. Grill drumsticks 12 minutes, turning occasionally.
Meanwhile, stir chili powder and cumin in heavy small saucepan over medium heat until toasted and fragrant, about 1 minute. Mix in chili sauce, molasses, cider vinegar, orange juice, orange peel. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until sauce thickens slightly, about 6 minutes.
Reserve half of sauce in small bowl. Brush remaining sauce on chicken; continue to grill until cooked through, crisp and brown, turning occasionally, about 15 minutes longer. Serve chicken with reserved sauce.

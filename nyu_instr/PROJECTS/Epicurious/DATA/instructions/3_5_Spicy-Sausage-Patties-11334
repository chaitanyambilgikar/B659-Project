In a bowl combine well the pork butt, the pork fat, the garlic paste, the pepper, the sage, the thyme leaves, and the cayenne and chill the mixture, covered, overnight. Divide the mixture into 16 balls and flatten each ball into a 1/3-inch-thick patty. In a large skillet heat the oil over moderate heat until it is hot but not smoking, in it fry the patties in batches for 4 minutes on each side, or until they are golden brown and no longer pink within, and drain them on paper towels. Transfer the patties to a serving plate and garnish them with the thyme sprigs.

Place flour, sugar, and cumin seeds in large bowl. Add butter. Using handheld mixer, beat until coarse crumbs form. Beat in buttermilk and all but 1 tablespoon egg mixture. Add 2/3 of cheddar cheese and beat just until incorporated. Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface. Using floured hands, divide dough into 2 pieces. Pat each piece into 7-inch-diameter round. Brush rounds with reserved 1 tablespoon egg mixture. Sprinkle with remaining cheese, dividing equally. Cut each round into 6 wedges. Transfer to large baking sheet, spacing 1/2 inch apart. (Scones can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
Preheat oven to 400°F. Bake scones until golden brown on top, about 25 minutes. Let scones cool on baking sheet 10 minutes. Serve warm.

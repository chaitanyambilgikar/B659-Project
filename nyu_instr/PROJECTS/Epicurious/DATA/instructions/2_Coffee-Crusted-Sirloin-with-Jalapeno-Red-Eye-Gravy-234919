Combine 1/2 cup ground coffee, garlic powder, pepper and salt in a flat-bottom soup bowl or pie plate. Dredge the steaks in the mixture, coating both sides. Heat the canola oil in a cast-iron skillet with an ovenproof handle over high heat. Spray the steaks with nonstick cooking spray. Sear the steaks in the skillet, turning to sear both sides. Transfer the skillet to a 450°F oven to finish cooking the steaks to the desired doneness. Remove the skillet from the oven; transfer the steaks to a plate and keep warm. Combine 1 cup brewed coffee and the stock in the hot skillet, stirring with a wooden spoon to incorporate all the brown bits. Cook over medium-high heat until the liquid is reduced to 1 cup. Add the jelly, brown sugar, lemon juice, cornstarch mixture and any accumulated juices from the steaks; mix well. Serve the gravy over the steaks.

Preheat oven to 350°F. Grease and flour an 8-inch square baking pan, knocking out excess flour.
In a metal bowl or top of a double boiler set over barely simmering water melt chocolate and butter, stirring until smooth, and remove from heat. Whisk in sugar and jam until smooth. Add egg and whisk until smooth. Add flour and salt and whisk until smooth.
Spread batter evenly in pan and bake in middle of oven 12 to 15 minutes, or until just set and a tester comes out with crumbs adhering. Cool brownies in pan on a rack 5 minutes and cut into 9 squares.
Arrange 2 or 3 warm brownies on each of 2 dessert plates, reserving remaining brownies for later consumption. Top brownies with scoops of ice cream and drizzle with brandy.

Soak bread in 1/2 cup water 1 minute, then squeeze dry, discarding soaking water.
Mash garlic to a paste with salt using a mortar and pestle (or mince and mash with a large knife). Blend garlic paste and almonds in a food processor until nuts are as smooth as possible. Add bread and 1 tablespoon vinegar and, with motor running, add oil in a slow stream, then add ice water and blend well. Force purée through a fine sieve into a bowl, pressing firmly on solids. Discard solids.
Transfer soup to a glass container and chill, covered, until cold, about 3 hours. Season with salt and vinegar before serving.

Preheat oven to 325°F.
Have ready a bowl of cold water. Peel potatoes and witha 3/4-inch melon-ball cutter cut out potato balls, dropping into water as cut. Drain potatoes in a colander and transfer them to several layers of paper towels, patting very dry.
In a 12-inch ovenproof heavy skillet (preferably cast-iron) heat goose fat over moderate heat until hot but not smoking. Add potatoes, stirring to coat with fat, and roast in middle of oven, turning potatoes every 15 minutes, until crisp and golden, about 45 minutes.
While potatoes are roasting, in a very small saucepan cook garlic in butter over low heat, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 3 minutes.
With a slotted spoon transfer potatoes to a large bowl and stir in garlic butter, parsley, and salt to taste.

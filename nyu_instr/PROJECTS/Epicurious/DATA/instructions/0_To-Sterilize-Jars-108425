Wash jars, lids, and screw bands in hot soapy water, then rinse well. Dry screw bands.
Put jars and lids on a rack in a boiling-water canner or a deep 8- to 10-quart pot and add enough water to cover by 2 inches. Heat water until an instant-read or candy thermometer registers 180°F (do not let boil). Keep jars submerged in hot water, covered, until ready to use.

Make cakes: Preheat oven to 375°F and generously butter muffin cups.
Melt chocolate and butter in a metal bowl set over a pan of barely simmering water, stirring until smooth. Remove bowl from heat and add brown sugar and vanilla, whisking until smooth. Add flour and salt, whisking until just combined, then add eggs 1 at a time, whisking after each addition.
Divide batter among muffin cups and bake in middle of oven until a tester comes out with crumbs adhering, 12 to 15 minutes. Invert cakes onto a rack and cool 5 minutes.
Make espresso cream while cakes cool: Beat cream with espresso powder and sugar in a bowl with an electric mixer until it just holds stiff peaks.
Serve 6 cakes topped with cream.

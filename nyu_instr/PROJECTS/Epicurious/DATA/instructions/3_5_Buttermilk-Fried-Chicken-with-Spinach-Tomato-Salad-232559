Add enough canola oil to 12-inch skillet to reach depth of 1/2 inch. Heat over medium-high heat to 375°F. Remove 6 chicken pieces from buttermilk mixture. Dip in flour mixture and turn to coat; shake off excess. Add chicken, skin side down, to skillet. Reduce heat to medium-low. Cover; cook until brown, about 12 minutes. Turn chicken over. Cook uncovered until cooked through, about 5 minutes for breasts and 10 minutes for legs and thighs; transfer to paper towels. Repeat with remaining chicken. (Salad and chicken can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.)

In a large heavy kettle cook garlic, onions, celery, and bell peppers in oil over moderately low heat, stirring occasionally, until softened. Add all remaining ingredients except shrimp and simmer, uncovered, 30 minutes, or until thickened. Stir in shrimp and cook, covered, over moderately high heat, stirring occasionally, until shrimp are cooked through, about 5 minutes.
Serve shrimp and sauce over coked rice.

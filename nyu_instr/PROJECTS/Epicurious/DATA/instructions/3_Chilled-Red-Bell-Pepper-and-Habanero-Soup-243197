Roast bell peppers on racks of gas burners over high heat (or on a broiler pan about 2 inches from broiler), turning with tongs, until skins are blackened, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let stand 20 minutes. Peel, then halve lengthwise, discarding stems and seeds.
Cut a shallow X in bottom of each tomato, then blanch tomatoes in simmering water 20 seconds and transfer to an ice bath. Peel and coarsely chop, reserving juices.
Cook onion, garlic, chiles, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in 2 tablespoons oil in a 3- to 4-quart heavy saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until softened and pale golden, about 8 minutes. Add tomatoes with juices, bell peppers, broth, and 1/4 teaspoon salt and simmer, covered, until peppers are tender, about 5 minutes.
Purée soup in 2 or 3 batches in a blender (use caution when blending hot liquids), drizzling remaining 1/4 cup oil into first batch with motor running. Quick-chill soup in a metal bowl set in an ice bath, stirring often, 10 to 15 minutes. Season with salt.

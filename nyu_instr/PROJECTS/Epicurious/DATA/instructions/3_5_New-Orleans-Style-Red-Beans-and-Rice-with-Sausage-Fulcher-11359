In a bowl soak beans in water to cover by 2 inches overnight. In a 6-quart heavy kettle combine all ingredients except 1/2 pound sausage. Bring mixture to a boil and simmer, covered, over moderate heat 1 1/2 hours. Remove lid and cook mixture at a bare simmer 1 hour more, adding more water if mixture is too thick.
Remove 1 cup bean mixture and mash to a paste. Stir bean paste and remaining 1/2 pound sausage into bean mixture and simmer 5 minutes. Serve bean mixture with rice.

In small bowl, pour tomato juice over bread cubes and let soak until very soft, about 30 minutes. Transfer to blender and purée until smooth. Add tomatoes, roughly chopped cucumber, garlic, 2 teaspoons salt, and parika and purée until very smooth. Strain through fine-mesh sieve into medium bowl, pressing on solids to extract all liquid. Discard solids, return liquid to blender, and add 1/4 cup vinegar. With motor running, slowly add 1 cup oil in slow steady stream, then blend until fully incorporated. Transfer gazpacho to airtight container and refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight.
In medium bowl, toss together finely diced cucumber, bell pepper, onion, ground black pepper, and remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1 teaspoon vinegar, and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Ladle gazpacho into bowls. Spoon chopped vegetable mixture into middle of each bowl, dividing evenly among bowls. Serve immediately.

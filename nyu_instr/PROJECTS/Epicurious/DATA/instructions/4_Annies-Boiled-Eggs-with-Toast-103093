1. Preheat the broiler. Place the rack 3-inches from the broiler.
2. Place the eggs in a saucepan and cover them by 1-inch with cold water. Place the pan over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Time the eggs for 2-1/2 minutes.
3. Toast the bread on both sides and butter each slice, preferably with lightly salted butter. Cut the bread into 1/4-inch thick sticks and arrange them on a warm plate.
4. After 2-1/2 minutes remove the eggs from the water, place them into egg cups and serve. The time it takes to get the eggs from the kitchen to the table will result in them being perfectly cooked. Immediately cut off the top of the egg. To eat, dip a mouillette, or toast stick, into the egg yolk, and enjoy!

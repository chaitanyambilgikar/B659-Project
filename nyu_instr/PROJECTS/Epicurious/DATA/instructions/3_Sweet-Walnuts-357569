1. Place 5 cups of the water in a pot and bring to a boil over high heat. Add the walnuts and stir. Allow the water to return to a boil and boil for 3 minutes. Turn off the heat and run cold water into the pot. Drain the nuts thoroughly in a strainer. Return the nuts to the pot, add 5 cups of the water, and bring to a boil over high heat. Allow the nuts to boil for 5 minutes, then drain again and set the walnuts aside to dry.
2. This next step requires a wok that is completely free of oil. Place the 6 tablespoons water in the wok and bring to a boil over high heat. Add the sugar and stir to dissolve with a spatula. Bring to boil and stir constantly for 2 minutes. Add the walnuts and continue to stir for about 8 minutes, or until the nuts are coated completely with the sugar syrup and the liquid in the wok has evaporated. As the walnuts become glazed with the syrup, take care to regulate the heat so neither the nuts nor the glaze burns.
3. Turn off the heat. Using a Chinese strainer, remove the walnuts and set aside on a plate. Wash the wok and the spatula with extremely hot water to remove the sugar residue and dry thoroughly.
4. Place the peanut oil in the wok, and heat it to 375ºF on a deep-frying thermometer. Place the walnuts on the strainer and lower them into the hot oil. Fry the walnuts, stirring with the spatula, for about 5 minutes, or until they turn a golden amber brown. Turn off the heat. Scoop the nuts from the oil with the strainer and allow to drain briefly.
5. Spread the nuts on a baking sheet and let cool completely. After 2 minutes, loosen the walnuts so they do not stick to one another. Serve the cooled nuts or transfer them to an airtight container and store as directed in the introduction.

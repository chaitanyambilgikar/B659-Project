Add white vinegar and salt to a large pot of water; bring to a simmer. Slide an egg white into pot slowly; let cook 30 seconds before adding another egg white.
Repeat with remaining egg whites. Poach until opaque, 2 to 3 minutes each; with a slotted spoon, move to a plate.
In a medium pan over low heat, sauté turkey bacon until crisp, 7 to 10 minutes. Set aside.
In a microwave-safe bowl, whisk together oils, red wine vinegar and mustard; season with salt and black pepper. Nuke vinaigrette 45 seconds. Toss frisée and turkey bacon with warm vinaigrette.
Divide frisée mixture between 2 bowls and create a nest in each; add 2 poached egg whites to each nest. Season with salt and black pepper and serve immediately.

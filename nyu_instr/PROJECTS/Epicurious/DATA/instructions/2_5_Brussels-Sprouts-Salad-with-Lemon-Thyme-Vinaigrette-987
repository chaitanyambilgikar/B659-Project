Cook Brussels sprouts in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender, about 8 minutes. Drain. Rinse with cold water and drain well. Transfer to medium bowl. Combine lemon juice and mustard in small bowl. Gradually whisk in oil. Add thyme. Season to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover Brussels sprouts and dressing separately and refrigerate. Bring to room temperature before continuing.)
Combine endive and radicchio on platter or in large shallow bowl. Toss with enough dressing to coat lightly. Mix Brussels sprouts with remaining dressing. Mound atop salad and serve.

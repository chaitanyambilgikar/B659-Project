Preheat oven to 350°F. Combine ice cream and butter in bowl. Add 1/2 cup flour; stir until soft dough forms. Coat hands with flour. Shape dough into ball; flatten into disk. Wrap in plastic; freeze until dough is firm, about 15 minutes.
Lightly grease baking sheet. Roll out dough on well-floured surface to 12 x 16-inch rectangle. Brush dough with jam, leaving 1/2-inch border at edges. Sprinkle with nuts and raisins. Starting at 1 long side, roll up dough, jelly roll style. Tuck ends under to enclose filling. Transfer strudel to prepared sheet. Using sharp knife, score top of dough into 1-inch sections, then brush with milk.
Bake strudel until golden, about 45 minutes. Run knife under strudel to loosen from sheet. Cool completely on baking sheet. Slice along score marks.

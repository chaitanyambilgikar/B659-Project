Preheat oven to 350°F.
Brush 1 side of baguette slices with 2 tablespoons oil and arrange, oiled sides up, on a baking sheet. Toast bread in middle of oven until golden on top, about 7 minutes, then transfer to a rack to cool. Leave oven on.
Stir together fresh and dried tomatoes, basil, vinegar, and 1/2 tablespoon oil.
Spread each toast with tapenade and top with a slice of goat cheese and a rounded teaspoon of tomato mixture. Arrange tartines on a baking sheet, then season with salt and pepper and drizzle with 1/2 tablespoon oil.
Bake tartines in middle of oven until cheese is softened, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a platter and drizzle with remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil.

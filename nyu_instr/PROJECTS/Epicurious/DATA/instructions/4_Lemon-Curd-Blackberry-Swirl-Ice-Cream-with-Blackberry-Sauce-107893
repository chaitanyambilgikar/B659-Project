For ice cream: Boil berries, 1/4 cup sugar, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, and corn syrup in small saucepan over medium-high heat until thick, stirring often, about 8 minutes. Strain berry mixture into small bowl, pressing on solids; chill syrup.
Meanwhile, combine cream, milk, and 1/2 cup sugar in heavy large saucepan. Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add bean. Bring mixture to simmer. Remove from heat. Whisk egg yolks and remaining 3/4 cup sugar in large bowl to blend. Whisk in remaining 2/3 cup lemon juice and lemon peel. Gradually whisk hot cream mixture into yolk mixture. Return mixture to saucepan. Stir over medium heat until custard thickens enough to coat back of spoon (do not boil), about 12 minutes. Strain custard into clean large bowl. Set bowl of custard over large bowl of ice water. Stir custard until cold. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
Process custard in ice cream maker according to manufacturer's instructions. Immediately spoon half of ice cream into 9x5x3-inch loaf pan. Spoon half of blackberry syrup atop ice cream in pan. Spoon remaining ice cream atop blackberry syrup. Top ice cream with remaining blackberry syrup. Cover and freeze until firm, at least 8 hours and up to 2 days.
For blackberry sauce: Combine blackberries, sugar, and lemon juice in medium bowl. Let stand until sugar dissolves and juices form, stirring occasionally, about 1 hour. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
Scoop ice cream into dessert bowls. Serve ice cream with blackberry sauce.

Cook broccoli rabe in a 4-quart pot of boiling salted water , uncovered, until tender, about 3 minutes. Drain well in a colander, then chop.
Cook anchovies and garlic in 1 1/2 tablespoons oil in a 10-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat, stirring, until garlic just begins to turn golden, about 1 minute. Add broccoli rabe and cook, stirring, 1 minute.
Heat a panini or sandwich press according to manufacturer's instructions until hot. (Alternatively, heat a well-seasoned ridged grill pan over moderate heat.)
Brush 4 center slices of bread on 1 side with remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons oil. (Reserve remainder of loaf for another use.) Put slices, oiled sides down, on a work surface, then divide half of cheese between 2 slices. Top with all of broccoli rabe mixture, remaining cheese, and remaining 2 bread slices, oiled sides up.
Put sandwiches on press, then pull down top onto sandwiches and cook until sandwiches are browned and crisp, 4 to 8 minutes. (If using grill pan, put a heavy pan on top of sandwiches and cook, turning sandwiches over once.)

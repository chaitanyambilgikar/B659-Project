To prepare either version of the olive salad, mix all the ingredients in a bowl. Cover, and refrigerate several hours or overnight, to let the flavors develop. This makes more salad than you need for one 8-inch sandwich. Extra olive salad will keep for a week or more and can be used in salads, sandwiches, etc.

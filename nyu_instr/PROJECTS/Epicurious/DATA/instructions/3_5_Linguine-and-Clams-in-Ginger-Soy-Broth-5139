Preheat oven to 400°F. Place 2 large baking sheets in oven to heat. Cut 4 sheets of foil, each about 18 inches long. Place 1 foil sheet on work surface. Arrange 1/4 cup cilantro on 1 half of foil. Top with 1 tablespoon broth, 1 1/2 teaspoons soy sauce, 1 1/2 teaspoons ginger, 1 teaspoon sesame oil, 1 teaspoon jalapeño and 1/2 teaspoon garlic. Arrange 8 clams atop. Fold foil over, enclosing contents completely and crimping edges tightly to seal. Repeat with remaining 3 foil sheets, cilantro, broth, soy sauce, ginger, sesame oil, jalapeño, garlic and clams. Place foil packets on heated baking sheets. Bake until clams open, about 20 minutes (discard any that do not open).
Divide linguine among 4 bowls. Open 1 foil packet over pasta in each bowl to retain juices. Sprinkle with bell pepper and green onions and serve.

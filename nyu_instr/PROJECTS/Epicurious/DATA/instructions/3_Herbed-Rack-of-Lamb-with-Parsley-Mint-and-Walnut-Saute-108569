For lamb: Place lamb racks on heavy large rimmed baking sheet. Brush lamb with 1 tablespoon oil. Sprinkle with 2 teaspoons coarse salt and pepper. Mix all herbs in small bowl; press firmly over meat side of lamb to adhere. Let stand 2 hours at room temperature. (Can be made 6 hours ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
Preheat oven to 425°F. Heat remaining 4 tablespoons oil in heavy large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Working in batches, add lamb, meat-and-herb side down, and cook until brown, about 4 minutes. Transfer racks to baking sheet, meat-and-herb side up. Roast lamb until meat thermometer inserted into center registers 125°F for medium-rare, about 13 minutes. Remove from oven and let stand 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, prepare sauté: Heat olive oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add shallots and sauté until soft, about 4 minutes. Add parsley and sauté until wilted, about 2 minutes. Add mint, 1/2 cup water, and lemon peel and cook until parsley is tender, about 3 minutes. Mix in walnuts, walnut oil, and lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper.
Cut lamb between bones into individual chops. Divide parsley sauté among 6 plates. Top with lamb chops and serve.

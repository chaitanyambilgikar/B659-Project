Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onions and sauté until they are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes and their reserved juices, the bulgur, and the allspice, cinnamon, and pepper. Sauté until all of the bulgur grains are coated and the spices are fragrant, about 10 minutes. Add the boiling water, cover, and bring to a boil.
Reduce the heat to medium and simmer for 15 minutes. Then slide a heat diffuser under the pot, reduce the heat to low, and cook until all the water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Serve warm.

Preheat oven to 375°F. Sift 2 cups flour, 1/2 teaspoon baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon baking soda and 1/4 teaspoon salt into medium bowl. Using electric mixer, cream 1/2 cup shortening and 3/4 cup sugar in large bowl. Beat in 1 egg, 1 teaspoon vanilla and 1 teaspoon orange peel. Mix in dry ingredients alternately with milk, beginning and ending with dry ingredients.
Lightly grease 2 large cookie sheets. Roll dough out on lightly floured surface to 1/8-inch thickness. Cut 3-inch-diameter rounds using cookie or biscuit cutter. Transfer dough rounds to prepared cookie sheets. Gather and reroll scraps. Cut additional cookies. Sprinkle cookies with sugar. Bake cookies until golden brown on edges, about 14 minutes. Transfer to rack and cool completely. (Can be prepared 1 week ahead. Store in airtight container.)

Preheat broiler.
In a small bowl stir together Parmesan and mayonnaise. Trim asparagus to fit bread and arrange asparagus in a skillet just large enough to hold it in one layer. Add 1/2 inch salted cold water and cook asparagus, covered, over moderately high heat 5 minutes, or until just tender. In a colander drain asparagus well.
Arrange bread on a baking sheet and butter top of each slice. Broil bread about 6 inches from heat until golden, about 2 minutes. Turn bread over and arrange ham on each slice, folding or trimming to fit if necessary. Arrange asparagus on ham and spread with Parmesan mixture. Broil sandwiches about 3 inches from heat until golden, 1 to 2 minutes.

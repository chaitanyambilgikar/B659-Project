Purée chiles, ginger, sesame seeds, garlic, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a mini-processor until paste forms. Transfer to a medium bowl. Stir in both oils and vinegar. Season dressing with salt. Add tuna; gently toss just to coat.
Place nori sheets on a work surface with short side facing you. Spread about 2 rounded tablespoons rice evenly on bottom third of each sheet. Divide tuna mixture among rolls, spooning over rice. Top with fillings. Roll into cones or log shapes, using a few grains of cooked rice as "glue" to seal.

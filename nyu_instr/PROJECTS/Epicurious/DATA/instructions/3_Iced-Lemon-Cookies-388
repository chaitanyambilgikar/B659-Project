FOR COOKIES: Preheat oven to 350°F. Line 2 baking sheets with foil. Using electric mixer, beat sugar, unsalted butter, vanilla extract and grated lemon peel in large bowl until blended. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition (mixture may appear curdled). Continue beating 1 minute. Combine flour and baking powder in small bowl. Add to butter mixture and stir to form soft sticky dough.
Spoon dough into pastry bag fitted with 3/8-inch-wide round tip. Pipe 2-inch-diameter rings onto prepared sheets, spacing apart. Using fingertips dipped into water, press ends of each ring together into smooth ring. Bake until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare icing.
FOR ICING: Melt butter in heavy medium saucepan over low heat. Add sugar, 2 tablespoons water, lemon juice and vanilla extract and whisk until sugar melts and mixture is heated through. Thin with more water if icing is too thick to brush.
Remove cookies from oven. Immediately brush warm icing over hot cookies. Cool iced cookies on sheets 2 minutes. Transfer on rack and cool completely. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Store in airtight container.)

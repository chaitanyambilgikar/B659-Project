Mix parsley and orange peel in small bowl. Mix coriander, brown sugar and black pepper in medium bowl. (Can be made 8 hours ahead. Cover separately. Chill parsley mixture. Store spice mixture at room temperature.)
Sprinkle salmon with salt. Coat salmon on all sides with spice mixture. Melt 1/2 tablespoon butter and 1/2 tablespoon oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add 3 salmon fillets. Cook fish until crust is golden and center is just opaque, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer fish to platter. Tent with foil to keep warm. Wipe skillet. Repeat with remaining butter, oil and salmon. Spoon parsley mixture atop salmon and serve.

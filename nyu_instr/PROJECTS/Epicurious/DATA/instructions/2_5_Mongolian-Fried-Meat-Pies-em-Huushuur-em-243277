Make dough: Stir together flour and salt, then stir in warm water until a dough forms. Transfer to a floured surface and knead briefly. Form into 16 (1 1/2-inch) balls. Let stand, covered with an inverted large bowl, at room temperature 1 to 2 hours.
Make filling while dough stands: Mince and mash garlic to a paste with 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, then vigorously stir together with lamb, onion, scallions, and water in a bowl.
Form and fry pies: Preheat oven to 250°F.
Roll out 1 ball of dough into a 3- to 4-inch round on a floured surface with a floured rolling pin. Put about 2 tablespoons filling to one side on round, flattening filling slightly, and fold other half over it to form a half-moon. Press edges together to seal, forcing out air. Starting at one end of curve, fold edge over in triangles (each fold should overlap previous one), pressing as you go and pressing last fold under (this will help seal). Repeat with remaining dough and filling.
Meanwhile, heat 1 1/2 to 2 inches oil to 350°F in a deep 4- to 5-quart heavy pot.
Fry pies, 4 at a time, until golden and meat is just cooked through, about 6 minutes. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Return oil to 350°F and skim off any blackened bits between batches. Keep pies warm on a baking sheet in oven.

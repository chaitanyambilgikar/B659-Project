1. Preheat the oven to 350°:F. Combine the sugar, spices and salt in a bowl; reserve. In a separate bowl, toss the nuts with the egg white; then toss nuts well with the sugar-spice mixture.
2. Spread the nuts out on a baking sheet, separating them as much as possible. Bake for 15 minutes. Using a metal spatula, scrape up the nuts and break them apart; return to the oven for 5 minutes more to dry them thoroughly. Let cool completely at room temperature. Before serving, mix in the dried cherries.

Make peach custard for ice cream: Slice peaches 1/4 inch thick, then toss with 1/4 cup sugar and lemon juice in a bowl. Let stand 30 minutes.
While peaches are standing, bring cream just to a boil in a heavy saucepan. Whisk together yolks, remaining 1/2 cup sugar, and salt in a bowl, then add cream in a slow stream, whisking. Pour into saucepan and cook over moderately low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until it coats back of spoon and registers 170°F on an instant-read thermometer (do not let boil). Pour through a very fine sieve into a clean bowl and cool, stirring occasionally.
Purée peaches in batches in a blender until very smooth and force through very fine sieve into custard, pressing hard on and discarding solids. Whisk in extracts and chill, covered, until cold, 2 to 3 hours. (Do not chill longer than 3 hours or custard will discolor.)
Make praline while custard chills: Lightly butter a small baking sheet or a sheet of foil.
Bring sugar and water to a boil in a small heavy saucepan, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Boil syrup without stirring, washing down any sugar crystals on side of pan with a pastry brush dipped in cold water, until syrup turns a golden caramel. Remove from heat and stir in almonds. Pour praline onto baking sheet and cool completely.
Break praline into pieces and pulse in a food processor until finely ground with some small pieces remaining.
Freeze ice cream: Freeze peach custard in ice cream maker, then transfer to a bowl and keep in freezer while assembling bombes.
Assemble bombes: Beat cream in a bowl with an electric mixer until it just holds stiff peaks, then fold in vanilla and crushed praline.
Spoon about 1/2 cup ice cream into 1 paper cup and spread it evenly over bottom and about two-thirds of the way up side of cup, forming a well. Spoon a rounded 1/4 cup praline filling into well and top with another 1/4 cup ice cream, spreading evenly to cover filling. Cover cup tightly with foil and put in freezer. Make 5 more bombes in same manner. Freeze bombes at least 8 hours and up to 2 days.
Make peach syrup: Chop peaches, then bring to a boil with sugar in a 3- to 4-quart saucepan over moderate heat, covered, stirring occasionally until sugar is dissolved. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, until peaches are very soft and have given off liquid, about 15 minutes. Pour peaches and syrup through a fine sieve into a bowl, pressing on and discarding solids. Stir in lemon juice and cool syrup. Chill, covered, until cold.
To serve, carefully tear off each paper cup. Invert bombes onto plates and halve each with a sharp knife. Let stand about 5 minutes to soften slightly, then drizzle about 2 tablespoons peach syrup around each serving.

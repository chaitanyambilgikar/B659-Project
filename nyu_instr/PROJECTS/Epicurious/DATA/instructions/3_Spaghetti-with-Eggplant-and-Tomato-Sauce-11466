In a large heavy saucepan cook the onion and the garlic in 2 tablespoons of the oil over the moderately low heat, stirring occasionally, until the onion is softened, add the tomatoes with the juice, and simmer the sauce, uncovered, breaking up the tomatoes and stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes, or until it is thickened.
While the sauce is simmering, cut the eggplant into 1/2-inch dice, divide it between 2-jelly-roll pans, and drizzle it with the remaining 4 tablespoons oil. Bake the eggplant on the upper and lower racks of a preheated 400°.F. oven for 10 minutes, stir it and switch the pan positions in the oven. Bake the eggplant for 10 minutes more, or until it is very tender and golden, and stir it into the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.
In a kettle of boiling salted water boil the spaghetti until it is al dente and drain it well. Divide the spaghetti among dinner plates and spoon the sauce in the center of each serving.

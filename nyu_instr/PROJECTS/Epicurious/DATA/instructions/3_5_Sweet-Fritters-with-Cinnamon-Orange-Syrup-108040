Bring brown sugar, 1 cup water, and orange juice to boil in heavy medium saucepan over high heat, stirring until sugar dissolves. Boil until syrup reduces to 2 cups, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and whisk in cinnamon.
Combine remaining 1 cup water, butter, sugar, and salt in medium saucepan. Stir over medium heat until butter melts. Remove saucepan from heat and add flour. Using wooden spoon, stir until smooth. Return saucepan to heat and stir until mixture thickens and comes away from sides of saucepan, about 2 minutes. Transfer mixture to large bowl. Cool 5 minutes. Using electric mixer, add eggs 1 at a time, beating until dough is thick and smooth after each addition.
Add enough oil to heavy large saucepan to reach depth of 2 inches. Attach deep-fry thermometer and heat oil to 375°F. Working in batches, add 1 heaping teaspoonful batter to oil for each fritter. Fry until golden and tripled in size, about 8 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer fritters to paper towels to drain. Mound fritters on serving platter. Dust with powdered sugar and drizzle with cinnamon syrup. Serve, passing remaining syrup separately.

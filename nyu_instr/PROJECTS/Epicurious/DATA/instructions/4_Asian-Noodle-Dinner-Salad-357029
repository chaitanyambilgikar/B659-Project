Noodles Take a quarter of the package of noodles for each serving and place in boiling water for 3 to 4 minutes. Cook only until just soft (al dente) but not too soft; separate the strands while boiling. Drain in colander and immediately rinse with cold water. Cool noodles in the refrigerator. Mix with other ingredients and dressing.

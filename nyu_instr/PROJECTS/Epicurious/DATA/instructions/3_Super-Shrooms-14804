Preheat the oven to 350°F. Remove stems from the mushrooms. Wipe the caps clean. Arrange the caps, upside down, in single layer in a baking dish, preferably glass.
Rinse and finely chop the stems. In a mixing bowl, combine chopped stems with crab, onions, cream cheese, mayonnaise, and Tabasco. Add a little celery or garlic if desired. Salt to taste. Fill each mushroom cap with some of the mixture.
Add enough water to cover the bottom of the baking dish. Sprinkle each cap with Parmesan cheese. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until they are hot through and the cheese has browned.

Cook potatoes in large pot of boiling salted water until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain. Cool completely.
Cut potatoes in half. Combine potatoes, tuna, paprika and oil in large bowl. Sprinkle with salt. Toss to coat. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.) Alternate potato halves and tuna on skewers.
Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Place smoke chips in 8 x 6-inch foil packet with open top. Set atop coals 5 minutes before grilling kebabs. Grill kebabs until tuna is just cooked through, turning occasionally, about 8 minutes.
Spoon Basque Tomato Sauce onto plates. Arrange kebabs atop sauce; serve.

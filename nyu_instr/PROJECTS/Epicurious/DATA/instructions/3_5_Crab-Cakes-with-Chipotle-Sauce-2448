For Sauce: Mix all ingredients in bowl. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.
For Cakes Preheat oven to 350°F. Spread Masa Harina on heavy baking sheet. Bake until lightly toasted, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. Cool.
Mix crabmeat, bell pepper, mayonnaise, cilantro, lime juice and lemon peel in medium bowl. Mix in 1/2 cup toasted Masa Harina. Season to taste with salt. Shape crab mixture into twelve 2 1/2-inch-diameter patties, using scant 1/3 cup mixture for each. Place remaining Masa Harina in shallow dish. Add crab cakes 1 at a time, turning to coat. Transfer to baking sheet. (Can be prepared 4 hours ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add crab cakes in batches and cook until browned and heated through, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to plates. Serve with sauce.

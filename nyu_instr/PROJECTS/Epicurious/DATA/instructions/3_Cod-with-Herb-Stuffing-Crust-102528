Preheat oven to 425°F. Place stuffing mix, parsley and lemon peel in processor and grind finely. Transfer crumb mixture to plate. Sprinkle fish with salt and pepper; brush with melted butter. Roll fish in crumb mixture to coat completely.
Arrange fish on small baking sheet. Drizzle with any remaining butter. Bake fish until crumb crust is golden and fish is just opaque in center, about 15 minutes. Divide fish between 2 plates. Garnish with lemon wedges.

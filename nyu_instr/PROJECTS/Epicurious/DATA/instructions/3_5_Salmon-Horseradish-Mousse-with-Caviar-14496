In a small saucepan sprinkle gelatin over water and let soften 1 minute. Gently heat mixture over moderately low heat, stirring until gelatin dissolves (do not let boil).
In a food processor purée onion. Add gelatin mixture and all remaining ingredients except salmon roe and purée until smooth.
Lightly oil a 1-quart terrine or loaf pan (8 1/2 by 3 1/4 by 2 1/2 inches) and spread half of mousse evenly on bottom. Gently spread salmon roe evenly over mousse. Spoon remaining mousse evenly over salmon roe. Chill mousse, covered, at least 12 hours and up to 4 days.
Just before serving, run a thin knife around edges of terrine or loaf pan and dip terrine or loaf pan in hot water 5 to 10 seconds. Invert mousse onto a platter.
Serve mousse with bread or crackers.

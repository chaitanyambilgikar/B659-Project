1. Combine the oil, garlic, and anchovies in a small bowl; mash into a paste.
2. Place the paste in a saucepan along with the tomatoes, olives, capers, oregano, and red-pepper flakes. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer, uncovered; stirring occasionally, cook until slightly thickened, about 20 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and stir in the parsley. (Makes about 4 cups of sauce.)
3. Serve the pasta in shallow bowls, topped with the sauce. Pass the Parmesan!

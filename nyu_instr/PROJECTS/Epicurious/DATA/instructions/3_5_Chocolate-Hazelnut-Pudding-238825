Stir cornstarch with 1/2 cup of the milk in a bowl until cornstarch completely dissolves. Heat remaining 1 1/2 cups milk, chocolate, sugar and salt in a small saucepan over medium-low heat, whisking occasionally, until chocolate melts. Raise heat to medium; cook, whisking occasionally, until almost boiling (steam will rise from the surface). Stir cornstarch-milk mixture again until smooth; add to saucepan in a thin stream, constantly whisking. Bring pudding to a simmer, continuing to whisk. Simmer, constantly whisking, 1 1/2 minutes more. Pour pudding into a bowl or four 5-ounce cups; press plastic wrap against the surface of pudding to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate at least 2 hours. Serve cold.

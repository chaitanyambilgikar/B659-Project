Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper. Melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken, mushrooms, leek and tarragon. Sauté 8 minutes. Add wine and cream. Reduce heat to medium. Cover skillet; simmer until chicken is cooked through, about 2 minutes. Uncover; simmer until mushrooms and leek are tender and sauce thickens enough to coat spoon, about 2 minutes longer. Season with salt and pepper.

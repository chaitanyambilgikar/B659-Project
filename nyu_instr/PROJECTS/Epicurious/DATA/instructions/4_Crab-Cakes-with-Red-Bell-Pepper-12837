In a bowl combine the crab meat, the salt, and black pepper to taste. In a small saucepan cook the bell pepper in 3 tablespoons of the butter over moderately low heat, stirring, until it is softened. Remove the pan from the heat, stir in the lemon juice, the beaten egg, and the Worcestershire sauce, and stir the mixture into the crab meat. Add the chopped hard-boiled egg and the bread crumbs, combine the mixture gently but thoroughly, and form it into 4 patties, each about 1/2 inch thick.
In a large heavy skillet heat the oil with the remaining 1 tablespoon butter over moderately high heat until the foam subsides and in the fat sauté the crab cakes, turning them carefully, for 4 to 5 minutes on each side, or until they are golden brown and crisp. Serve the crab cakes with the lemon wedges, the remaining hard-boiled egg, and the tartar sauce.

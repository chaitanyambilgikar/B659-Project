Grilling Method: Indirect/Medium Heat
Remove neck and giblets and pat dry chicken with paper towels. Brush chicken all over with oil and season with 2 tablespoons dry rub or simply with salt and pepper. Set aside.
Open beer can, pour out about 1/4 cup of the beer, and make an extra hole in top of the can with church-key can opener. Sprinkle the remaining tablespoon of the dry rub inside beer can (it might fizz up a little bit at the top, but don't worry, that is normal).
Hold chicken above the can of beer and slide the chicken over the can, making sure the legs are in front of the can. The legs will act as a tripod, steadying the chicken as it cooks. The chicken will appear to be "sitting" on the grate. Fold the wings back behind the chicken—this is called "wings akimbo."
Place chicken on the beer can in the center of the grill's cooking grate. Make sure the legs are in front of the can, supporting the chicken.
Cook chicken for 1 to 1 1/2 hours or until the internal temperature registers 165°F in the breast area and 180°F in the thigh. Remove from grill and let rest for 10 minutes before carving.

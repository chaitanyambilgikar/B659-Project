Put steak on a wire rack set on a rimmed baking sheet. Pat dry with paper towels. Season with 1/2 teaspoon salt per side. Chill uncovered for up to 3 hours. Remove steak from refrigerator 1 hour before grilling and let come to room temperature. Pat dry with paper towels. Season again with 1/2 teaspoon salt; press in 1/2 teaspoon pepper per side so pieces adhere.
Build a two-zone fire in a charcoal grill for direct (medium-high coals) and indirect (medium-low coals) heat. Alternatively, heat a gas grill to high just before cooking, leaving one burner on low. Sear steak over direct heat, flipping once, until nicely charred, 3–4 minutes per side. (If a flare-up occurs, use tongs to gently slide the steak to a cooler part of the grill.) Move steak to indirect heat and continue grilling, flipping once, 3–4 minutes per side. Using tongs, lift steak and sear both edges (the bone side and the fat-cap side) for 1–2 minutes per side to render out some of the fat. Grill steak to desired temperature, 14–18 minutes total or until an instant-read thermometer registers 120°F for rare (steak will carry over to 125°F, or medium-rare, as it rests).
Transfer steak to a carving board; let rest for 10 minutes. Slice across the grain, season with coarse sea salt, and serve.

Heat 1/2 tbsp oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Season fish with salt and pepper and cook (skin side up, first) 2 or 3 minutes per side. Remove fish from skillet. Return skillet to heat; cook garlic, ginger and 1/4 cup onion until tender. Add coconut milk, lime juice and cilantro and bring to a boil. Add soy and hot sauces and fish; simmer 1 minute. Heat remaining 1/2 tbsp oil in a separate, large skillet over medium-high heat. Sauté remaining 1/4 cup onion, tomatoes, bell peppers and spinach until greens are just wilted. Serve fish over veggies with rice.

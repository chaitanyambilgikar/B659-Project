Bring milk, coarse salt, and nutmeg to simmer in heavy large saucepan over medium heat. Turn heat to very low; gradually whisk in semolina. Cook until mixture is very thick, whisking constantly, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Whisk in egg yolks, then Parmesan cheese and 2 tablespoons butter.
Pour semolina into 13x9x2-inch baking pan; spread evenly. Cover pan tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 4 hours. DO AHEAD: Semolina can be made 2 days ahead. Keep chilled.
Preheat oven to 400°F. Coat large rimmed baking sheet with remaining 1 tablespoon butter. Cut chilled semolina into twelve 3-inch squares. Carefully arrange semolina squares on prepared baking sheet, spacing apart. Bake gnocchi until bottoms brown, about 15 minutes.

Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; sauté until tender, about 5 minutes. Add 1/4 cup basil, oregano and dried red pepper and stir 1 minute. Add stewed tomatoes, diced tomatoes, artichoke hearts and lemon juice and simmer until sauce thickens slightly and artichokes are tender, about 30 minutes.(Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
Cook spaghetti in large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite. Drain.
Meanwhile, bring sauce to a simmer. Stir in shrimp and simmer until just cooked through, about 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Add spaghetti to sauce and toss to coat. Transfer to large bowl. Sprinkle with additional chopped fresh basil. Serve, passing Parmesan separately.

Preheat oven to 400°F. Generously butter 13 x 9 x 2-inch glass baking dish. Heat oil in medium skillet over medium heat. Add onions and jalapeños; sauté until onions are tender, about 5 minutes.
Mix cornmeal, flour, baking powder, salt and baking soda in large bowl. Whisk buttermilk, yolks and butter in medium bowl to blend. Mix buttermilk mixture into dry ingredients just until moist and blended. Stir in onion mixture.
Using electric mixer, beat egg whites in another large bowl until soft peaks form. Add sugar and beat until whites are stiff but not dry. Stir 1/3 of whites into batter to lighten. Fold in remaining whites. Transfer batter to prepared pan. Bake until corn bread is golden and tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 25 minutes. (Can be prepared 8 hours ahead. Cool; cover with foil and store at room temperature. Rewarm covered in 350°F oven for 10 minutes before serving.) Cut into 20 squares and serve warm.

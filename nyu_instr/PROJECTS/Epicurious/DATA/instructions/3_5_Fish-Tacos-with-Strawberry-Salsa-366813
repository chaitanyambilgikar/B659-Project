Heat oven to 450°F. Coat a rimmed baking sheet with cooking spray. Place fish on baking sheet, smooth side down (if fillets); coat with cooking spray; season with cumin, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper. Stack tortillas, sprinkle with a few drops of water, and wrap tightly in foil. Cook fish and tortillas until fish is opaque and flakes easily with a fork but is still moist, and tortillas are hot, 10 to 15 minutes. In a bowl, combine strawberries, jalapeño, chives, lemon juice, remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and remaining 1/8 teaspoon pepper; stir. Flake fish into big pieces; unwrap tortillas. Divide fish, strawberry salsa and cabbage evenly among tortillas. Fold and serve.

Generously butter two 9-inch-diameter cake pans with 2-inch-high sides. Place bread in very large bowl. Pour 4 cups milk over. Let bread soak until soft, about 10 minutes. Squeeze bread slices over same bowl, extracting as much milk as possible. Transfer bread to medium bowl. Transfer milk from bowl to 2-cup measuring cup. If necessary, add more milk to equal 1 1/3 cups total. Return milk to very large bowl. Add eggs, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and 1 1/2 teaspoons pepper to milk; whisk to blend well.
Arrange 1/4 of bread in each prepared pan. Sprinkle 1/2 cup chives over each. Sprinkle each with 1/4 of Brie cheese, then 2 tablespoons parsley and 2 tablespoons tarragon. Sprinkle 3 tablespoons Swiss cheese over each. Top each with half of remaining bread. Pour half of milk-egg mixture over each. Sprinkle 1/2 cup chives, 1/4 of Brie, 2 tablespoons parsley and 2 tablespoons tarragon over each. Sprinkle 3 tablespoons Swiss cheese and 1/3 cup Parmesan cheese over each. Dot each with 1 tablespoon butter. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.)
Preheat oven to 350°F. Bake puddings uncovered until puffed and deep golden brown on top, about 1 hour 10 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes. Cut into wedges and serve.

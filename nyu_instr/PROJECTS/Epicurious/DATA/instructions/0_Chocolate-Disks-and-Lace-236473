Line three cookie sheets with waxed paper. Trace one 8-inch round on each, using cake pan bottom as aid. Invert paper. Melt chocolate in top of double boiler over simmering water, stirring until smooth. Remove pan from heat. Spoon 2 1/2 tablespoons chocolate into center of each of 2 traced circles. Spread with spatula to fill circles completely. Spoon remaining chocolate into parchment cone or small pastry bag fitted with fine round tip. Pipe chocolate around traced border of third circle. Pipe chocolate inside circle in thick lacy design, making certain design touches border. Fill in three areas of design with chocolate, if desired. Pipe more chocolate atop pattern to form double thick lace. Freeze disks and lace until firm, about 1 hour (chocolate may curl slightly). (Can be prepared 3 days ahead. Cover tightly.)
Remove 1 chocolate disk from freezer and invert onto piece of waxed paper. Gently peel top paper off chocolate. Return disk to freezer. Repeat with second disk and chocolate lace. Freeze disks and lace until ready to use.

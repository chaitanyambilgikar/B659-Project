Cook linguine until just tender but firm to bite. Drain, reserving 1 cup cooking liquid.
Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil in large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add anchovies and 2 garlic cloves, then breadcrumbs. Cook breadcrumbs until golden, tossing to distribute evenly, about 5 minutes. Scrape crumbs onto plate and cool.
Heat remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons oil in same skillet over medium heat. Add tomatoes and remaining garlic clove. Cover; cook until tomatoes begin to break down, 3 to 4 minutes. Using fork, crush 1/4 of tomatoes. Add pasta, basil, cheese, and 1/2 cup reserved cooking liquid to tomatoes. Toss, adding more liquid if dry. Mix in half of crumbs. Season pasta with salt and pepper.
Transfer pasta to large shallow bowl; top with remaining breadcrumbs and serve.

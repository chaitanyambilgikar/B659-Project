Soak fava beans in water to cover generously overnight.
The next day, drain the beans and place in a food processor with garlic clove and purée until ground. Add parsley; the green tops of the scallions; the ground cumin; the baking powder; the salt; and the fresh cilantro. Pulse and process until thoroughly ground and the mixture comes together. Turn out into a bowl, with your hands, and form into 2-inch balls. Flatten each ball slightly and roll in toasted sesame seeds. Place on a pan, cover, and refrigerate until you are ready to fry.
Heat 2 inches of vegetable oil in a saucepan to 365 degrees. Drop a few ta'miyya into the oil and fry until golden brown, 5 to 8 minutes. Drain on paper towls and serve with tehina as an appetizer. Or stuff them with chopped lettuce and tehina into pita for lunch.

Pat pork dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. In an ovenproof skillet heat oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and brown pork on all sides. Roast pork in skillet in middle of oven until a meat thermometer registers 155°F., about 20 minutes.
Transfer pork to a cutting board and cool completely. Cut pork into 1-inch-long strips and put in a small bowl. Add hoisin sauce and honey, stirring to combine, and season with salt and pepper.
Brush 1 crêpe lightly with plum sauce and cut into 4 wedges. Arrange 3 or 4 pork strips on each wedge parallel to 1 cut edge and top with 6 radish strips, 4 chive pieces, and some scallion strips. Roll up crêpe around filling into a come, tucking in pointed end as rolling. Make 31 more hors d'oeuvres with remaining crêpes, plum sauce, pork, and vegetables in same manner.

Preheat oven to 400°F. Finely grind nuts in processor. Add panko and blend, using on/off turns. Transfer to shallow baking dish. Mix mustard, basil, dill and rosemary in medium bowl. Spread mustard mixture over both sides of each chicken breast. Dip chicken breasts into nut mixture, coating completely. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add 2 chicken breasts to skillet and cook until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to baking sheet. Remove any leftover nuts from skillet. Repeat with remaining 2 chicken breasts, adding more oil to skillet as necessary. Bake chicken until cooked through, about 7 minutes. Spoon Mustard-Cream Sauce over chicken and serve immediately.

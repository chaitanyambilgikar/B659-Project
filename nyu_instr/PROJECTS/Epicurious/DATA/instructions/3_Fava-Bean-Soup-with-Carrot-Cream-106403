For soup: Cook fava beans in large pot of boiling salted water 5 minutes. Drain. Cool. Cut off tip of each pod and squeeze beans into medium bowl. Peel skin from each bean (to yield about 3/4 cup beans).
Heat oil in large pot over medium heat. Add onion and sauté until tender, about 10 minutes. Add beans, potato, carrot, broth, 1 1/2 cups water, and wine. Cover and simmer until vegetables are soft, about 15 minutes. Cool slightly. Stir in parsley. Working in batches, puree soup in blender. Return to pot. Stir in cream. Season with salt and pepper. (Soup can be made 1 day ahead; cover and chill.)
For carrot cream: Puree all ingredients in blender. Transfer to bowl. Chill at least 15 minutes and up to 3 hours.
Strain carrot cream into medium bowl, pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Using electric mixer, beat carrot cream until soft peaks form. Bring soup to simmer. Ladle into bowls. Top with dollop of carrot cream.

Place beans in large Dutch oven. Add enough water to cover by 5 inches. Simmer until beans are tender, about 2 hours.
Heat oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Add peppers, onion and garlic. Sauté until brown, about 10 minutes. Add oregano and cumin; stir 1 minute. Add to beans. Add 4 cups water. Bring to boil. Reduce heat; simmer until mixture thickens, stirring often, about 45 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover; chill. Bring to simmer before serving thinning with more water if too thick.)
Ladle soup into bowls. Serve with sour cream, cilantro and jalapeños.

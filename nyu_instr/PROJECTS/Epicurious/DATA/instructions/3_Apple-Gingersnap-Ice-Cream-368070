1. In a saucepan over medium-high heat, bring the milk and cream to a simmer, then remove from the heat. Meanwhile, in a standing mixer fitted with a whisk attachment or using a hand-held mixer, beat the egg yolks with the sugar on high speed until pale and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Reduce the speed to low and add 1/2 cup of the hot cream-milk mixture into the egg mixture. This will slowly bring up the temperature of the eggs so they won't curdle when you mix them with the rest of the hot cream.
2. Pour the egg mixture back into the saucepan with the cream-milk mixture and stir to combine. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture reaches 175°F on an instant-read thermometer (this is the point at which it will thicken noticeably), about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat, add the salt and vanilla extract, and pour through a strainer into a bowl. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to overnight.
3. Meanwhile, prepare the apples: In a skillet, stir the apples with 3 tablespoons water and the cinnamon over medium heat. Cook until the apples are tender and translucent, and the water has evaporated, 8 to 10 minutes. Use a fork to mash the apples to the consistency of chunky applesauce. Transfer to a bowl and refrigerate, covered, until you're ready to freeze the ice cream.
4. Once chilled, your ice cream base should register between 35°F and 40°F on an instant-read thermometer. If it doesn't, you can set the bowl over some ice and stir to quickly cool it. Stir the apples and gingersnaps into the ice cream base. Pour the mixture into an ice-cream maker, leaving an inch at the top to allow for expansion, and prepare according to the manufacturer's instructions. Eat immediately or pour into an airtight plastic container and freeze for up to 1 week.

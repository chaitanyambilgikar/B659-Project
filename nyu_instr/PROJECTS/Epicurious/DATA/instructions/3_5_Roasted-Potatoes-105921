Preheat oven to 450°F.
Cover potatoes with salted cold water by 1 inch in a 6-quart pot, then simmer, uncovered, until just tender, 12 to 20 minutes, depending on type of potato. Drain in a colander and pat dry.
Toss potatoes with goose fat in a bowl. Spread potatoes in 1 layer in a large roasting pan and roast in middle of oven, turning once, until golden, about 30 minutes. Toss with salt and pepper.

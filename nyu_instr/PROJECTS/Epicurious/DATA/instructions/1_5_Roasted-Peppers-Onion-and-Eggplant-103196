Preheat oven to 400°F.
Place whole peppers in one third of an oiled, large 1-inch-deep baking pan. Brush cut sides of eggplants with 1/2 tablespoon oil and arrange next to peppers in pan. Toss onion with 1 tablespoon oil and spread in remaining third of pan.
Roast vegetables, turning peppers occasionally, until skins of peppers blister on all sides, about 40 minutes. Transfer peppers to a bowl, cover, and let steam 10 minutes. Continue roasting eggplants and onion until tender and browned, 20 to 30 minutes more, and keep warm, covered.
Peel peppers and cut into 1/2-inch-thick strips, discarding stems and seeds. Season vegetables with sea salt and pepper. Serve eggplants topped with peppers and onion. Drizzle with remaining oil and season with sea salt.

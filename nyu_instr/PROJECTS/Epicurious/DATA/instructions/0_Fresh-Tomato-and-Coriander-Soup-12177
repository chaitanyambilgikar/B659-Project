In a blender blend the tomato juice, the jalapeño pepper, and the sugar until the mixture is smooth. Strain the mixture through a sieve set over a bowl, discard the solids, and stir in the orange juice, the coriander, and enough water to thin the soup to the desired consistency. Season the soup with salt and pepper, chill it, covered, for 1 hour, or until it is cold, and serve it with the sour cream.

Preheat over to 350°F. Wrap beets in foil. Bake until tender, about 1 hour. Cool slightly. Peel beets. Halve lengthwise, then slice. Transfer to medium bowl and set aside.
Combine lemon juice, mustard and celery seeds in bowl. Gradually whisk in oil. Season with salt and pepper. Add half of dressing to beets and mix to coat. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover beets and chill. Cover remaining dressing and let stand at room temperature.)
Place endive in another medium bowl. Add remaining dressing and toss to coat. Mound endive in center of large platter. Surround with beets. Sprinkle Roquefort and chives over and serve.

Prick the potatoes a few times with a fork and bake them in the middle of a preheated 375°F. oven for 1 hour. In a large skillet melt the butter over moderate heat, in it cook the celery and the garlic, covered, for 10 minutes, and cook the mixture, uncovered, stirring, for 10 minutes more, or until the celery is tender. Transfer the mixture to a food processor and purée it. Peel the baked potatoes and force them through a ricer into a bowl. (Alternatively, the potatoes may be mashed with a potato masher.) Stir in the celery purée, salt and pepper to taste, and enough of the milk to reach the desired consistency. The mashed celery potatoes may be made 1 day in advance and kept covered and chilled.

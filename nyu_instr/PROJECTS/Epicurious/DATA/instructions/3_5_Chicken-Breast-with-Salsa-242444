1. Place chicken in a bowl and toss well with the lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate for 15 minutes, turning once.
2. Remove the chicken from the marinade, then grill or broil 4 inches from the heat source, basting with marinade until slightly golden and cooked through, 3 or 4 minutes a side. Let chicken rest for 3 minutes.
3. Slice each breast into 1/2-inch slices on the diagonal and reform on two dinner plates; top with the salsa. Sprinkle with the tablespoon of cilantro. Serve immediately.
Salsa: Toss 1 diced avocado in a bowl with 1 tablespoon lime juice. Fold in 1 diced tomato and 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro. Season to taste.

Rinse salted capers, if using, and soak in cold water to cover by 3 inches 30 minutes (to remove excess salt). In a small bowl whisk together flour, beer, and salt. Let mixture stand 15 minutes. Drain capers and dry well. Stir capers into batter.
In a small saucepan heat 1 inch oil over moderate heat until a deep-fat thermometer registers 375°F. With a slotted spoon remove capers, about 10 at a time, from batter. With fingers carefully drop coated capers into oil and fry until golden, about 1 minute. With another slotted spoon transfer capers as fried to paper towels to drain. (Batter-fried capers will stay crisp, uncovered, at room temperature 1 day.)

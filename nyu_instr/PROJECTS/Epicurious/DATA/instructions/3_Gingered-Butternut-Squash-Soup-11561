In a heavy saucepan cook the onion in the oil over moderately low heat, stirring, until it is softened, add the squash and 2 cups of the water, and simmer the mixture for 15 minutes, or until the squash is very tender. Stir in the garlic paste and the gingerroot and simmer the soup for 1 minute. In a blender purée the soup with the remaining 1/2 cup water and stir in the parsley and salt and pepper to taste.

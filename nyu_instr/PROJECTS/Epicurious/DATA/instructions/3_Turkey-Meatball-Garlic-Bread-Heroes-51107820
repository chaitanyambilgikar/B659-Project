Make Tomato Sauce: Purée tomatoes with their purée in a blender.
Heat oil in a large heavy pot over medium-high heat until it shimmers, then sauté onion until golden, 5 to 6 minutes. Add garlic and sauté 1 minute. Add tomato purée, sugar, and salt and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until thickened, 30 to 35 minutes.
Make Meatballs While Sauce Simmers: Stir together bread crumbs and milk in a large bowl and let stand for 10 minutes.
Stir in eggs, cheese, garlic, parsley, oregano, and salt, then add turkey and blend with your hands until just combined well (do not overmix).
Form 1 1/2-tablespoon portions into meatballs and arrange on 2 well-oiled large, heavy, rimmed baking sheets.
Make Garlic Bread: Stir together butter, oil, garlic, salt, cheese, parsley, and pepper in a bowl. Spread about 2 rounded teaspoons garlic butter onto both split sides of each bun. Arrange buns, buttered sides up, on a large baking sheet.
Broil Meatballs and Garlic Bread: Preheat broiler.
Broil meatballs 3 to 4 inches from heat, turning over once, until golden and just cooked through (165°F on instant-read thermometer), 5 to 8 minutes.
Broil buns, buttered sides only, until golden, 30 seconds to 1 minute, watching closely (buns brown fast).
Assemble Heroes: Spoon some sauce on each bun, then top with 4 meatballs (depending on size of buns), and drizzle with more sauce.

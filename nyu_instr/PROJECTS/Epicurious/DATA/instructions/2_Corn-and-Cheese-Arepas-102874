Finely grind cornmeal in blender, 1/4 cup at a time. Transfer to large bowl. Mix in cheese, 2 tablespoons butter and salt. Add enough boiling water to mixture to make very thick batter. Stir in corn.
Heat griddle or large skillet over medium heat with some of remaining melted butter. Working in batches and using 1 tablespoon batter for each corn cake, drop batter onto skillet and cook until golden brown and cooked through, about 3 minutes per side. Serve hot.

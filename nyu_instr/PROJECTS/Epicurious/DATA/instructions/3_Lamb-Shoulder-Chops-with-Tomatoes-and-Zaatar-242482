Place tomatoes with puree in large saucepan. Add za'atar, 2 tablespoons oil, and garlic. Bring to boil over medium-high heat, stirring often. Stir until sauce thickens, crushing tomatoes, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
Meanwhile, sprinkle lamb with salt and pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add lamb and sauté until browned and cooked to desired doneness, about 5 minutes per side for medium-rare.
Spoon warm sauce over lamb; serve.

Whisk eggs, cream, flour, sugar, vanilla, and salt in a medium bowl until blended.
Heat 1/2 tablespoons butter in an 8" nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1/3 cup batter and cook until bottom is golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip omelet, remove skillet from heat, and add 1 tablespoon Calvados. Return skillet to heat and cook until Calvados thickens slightly, about 20 seconds.
Slide omelet onto a plate; fold into thirds. Spread 1 teaspoon room-temperature butter over; dust with powdered sugar. Repeat to make 3 more omelets.

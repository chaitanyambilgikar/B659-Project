Sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl and set aside. In a separate bowl, cream the butter and sugar until well blended. Add the egg and vanilla, then beat until light and fluffy. Add the flour mixture a half cup at a time, mixing well after each addition. Add the walnuts and mix to incorporate. Place the dough on a clean board and roll into a log approximately 2 1/2 inches in diameter. Wrap the dough log in waxed paper, fold ends under or tie with kitchen string to seal, and chill for at least 2 hours and up to 5 days.
When you are ready to bake the cookies, preheat oven to 350°F. Unwrap dough and slice crosswise into thin rounds approximately 1/4 inch thick. Bake on a cookie sheet lightly coated with nonstick spray for approximately 8 minutes.
To make favors: Place the shredded paper in the bottom of the box. Place the cookie on top of the paper and cover with the lid. Tie the ribbon around the box like a package and finish off with a knot.

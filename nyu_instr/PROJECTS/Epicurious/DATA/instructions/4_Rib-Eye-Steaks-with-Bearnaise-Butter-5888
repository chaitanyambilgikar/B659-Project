Boil wine, shallot and dried tarragon in small saucepan until liquid evaporates, about 2 minutes. Cool completely.
Mix butter and fresh tarragon into shallot mixture. Season with salt and pepper. Form butter mixture into log; wrap in plastic and chill until firm. (Can be made 3 days ahead. Keep chilled.) Cut butter into 1/3-inch-thick slices. Bring to room temperature before continuing.
Brush large nonstick skillet with oil; heat over medium-high heat. Sprinkle steaks with salt and pepper; add to skillet. Cook to desired doneness, about 5 minutes per side for medium-rare. Overlap butter slices atop steaks and serve.

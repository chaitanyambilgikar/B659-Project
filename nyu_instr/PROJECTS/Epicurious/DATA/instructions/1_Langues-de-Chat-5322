Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter 2 large baking sheets. Using electric mixer, beat butter and sugar in medium bowl until well blended. Beat in lemon peel and vanilla. Add egg whites and beat 30 seconds. Add flour and salt; beat just until blended
Spoon batter into pastry bag fitted with 1/3-inch plain round tip. Pipe batter onto baking sheets in 2 1/2-inch-long strips, spacing 2 inches apart. Bake until edges are golden, about 10 minutes.

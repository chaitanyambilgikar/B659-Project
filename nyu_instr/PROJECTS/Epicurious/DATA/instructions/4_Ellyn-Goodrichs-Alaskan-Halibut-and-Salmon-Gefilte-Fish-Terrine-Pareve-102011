Preheat the oven to 325°F. Grease a 12-cup bundt pan with the margarine.
Cut the fish into large chunks, and place in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse about 20 times, do not puree, but grind fine. Place in the bowl of an electric mixer.
Heat the oil in a large frying pan, and sauté the onions over medium-low heat until soft and transparent. Let cool.
To the fish mixture, add the onions, eggs, 2 cups of cold water, matzoh meal, salt, white pepper, sugar and lemon juice. Beat in the electric mixer at medium speed, using a paddle attachment, for about 10 minutes. Add the dill, and grate in the carrots; mix well.
Pour the mixture into the greased bundt pan. Smooth the top with a spatula, and cover with foil. Place a large pan filled with water which is almost boiling and comes at least halfway up the sides of the bundt pan.
Bake in the oven for 1 hour, or until the center is solid. Cool for 5 minutes, or until mold is cool to the touch. Run a knife around the edges. Place a flat serving plate on top, and then flip over, inverting the mold onto the plate. If the mold does not come out easily, give the plate a shake. You should feel or hear it give.
Refrigerate for several hours or overnight. Slice as you would a torte, and serve as an appetizer. Garnish with the parsley and remaining dill, and serve with red horseradish.

In a large heavy saucepan cook the onion and the carrots in the oil, covered, over moderately low heat, stirring occasionally, until the onion is softened, add the curry, and cook the mixture, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the broth and 3 cups water, bring the liquid to a boil, and simmer the mixture for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the carrots are very tender. In a blender or food processor purée the soup in batches, let it cool completely, and chill it, covered, until it is cold. The soup may be made 1 day in advance and kept covered and chilled. Divide the soup among 4 bowls and sprinkle it with the chives.

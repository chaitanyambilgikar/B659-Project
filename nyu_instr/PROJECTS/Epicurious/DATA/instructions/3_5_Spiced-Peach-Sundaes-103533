Melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add brown sugar; stir to blend. Add vanilla, cardamom and nutmeg. Stir 1 minute. Add peaches; toss gently to coat. Cook until sugar mixture melts and peaches are tender but do not fall apart, tossing occasionally, about 5 minutes. (Can be made 8 hours ahead. Cover; chill. Rewarm over low heat before using.)
Place 2 scoops ice cream in each of 8 bowls. Spoon peach mixture over ice cream, dividing equally. Garnish with pecans and whipped cream.

Preheat oven to 425°F. Season roast generously with gray sea salt and pepper. Heat oil in an ovenproof skillet or a small roasting pan set over high heat. Add roast to skillet and brown on all sides, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer skillet to oven and roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into center of roast registers 120°F for medium-rare, 40-50 minutes. Tent with foil; let rest 15 minutes. Thinly slice roast. Arrange on a platter and sprinkle with additional gray sea salt. Serve with Spinach Gunge alongside.

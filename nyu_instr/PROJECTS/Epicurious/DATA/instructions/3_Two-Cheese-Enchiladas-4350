Preheat oven to 350°F. Mix ricotta, 2 1/2 cups Monterey Jack, 1/2 cup taco sauce, chilies, onions and 1/4 cup cilantro in large bowl. Season filling with salt and pepper.
Heat oil in medium skillet over medium heat. Using tongs, add tortillas 1 at a time to oil; fry just until softened, about 5 seconds per side. Transfer tortillas to paper towels and drain.
Spread 1 cup taco sauce over bottom of 13x9x2-inch glass baking dish. Spoon generous 1/4 cup filling into center of 1 tortilla. Fold bottom of tortilla over filling; roll up tortilla to enclose filling. Place seam side down in prepared dish. Repeat with remaining tortillas and filling. Top with 1/2 cup taco sauce and 1 cup Monterey Jack.
Bake enchiladas uncovered until heated through, about 30 minutes. Sprinkle with additional cilantro.

Combine plums, 1 cup sugar, and cinnamon sticks in large saucepan. Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add bean. Stir over low heat until plums are very tender and compote thickens, stirring often and adding 1/3 cup sugar if desired, about 45 minutes. Remove from heat. Cool completely. Transfer compote to bowl, discarding pits, vanilla bean, and cinnamon sticks. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 days ahead. Cover; chill.

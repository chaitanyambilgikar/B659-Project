Preheat oven to 450°F.
Sift together flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt into a bowl, then blend in shortening with a pastry blender or your fingertips until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add 1 3/4 cups buttermilk and stir, adding up to 1/4 cup more, a little at a time, if needed, to form a soft but not sticky dough. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead gently 10 times.
Pat out dough on floured surface into a 14- by 10-inch rectangle. With a short side nearest you, spread top two thirds of dough evenly with 3 tablespoons softened butter, leaving bottom (the third closest to you) unbuttered. Fold dough into thirds, like a letter (unbuttered bottom third up, then top buttered third down over dough).
Turn dough 90 degrees (so a short side is nearest you) and pat into a rectangle about 12 by 9 inches. Spread top two thirds of dough evenly with 3 more tablespoons softened butter and fold like a letter again.
Turn dough 90 degrees (so a short side is nearest you) and pat into a rectangle 12 by 9 inches. Spread top two thirds of dough evenly with remaining 3 tablespoons softened butter and fold dough like a letter once more.
Pat out dough 3/4 inch thick and cut out biscuits with floured cutter, then arrange 1 inch apart on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Gather scraps and pat out once more, then cut out rounds and transfer to baking sheet. Lightly brush tops of biscuits with melted butter and bake in middle of oven until golden and cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes.

Heat olive oil in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onion, red bell pepper, garlic and chili. Sauté until vegetables soften, about 10 minutes. Add chili powder, cumin and oregano and sauté 2 minutes. Add Port and simmer until liquid reduces by half, about 10 minutes. Mix in beans and hominy and heat through. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Rewarm mixture over medium heat before continuing.) Add spinach and stir until wilted, about 2 minutes.
Spoon 1/3 cup vegetable mixture onto each tortilla. Roll up tortilla to enclose filling and serve.

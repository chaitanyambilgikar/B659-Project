Sift confectioners' sugar into bowl of a standing electric mixer or a large bowl. In a small bowl stir together water, corn syrup, lemon juice, and extract and add to sugar. With a standing or hand-held electric mixer beat together sugar mixture until combined.
On a work surface knead mixture into a ball (mixture will be very stiff). With a rolling pin, applying pressure, roll out mixture between sheets of wax paper into a 9-inch round (about 1/4 inch thick). Remove top sheet of wax paper from round and replace it loosely. Flip over wax paper-enclosed round and remove and discard sheet of wax paper now on top (this process prevents round from sticking to wax paper). Let round stand at room temperature until edges are firm, about 4 hours. Round may be made 1 week ahead and chilled on a tray, both tray and round wrapped together in plastic wrap. Bring round to room temperature before proceeding with recipe.
Oil a large baking sheet and line with wax paper. With a 1 1/4-inch cutter cut out patties from round, transferring them as cut to baking sheet.
Temper chocolate . (Alternatively, chop chocolate and, in a double boiler or a small metal bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water, melt chocolate, stirring until smooth.)
Balance 1 patty on a fork (do not spear) and submerge in chocolate (if necessary, spoon chocolate over patty to evenly coat). Holding patty on fork over chocolate, shake off any excess chocolate from patty and return patty to baking sheet. Submerge and coat remaining patties in same manner. Chill peppermint patties on baking sheet, uncovered, until firm, about 1 hour. Peppermint patties keep, layered between sheets of wax paper in an airtight container and chilled, 1 month.

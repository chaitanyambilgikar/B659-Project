In a large skillet cook the bell peppers, the onion, and the garlic in the butter over moderately low heat, stirring, until the vegetables are softened. Stir in the crab meat, the lemon juice, the egg, the Worcestershire sauce, the mayonnaise, the mustard, and the cayenne and divide the crab-meat mixture among the muffin halves, mounding it slightly. Sprinkle the sandwiches with Parmesan and broil them under a preheated broiler about 4 inches from the heat for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the tops are golden.

Tuck 1 narrow end of salmon in toward center. Wrap second narrow end around first to form solid round. Repeat with remaining salmon steaks, forming 4 solid rounds. Season with salt and pepper.
Preheat oven to 400°F. Cut four 3/4-to 1-inch-wide strips from center section of each tortilla. Wrap 2 strips around each salmon round, overlapping ends to encircle completely. Secure with toothpicks. Transfer to baking sheet. Sprinkle tops of salmon with 2 tablespoons chives, 2 tablespoons dill and 2 tablespoons onion. Press to adhere.
Melt 3 tablespoons butter in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat. Add 1/2 cup onion; sauté until tender but not brown, about 5 minutes. Add wine and lemon juice. Increase heat; boil until sauce is reduced to 1/3 cup, stirring occasionally, about 9 minutes. Set aside.
Bake salmon packets until salmon is cooked through, about 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, bring sauce to simmer over low heat. Add 6 tablespoons chilled butter 1 piece at a time, whisking just until melted after each addition. Remove from heat. Mix in 1 tablespoon chives and 1 tablespoon dill. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Transfer salmon to plates. Spoon sauce around and serve.

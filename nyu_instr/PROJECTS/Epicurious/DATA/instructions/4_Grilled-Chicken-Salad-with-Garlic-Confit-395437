Set a fine-mesh strainer over a medium bowl. Bring garlic and oil just to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Reduce heat to low; cook, stirring occasionally, until garlic is golden brown and soft, 20-25 minutes. Let cool completely. Strain, reserving cloves and oil.
Build a medium-hot fire in a charcoal grill, or heat a gas grill to high. Toss chicken and 2 tablespoons garlic oil in a medium bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Grill until charred and just cooked through, 4-5 minutes per side. Transfer to a board; let rest for 5 minutes.
Purée 8 garlic cloves, 1/2 cup garlic oil, Dijon mustard, and vinegar in a blender or mini-processor. Season dressing with salt and pepper. Place remaining garlic cloves, olives, and remaining ingredients in a large bowl (cover and chill remaining oil for another use). Slice chicken on a diagonal; add to bowl. Spoon 2 tablespoons dressing over; toss. Serve with remaining dressing.

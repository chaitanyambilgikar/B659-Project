Blend first 3 ingredients in processor. Add butter. Using on/off turns, process just until coarse meal forms. Whisk egg yolk and 1 1/2 tablespoons ice water in small bowl to blend. Drizzle egg mixture over dough. Using on/off turns, process until moist clumps begin to form, adding more water by teaspoonfuls if dough is dry. Gather dough into ball. Flatten into disk. Wrap in plastic; refrigerate 1 hour. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Keep chilled. Let dough soften slightly before rolling out.)

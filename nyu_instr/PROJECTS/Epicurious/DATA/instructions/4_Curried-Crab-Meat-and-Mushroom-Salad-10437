In a bowl whisk together the mayonnaise, the curry powder, the minced tarragon, and 1 to 2 tablespoons water, or enough to thin the sauce to the desired consistency. Stir in the crab meat, the mushrooms, and the lemon juice and on salad plates mound the mixture on the celery, drained. Garnish the salads with the tarragon sprigs.

Purée fish with yogurt in a food processor until smooth.
Stir together ginger, garlic, chile, salt, cumin, coriander, and turmeric in a large bowl, then add fish and cilantro and stir until seasonings are evenly distributed.
Spread bread crumbs on a plate. Wet hands slightly, then form 2 tablespoons fish mixture into an oval about 3 inches long. Flatten oval slightly, then transfer to crumbs and turn to coat lightly. Transfer to a tray lined with wax paper. Make about 17 more patties in same manner.
Heat 1/2 inch oil in a 10-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then fry patties in 2 batches, gently turning over once or twice with tongs, until golden and just cooked through, 2 1/2 to 3 minutes per batch. Transfer as fried to paper towels to drain.
If serving as an hors d'oeuvre, put each patty on a skewer and serve with chutney for dipping. If serving as a first course, divide patties among 6 plates (about 3 per person) and drizzle with chutney.

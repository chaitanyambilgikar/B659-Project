Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 450°F.
Rub chicken with oil in a shallow baking pan (1 inch deep) and sprinkle with pepper and 1 teaspoon salt. Roast chicken until just cooked through, 40 to 45 minutes.
While chicken roasts, blend tahini, water, lemon juice, garlic, sugar, and remaining teaspoon salt in a blender until smooth.
Blanch sugar snaps in a 2-quart saucepan of 1 minute, then drain in a colander. Rinse under cold running water to stop cooking and drain well.
When chicken is cool enough to handle, remove skin and discard. Remove meat from bones in large pieces, discarding bones, then pull meat into 1/3-inch-wide strips and transfer to a large bowl. Add sugar snaps, bell pepper, and dressing and toss to coat. Sprinkle with sesame seeds.

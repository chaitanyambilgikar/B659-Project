Line 9 x 5-inch loaf pan with foil, overlapping sides. Place first 4 ingredients in metal bowl. Mix sugar, milk, water, cream and butter in heavy 3-quart saucepan. Stir over medium-low heat until sugar dissolves. Brush down sugar crystals from sides of pan using pastry brush dipped into water. Increase heat to high; bring to rolling boil. Reduce heat to medium-high; stir slowly with wooden spoon until clip-on candy thermometer registers 232°F, about 9 minutes. Pour boiling mixture over ingredients in bowl; do not scrape pan. Stir vigorously with wooden spoon until chocolate melts and fudge thickens slightly, about 2 minutes (mixture should still be very soft and glossy). Immediately pour fudge into prepared pan; smooth top with rubber spatula. Refrigerate fudge until firm enough to cut, about 2 hours. Lift fudge from pan, using foil as aid. Fold down foil sides. Trim ends of fudge. Cut into 24 pieces. Press candied violet into center of each, if desired. (Can be made 1 week ahead. Chill in airtight container. Serve at room temperature.)

Sprinkle short ribs with 3 teaspoons salt and 2 teaspoons pepper.
In large heavy stockpot over high heat, heat oil until hot but not smoking. Working in batches, sear ribs, turning occasionally, until brown on all sides, about 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer as browned to plate, reserving rendered fat in pan. Add onions, carrots, celery, fennel, lemongrass, garlic, and ginger and sauté, stirring frequently, until soft, about 10 minutes. Add rice wine, soy sauce, thyme, and bay leaves, and remaining 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Return short ribs to pot and add water to cover. Bring to boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 3 1/2 hours, then brush with glaze. Continue cooking, brushing with glaze every 5 minutes, until meat is very tender and falling off bones, about 4 hours total. Transfer ribs to serving dish, brush with glaze, and serve.

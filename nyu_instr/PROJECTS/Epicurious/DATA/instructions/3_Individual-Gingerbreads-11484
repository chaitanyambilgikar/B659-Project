Grease two 4 1/2-inch tart pans (3/4 inch deep, without removable bottoms) and dust them with flour, knocking out excess. In a small bowl whisk together the flour, the ginger, the cinnamon, the baking powder, the nutmeg, and the allspice until the mixture is combined well. In another small bowl whisk together the molasses, the sour cream, the oil, and the vanilla until the mixture is smooth. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture, pour in the molasses mixture, and whisk the batter until it is just combined.
Divide the batter between the prepared pans, bake the gingerbreads in the middle of a preheated 350°F. oven for 13-15 minutes, or until a tester inserted in the center comes out clean, and let them cool in the pans on a rack. Turn the gingerbreads out and serve them with the whipped cream.

In a skillet cook the bacon over moderate heat, stirring, for 5 minutes, or until it is crisp, transfer it to paper towels to drain, and in the fat remaining in the skillet cook the potatoes, peeled, sliced thin, and patted dry, and the onion, covered, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes, or until the potatoes are browned. Reduce the heat to moderately low, stir in the garlic, and cook the mixture, uncovered, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes. Stir in the bacon, the scallions, the parsley, and salt and pepper to taste and cook the mixture, covered, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender.

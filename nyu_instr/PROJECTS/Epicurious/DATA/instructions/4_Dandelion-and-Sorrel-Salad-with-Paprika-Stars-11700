Make the stars: Cut out as many stars as possible from the bread with a small star-shaped cutter, in a skillet cook them in the oil over moderately low heat, turning them, until they are golden, and in a small bowl toss them with paprika and salt and pepper to taste.
Make the dressing: In a large bowl whisk together the vinegar, the water, the sugar, and salt and pepper to taste, add the oil in a stream, whisking, and whisk the dressing until it is emulsified.
Add the dandelion greens, the sorrel leaves, and the stars to the bowl and toss the salad well.

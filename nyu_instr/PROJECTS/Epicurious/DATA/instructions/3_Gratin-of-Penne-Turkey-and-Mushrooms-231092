Position rack in top third of oven; preheat to 350°F. Butter 13x9x2-inch glass or ceramic baking dish. Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite. Drain.
Melt 2 tablespoons butter in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add shallots; sauté 1 minute. Add mushrooms and thyme; sauté until mushrooms are tender and dark brown, about 12 minutes. Add pasta, gravy, 1 cup cheese, and cream to mushroom mixture; stir to blend. Mix in turkey. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer to prepared baking dish. Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup cheese. Bake gratin until sauce is bubbling around edges and tips of pasta are golden brown, about 25 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes and serve.

Preheat oven to 300°F. and butter a large baking sheet.
Coarsely chop cashews. Into a bowl sift together flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt. In another bowl with an electric mixer beat together 3 eggs, zest, and vanilla until just combined. Stir in flour mixture and beat until a stiff dough is formed. Stir in cashews.
In a small bowl beat together water and remaining egg to make an egg wash. On baking sheet with floured hands form dough into two 12-inch-long logs and flatten slightly. Brush logs with some egg wash. Bake logs in middle of oven until golden, about 50 minutes. Cool logs on baking sheet on a rack 10 minutes.
On a cutting board with a serrated knife diagonally cut logs into roughly 1/3-inch-thick slices. Arrange biscotti, a cut side down, on baking sheet and bake in middle of oven until crisp, about 15 minutes. Cool biscotti on rack. Biscotti keep in an airtight container at cool room temperature 2 weeks.

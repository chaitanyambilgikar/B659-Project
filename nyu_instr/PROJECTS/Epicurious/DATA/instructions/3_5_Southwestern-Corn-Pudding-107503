Butter 13x9x2-inch glass baking dish. Cut corn bread into 1-inch cubes; place in large bowl.
Stir corn kernels in large dry skillet over medium-high heat until any excess moisture evaporates, about 3 minutes. Transfer to bowl with corn bread. Add cheese, bell pepper, chili, and green onions. Whisk buttermilk, enchilada sauce, eggs, and salt in medium bowl to blend. Add to corn bread mixture and toss gently to combine. Transfer mixture to prepared dish. Cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour and up to 1 day.
Preheat oven to 350°F. Bake corn pudding uncovered until slightly crisp and golden on top, about 1 hour. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.
* Also known as a California chili; available at Latin American markets and many supermarkets.

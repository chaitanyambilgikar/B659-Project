Trim the broccoli, peel the stems, and slice them thin. Cut the flowerets into 2-inch pieces and reserve them. In a large steamer set over boiling water steam the broccoli stems, covered, for 5 minutes, or until they are crisp-tender, and transfer them to a bowl. In the steamer steam the reserved flowerets, covered, for 3 to 5 minutes, or until they are crisp-tender, and transfer them to another bowl. Sprinkle the stems and the flowerets with the zest, the red pepper flakes, and salt to taste, drizzle the oil over them, and toss the mixtures well. Arrange the stems in the center of a platter and arrange the flowerets around them.

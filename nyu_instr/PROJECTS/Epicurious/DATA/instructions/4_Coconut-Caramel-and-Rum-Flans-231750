Preheat oven to 350°F. Arrange six 3/4-cup custard cups or ramekins in 13x9x2-inch metal baking pan. Combine first 8 ingredients in medium bowl; whisk to blend. Pour custard into cups, dividing equally. Pour enough hot water into baking pan to come halfway up sidesof custard cups.
Bake flans until set in center and golden brown on top, about 38 minutes. Remove flans from water. Chill uncovered until cold, about 3 hours. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and keep chilled.)
Sprinkle flans with toasted coconut.

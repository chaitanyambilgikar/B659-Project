Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter and flour 13x9x2-inch metal baking pan. Place sugar, cocoa, and salt in large bowl. Pour in oil (do not mix). Place baking soda in medium bowl; stir in 1 1/2 cups hot water (mixture will bubble up). Add baking soda mixture to cocoa mixture and, using electric mixer, beat until cool, about 1 minute. Beat in flour, then eggs and vanilla. Transfer batter to prepared pan.
Bake cake until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Cool cake completely in pan on rack. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and store at room temperature.) Cut cake into squares and serve.

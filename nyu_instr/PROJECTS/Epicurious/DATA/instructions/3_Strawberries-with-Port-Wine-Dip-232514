Bring Port and sugar to a boil in a 2- to 3-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat, stirring until sugar is dissolved, and boil, uncovered, until slightly syrupy and reduced to 1 to 1 1/4 cups, about 20 minutes. Cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes (sauce will thicken as it cools). Transfer to a small bowl and serve with berries for dipping.

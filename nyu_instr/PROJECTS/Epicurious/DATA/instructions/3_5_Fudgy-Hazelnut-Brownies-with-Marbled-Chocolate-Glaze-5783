Make brownie: Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter and flour 15 x 10 x 1-inch jelly-roll pan. Stir chocolate and butter in heavy medium saucepan over medium-low heat until melted and smooth. Remove from heat. Combine sugar, eggs and salt in heavy large saucepan. Whisk constantly over low heat just until sugar dissolves, about 5 minutes (do not boil). Remove from heat. Whisk in chocolate mixture and vanilla. Whisk in flour and nuts. Spread batter in pan. Bake until tester inserted into center comes out with some moist crumbs still attached, about 30 minutes. Cool brownies completely in pan on rack.
Make topping: Stir semisweet chocolate in top of double boiler over barely simmering water until smooth. Remove from over water. Spread over brownie.
Stir white chocolate in top of double boiler over barely simmering water until smooth. Spoon into resealable plastic bag. Cut very tip off 1 corner of bag. Pipe lines of white chocolate crosswise atop brownie, spacing lines 1 inch apart. Draw a toothpick lengthwise across lines, alternating direction from left to right and right to left, to create marbled pattern. Chill just until firm enough to cut, about 30 minutes. Cut into small squares. (Can be made 3 days ahead. Refrigerate in single layer in airtight containers. Bring to room temperature before serving.)

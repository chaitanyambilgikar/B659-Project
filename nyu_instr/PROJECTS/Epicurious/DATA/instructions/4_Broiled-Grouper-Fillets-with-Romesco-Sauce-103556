Make sauce: Finely grind almonds, bread, garlic, and red pepper flakes in a food processor. Add roasted peppers, vinegar, and salt, then purée, adding oil in a slow stream. Season with black pepper.
Make fish: Preheat broiler.
Put fish on a lightly oiled shallow (1-inch-deep) baking pan, skin sides down. Brush fish with oil and season with salt and pepper. Broil 3 inches from heat, without turning, until just cooked through, about 7 minutes.

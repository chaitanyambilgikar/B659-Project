1. Prepare the salsa. Gently fold together all the salsa ingredients in a bowl. Refrigerate, covered, until ready to use, up to 4 hours.
2. Sprinkle 2 tortillas evenly with half of the cheese. Scatter the chicken, mushrooms, scallions, and basil equally over the cheese. Dot both with sour cream. Sprinkle with the remaining cheese.
3. Place a second tortilla over each, creating a sandwich, or quesadilla.
4. Heat a nonstick dry skillet over medium heat. Place a quesadilla in the skillet and cook, turning once, until tortilla browns slightly, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove to a low oven to keep warm. Repeat.
5. Cut each quesadilla into quarters. Top with salsa.

Cook carrots in small saucepan of boiling salted water until tender, about 8 minutes. Drain well.
Meanwhile, sprinkle beef with salt and pepper. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add beef and sauté until brown on all sides but still pink in center, about 2 minutes. Transfer beef to plate. Melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter in same skillet over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms and shallots. Sauté until vegetables soften, about 5 minutes. Mix in 1 1/2 tablespoons thyme. Add wine and broth to skillet. Increase heat and boil until sauce is reduced to 1/2 cup, scraping up browned bits, about 8 minutes. Return beef and any juices to skillet. Add carrots. Cook until flavors blend, about 1 minute. Season stew to taste with salt and pepper. Divide stew between plates. Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 tablespoon thyme.

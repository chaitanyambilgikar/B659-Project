Soak cod in a large bowl with water to cover by 2 inches, chilled, changing water 3 times a day, 1 to 3 days (see cooks' note, below). Chill cod until ready to use.
Heat vegetable oil in a 5- to 6-quart heavy pot over moderate heat until it registers 385 to 390°F on thermometer.
While oil is heating, whisk together flour, salt, olive oil, water, and parsley in a bowl. Drain cod and pat dry, then cut into 3- by 1/2-inch strips. Working in batches of 4, coat strips in batter, then transfer to oil with tongs and fry, turning, until golden, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a paper-towel-lined baking sheet to drain. (Return oil to 385 to 390°F between batches.)
Sprinkle with sea salt and serve immediately.

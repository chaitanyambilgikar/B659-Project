Combine stock and barley in large pot. Bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer until barley is tender, stirring occasionally, about 1 hour.
Heat oil in heavy large skillet over high heat. Add onions; sauté 5 minutes. Add fresh mushrooms; sauté until brown, about 5 minutes. Mix in garlic. Add sautéed mushroom mixture, dried mushrooms, celery, carrot and parsnip to soup. Simmer until dried mushrooms and parsnip are tender, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cool slightly. Chill uncovered until cold, then cover and chill. Bring to simmer before serving.)

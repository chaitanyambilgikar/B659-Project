1. Make the paste: Combine the oil and garlic in a small, heavy-bottomed saucepan. Place over low heat and cook until the garlic just barely begins to brown around the edges, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the ground coriander and cumin, and cook 1 minute, stirring constantly. Stir in the chili powder and black pepper and cook, stirring, 2 minutes longer. Add the sage and verjus, bring to a simmer, and cook until reduced and thickened to a paste, 1 to 2 more minutes. Remove from the heat, transfer to a bowl, and cool completely before using.
2. Use your fingers to coat the salmon with the cooled chili paste. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours.
3. Wipe the paste from the salmon.
4. Heat the oil over medium heat in a skillet large enough to hold all the salmon fillets. Sprinkle the salmon fillets with salt, place them in the pan, and cook gently until well browned and just cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer the salmon to warm plates and serve immediately.
Wine Suggestions: Champagne or any good sparkling wine would be ideal here. The bubbles and acidity will put out the chili paste fire and cut right through the richness of the salmon. You’d also do well with a young, fruity rosé.

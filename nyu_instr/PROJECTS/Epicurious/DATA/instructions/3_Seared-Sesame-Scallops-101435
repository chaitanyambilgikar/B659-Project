In a small bowl stir together sesame seeds, salt, and pepper. Remove tough muscle from side of each scallop if necessary and pat scallops dry. Dip flat sides of each scallop in sesame mixture. In a 12-inch nonstick skillet heat oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and sauté scallops on flat sides until sesame seeds are golden and scallops are just cooked through, about 4 minutes total.
Serve scallops with couscous and lemon wedges.

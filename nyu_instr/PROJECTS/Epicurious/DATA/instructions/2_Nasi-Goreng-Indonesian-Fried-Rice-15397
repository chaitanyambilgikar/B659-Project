Place the drained rice and cold water in a large pan. Bring to a boil, uncovered, then simmer for 10-12 minutes, until all the water is absorbed.
Stir once with a wooden spoon, then reduce the heat to low. Cover the pan and let cook undisturbed for 10-12 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and set it, still covered, on a wet dish towel. Let stand for 5 minutes.
Spoon the rice into a bowl, cover with a damp dish towel, and let stand for 2-3 hours, or until cold.
Heat the oil in a wok. Add the shallots or onion, the fresh chilies or chili powder, and the ginger and stir-fry for 1-2 minutes. Add the carrots and cabbage and stir-fry 2 minutes longer.
Add all the remaining ingredients, except the rice and garnishes, and stir-fry for 6 minutes, or until all the vegeables are cooked through.
Add the cold rice and mix it thoroughly with the vegetables over low heat, until it is heated through and takes on the reddish tinge of the paprika and tomato paste. Do not allow the rice to burn. Transfer the mixture to a heated serving dish and arrange the garnishes on top and around the dish.

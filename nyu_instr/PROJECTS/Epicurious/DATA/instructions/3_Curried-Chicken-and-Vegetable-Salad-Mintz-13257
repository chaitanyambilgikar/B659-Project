In a 4-quart saucepan bring 3 quarts salted water to a boil for vegetables. Cut potatoes into 1/4-inch-thick slices and boil until just tender, about 3 minutes. Transfer potatoes with a small strainer or slotted spoon to a bowl of ice and cold water to stop cooking. Cool potatoes and transfer with strainer or slotted spoon to a large serving bowl. Boil and cool carrots and green beans separately in same manner and add to potatoes.
In a large skillet cook onion and curry powder in oil over moderately high heat, stirring, until onion is softened and add tomatoes. Cook mixture, stirring occasionally, 1 minute and add to vegetables. Cool mixture.
In a small bowl whisk together mayonnaise and yogurt and stir into cool vegetable mixture with chicken, pork or ham, and salt and pepper to taste. Salad may be made 4 hours ahead and chilled, covered.

Using a sharp knife, cut away peel and white pith from oranges and grapefruit. Remove orange and grapefruit segments from their membranes. Squeeze juice from membranes into a small bowl. Whisk honey into juice. Arrange layers of orange segments, grapefruit segments and starfruit slices in a clear glass serving dish. Top with grapes. Pour sweetened juice over fruit and garnish with zest. Chill at least 1 hour before serving.

Heat oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add sausages; sauté until browned, breaking up with back of fork, about 5 minutes. Add peppers and onion; sauté until soft and onion is golden brown, about 13 minutes. Stir in marjoram, then tomatoes. Simmer until tomatoes soften and release their juices, crushing with back of fork, about 5 minutes. Season generously to taste with salt and pepper.
Meanwhile, cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite. Drain.
Return pasta to pot. Add sausage mixture and goat cheese; stir to blend. Transfer pasta to plates and serve.

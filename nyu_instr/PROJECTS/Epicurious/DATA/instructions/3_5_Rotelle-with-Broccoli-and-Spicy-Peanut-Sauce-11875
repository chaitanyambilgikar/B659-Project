In a large bowl whisk together the peanut butter, the water, the soy sauce, the Worcestershire sauce, the garlic, the sugar, the cayenne, and salt to taste until the sauce is smooth. In a saucepan of boiling salted water boil the pasta until it is barely al dente, add the broccoli and the bell pepper, and boil the mixture for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the vegetables are al dente. Drain the mixture well, add it to the peanut sauce, and toss the mixture well.

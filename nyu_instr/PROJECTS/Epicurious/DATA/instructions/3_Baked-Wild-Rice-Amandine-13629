Preheat oven to 475°F.
In a 10-inch round baking dish toast almonds in oven until golden, about 5 minutes. Add butter and rice and toss to coat. Stir in broth and salt and cover dish with foil. Bake rice in lower third of oven 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until rice is tender. If all of broth has not been absorbed, bake rice, uncovered, 5 minutes more.
Rice may be made 1 day ahead and reheated before serving.

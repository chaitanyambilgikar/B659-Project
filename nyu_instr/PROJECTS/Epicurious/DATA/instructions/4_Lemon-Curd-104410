Whisk together lemon juice, lemon zest, sugar, and eggs in a 2-quart saucepan.
Cut butter into bits and add to mixture.
Cook mixture, stirring constantly, over moderately low heat until curd is thick enough to hold marks of whisk and first bubble appears on surface, about 6 minutes. (You can make the curd 1 week ahead and chill it, covering its surface with plastic wrap.)

In large pot, combine chicken parts and enough water to cover by two inches. Cover, set over high heat, and bring to boil. Lower heat and simmer 20 minutes. Using tongs, transfer chicken to cutting board. When cool enough to handle, remove skin and bones and cut meat into small pieces. Refrigerate until ready to use.
In medium bowl, whisk together yogurt and flour. Whisk in milk. Strain through sieve lined with cheesecloth into large bowl. Cover and set aside at room temperature 1 hour.
In medium skillet over moderately low heat, heat oil. Add onion and sauté until golden yellow, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside, reserving cooking oil as well as onions.
In large saucepan over high heat, bring stock to boil. Add garlic, salt, and pepper, and boil, uncovered, 5 minutes. Lower heat to moderately low and stir in yogurt mixture. Simmer, whisking constantly, until sauce thickens, about 5 minutes. Stir in chicken and 1 tablespoon onions and simmer until just heated through, about 5 minutes.
To serve, pour into deep serving dish and sprinkle with remaining onions and cooking oil.

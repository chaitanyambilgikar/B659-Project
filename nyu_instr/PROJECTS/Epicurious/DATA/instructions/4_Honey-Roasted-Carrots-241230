1. Preheat the oven to 450°:F.
2. Cut the carrots into thirds, crosswise on a sharp diagonal.
3. Bring salted water to a boil in a large pot fitted with a steamer basket. Let carrots steam until just tender, about 5 minutes. Drain and place in a bowl. Toss with the oil, honey, salt and pepper.
4. Place the carrots on a baking sheet in a single layer and bake for 25 minutes. Loosen them from the baking sheet with a spatula. Adjust the seasonings and remove to a serving bowl.

1 To make the onions, melt the butter in a nonstick large skillet over medium heat. Add the onions and salt and stir well. Add 1 cup water. Cook, stirring often, until the water evaporates and the onions are softened, about 20 minutes. Stir another cup of water into the onions. Cook, stirring often, until the water evaporates and the onions are tender and beginning to brown, about 20 minutes more.
2 Stir in the vinegar and honey. Cook, stirring often to avoid scorching, until the onions are caramelized and the liquids are syrupy, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and cover the skillet to keep the onions warm.
3 Meanwhile, prepare a hot fire in an outdoor grill. Season the steaks with the salt and pepper and let stand at room temperature while the grill heats.
4 Lightly oil the grill grate. Place the steaks on the grill and cover. Grill, turning after 3 1/2 minutes, until the tops of the steaks feel somewhat firmer than raw when pressed with a finger, about 7 minutes for medium-rare steak.
5 Transfer each steak to a dinner plate. Top with a heap of onions and serve at once.

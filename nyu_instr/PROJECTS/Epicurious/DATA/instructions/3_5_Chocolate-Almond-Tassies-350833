For dough: Beat butter, cream cheese, sugar, and salt in large bowl until blended. Stir in flour (dough will be soft and sticky). Scrape dough onto sheet of plastic wrap. Using plastic as aid, shape dough into disk. Cover and chill until firm, at least 2 hours.
Roll dough into twenty-four 1-inch balls; place 1 dough ball in each of 24 mini (2 x3/4-inch) muffin cups. Chill 15 to 20 minutes. Using floured fingertips, press dough over bottom and up sides of each muffin cup, forming shell. Chill until ready to use, up to 1 day.
For filling: Preheat oven to 350°F. Whisk first 5 ingredients in medium bowl until blended. Stir in almonds and chocolate morsels. Spoon filling into shells.
Bake tassies until crusts are golden brown and filling is set, 23 to 25 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes. Using small sharp knife, cut around each cookie to loosen, then turn out onto rack and cool completely. DO AHEAD: Can be made 3 days ahead. Store airtight in refrigerator.

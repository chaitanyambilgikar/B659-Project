Coarsely mash strawberries, raspberries, and sugar in a bowl with a potato masher. Let berries stand, loosely covered, at room temperature, stirring occasionally, 1 hour.
Drain berry mixture in a fine sieve set over a bowl, pressing lightly on berries. Reserve crushed berries for another use.
For each serving, spoon 2 1/2 tablespoons syrup over 3/4 cup lightly packed shaved ice. Serve immediately.

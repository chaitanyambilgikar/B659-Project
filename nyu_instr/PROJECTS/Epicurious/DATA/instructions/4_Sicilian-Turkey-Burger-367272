In a bowl, mix turkey, tomato paste, currants, capers, basil, fennel seeds and salt. Form turkey mixture into four 3/4-inch-thick patties. Coat a grill rack or grill pan with cooking spray. Grill patties over medium-high heat until underside is well browned, about 7 minutes; flip and cook 5 minutes more. Top each patty with 2 tablespoons Parmesan; close lid or cover pan. Cook until internal temperature reaches 165°F, about 2 minutes. Brush bottom of each roll with 1 teaspoon vinegar; top with 1 burger, tomato, if desired, and other half of roll.

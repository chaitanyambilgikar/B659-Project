Make the toasts: Bake the bread slices on a baking sheet in one layer in the middle of a preheated 350°F. oven for 10 to 15 minutes, or until they are golden. The toasts may be baked 1 day in advance and kept in an airtight container. They may also be baked at the same time as the croutons for the pea soup. In a bowl cream the Roquefort with the butter and spread the mixture on the toasts.
Make the salad: In a large bowl whisk the vinegar with the mustard and salt and pepper to taste, add the oil in a stream, whisking, and whisk the dressing until it is emulsified. Add the frisée and the arugula and toss the mixture well to coat the greens with the dressing. Season the salad with pepper, divide it among 6 salad plates, and arrange 2 toasts on each plate.

Cut the bread into 1/2-inch squares. Put a deep pan over medium heat, then add the oil. When the oil is hot, fry in the cubes in batches for 6-8 minutes, until golden brown and crisp. Lift the croutons out of the oil with a slotted spoon. Transfer onto paper towels, and let drain. Serve warm or cold.

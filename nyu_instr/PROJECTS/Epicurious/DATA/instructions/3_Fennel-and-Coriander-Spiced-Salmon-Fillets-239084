Prepare barbecue (high heat). Coarsely grind fennel seeds and coriander seeds in spice grinder. Brush salmon fillets generously with oil. Sprinkle both sides of fillets with salt and pepper, then with spice mixture, pressing to adhere.
Grill salmon, covered, until center is just opaque, about 4 minutes per side.

Preheat oven to 400°F. Break up stuffing into bowl. Add 3/4 cup cheese, egg, parsley, basil, and green onions; mix well. If mixture seems dry, add 1 tablespoon olive oil to moisten. Season with salt and pepper.
Scoop out center of mushroom caps using small spoon. Fill each mushroom with stuffing; place on rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup cheese. Bake until stuffing is golden brown on top, about 15 minutes. Serve hot or at room temperature. (Can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand covered at room temperature.)

Cut turkey meat off bone with a paring knife, then cut (or pull off) and discard tendons and skin from meat. Cut turkey into 1-inch pieces.
Heat oil in a 6- to 7-quart wide heavy pot over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then cook onion, bell pepper, and celery, stirring frequently, until onion begins to brown, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring, 30 seconds. Add meat, tomatoes, broth, water, salt, and cayenne and bring to a boil, covered, over high heat. Stir in rice and bring to a full rolling boil. Cover pot, then cook over low heat until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, about 20 minutes. Let stand off heat, covered, 5 minutes. Stir in scallion greens.

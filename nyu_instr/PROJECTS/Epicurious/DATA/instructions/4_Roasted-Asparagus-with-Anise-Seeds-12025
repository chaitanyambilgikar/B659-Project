Preheat oven to 450°F.
In an electric coffee/spice grinder or with a mortar and pestle grind anise seeds fine.
Cut asparagus diagonally into 2-inch pieces and in a shallow baking pan large enough to hold asparagus in one layer toss with anise, oil, and salt and pepper to taste. Roast asparagus in middle of oven, shaking pan occasionally, until crisp-tender and golden, 5 to 8 minutes.

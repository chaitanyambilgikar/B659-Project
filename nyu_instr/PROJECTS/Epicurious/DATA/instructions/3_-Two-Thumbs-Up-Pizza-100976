Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium heat. Add onions and leeks and sautâ€© until tender, about 20 minutes. Add wine and vinegar. Cook until most of liquid evaporates and onions are brown, stirring frequently, about 20 minutes longer. Mix in prosciutto, basil and cayenne. Season to taste with salt and black pepper. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
Preheat oven to 450°F. Place pizza crusts on 2 large baking sheets. Spoon onion mixture evenly atop crusts, leaving 1-inch border around edges. Sprinkle cheese and rosemary over onions.
Bake pizzas until cheese melts and begins to brown and crusts are crisp and golden, about 12 minutes. Cool on baking sheets 5 minutes. Cut into slices and serve.

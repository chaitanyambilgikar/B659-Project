Peel potatoes and cut into 1-inch pieces. In a 4-quart saucepan boil potatoes, garlic, and water, skimming froth, until potatoes, are very tender, about 15 minutes.
Set broiler rack about 1 inch from heat and preheat broiler.
While potatoes are boiling, in a bowl sprinkle bread with oil and salt to taste and toss. On a baking sheet arrange bread in one layer as close together as possible and sprinkle with half of Parmesan. Broil bread until Parmesan is melted, about 1 minute.
Transfer potatoes with a slotted spoon to a bowl, reserving cooking liquid in pan, and with a potato masher mash coarse. Stir potatoes and broccoli into reserved cooking liquid and simmer, partially covered, stirring occasionally, until broccoli is tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in remaining Parmesan and salt and pepper to taste.
Serve soup with croutons.

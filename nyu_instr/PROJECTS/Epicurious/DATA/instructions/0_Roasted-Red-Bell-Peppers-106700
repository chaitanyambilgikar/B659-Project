Halve, core, and seed peppers. Flatten each half slightly with your hand. Line a baking sheet with foil, then lay peppers, skin-side up, in a single layer on the foil. Place under a preheated broiler, about 3 inches from heat source, until skins are charred. Remove to a paper or plastic bag, seal, and let peppers steam for about 15 minutes. Slip off and discard charred skins. Use as desired.

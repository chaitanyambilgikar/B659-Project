Make vinaigrette In a small bowl whisk together vinegar, mustard, pepper, and salt to taste. In a slow stream whisk in oil until emulsified.
Discard stems from arugula and transfer leaves to a large bowl. Trim tough stem ends from figs and cut each fig into 8 wedges. Trim some of fat from prosciutto if desired. Halve 6 prosciutto slices lengthwise. Overlap narrow ends of 2 halves by 1 to 2 inches, pressing together gently, to form 6 pieces about 13 inches long (use remaining 2 prosciutto slices if necessary). Transfer long prosciutto pieces as prepared to a tray lined with plastic wrap. With a vegetable peeler shave about 36 thin slices from Parmigiano-Reggiano.
Toss arugula with about 3 tablespoons vinaigrette and mound in center of each of 6 plates. Arrange long prosciutto pieces in a ring around each mound of arugula, overlapping ends to secure . Arrange figs and Parmigiano-Reggiano shavings on and around salad and drizzle salads with remaining vinaigrette.

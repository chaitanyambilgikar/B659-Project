Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter and flour 2 nonstick mini Bundt pans (6 cakes per pan). Sift flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt into large bowl. Whisk 13/4 cups hot water and chai tea powder in another large bowl to blend. Whisk honey, melted butter, buttermilk, eggs, and egg yolk into chai mixture to blend. Stir chai mixture into flour mixture until just blended. Divide batter among prepared Bundt pans (about 1/2 cup per pan).
Bake cakes until toothpick inserted near center comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Invert immediately onto rack. Cool 10 minutes. Serve warm with scoop of vanilla ice cream drizzled with Spiced Syrup. (Cakes can be made 1 day ahead. Rewarm briefly in microwave.)
*Can be found in the coffee and tea section of most supermarkets.

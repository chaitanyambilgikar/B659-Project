Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease a 9x13-inch cake pan.
In a bowl, soak the coconut in the hot water. In a separate bowl, cream the butter and sugar. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing until the egg is completely incorporated before adding the next one. Add half the mochiko and mix until completely incorporated. Add half the coconut and water and mix until completely incorporated. Add the remaining mochiko and mix until completely incorporated. Add the remaining coconut and water and mix until completely incorporated. Pour into the prepared pan.
Bake for approximately 45 minutes or until the edges are slightly brown. Cut into squares to serve. Or turn the cake out onto a cutting board and use a ring mold or cookie cutter to cut out shapes.

Make wasabi caper sauce: Stir together all sauce ingredients and chill, covered, until ready to use.
Make crab cakes: Wash leek well in a bowl of cold water, agitating leek, then lift out and drain.
Whisk together whole egg, yolk, mayonnaise, and mustard in a large bowl, then stir in bell pepper, leek, ginger, and 3/4 cup panko. Stir in crabmeat and chill, covered, 1 hour. Divide mixture into 8 mounds and form into 8 (1-inch-thick) patties. Spread remaining 3/4 cup panko in a shallow dish, then carefully coat patties, 1 at a time, in panko.
Heat 3/4 inch oil in a 10-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until it registers 350°F on thermometer. (Adjust heat as necessary; see cooks' note, below.) Fry crab cakes in 2 batches, turning over once, until golden brown, 4 to 6 minutes per batch. Transfer to several layers of paper towels to drain. Return oil to 350°F between batches. Serve crab cakes with sauce.

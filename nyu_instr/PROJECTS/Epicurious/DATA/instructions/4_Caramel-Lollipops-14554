Have ready a large bowl of ice and cold water. Lightly spray 10 lollipop molds with cooking spray and, if using skewers, cut off pointed ends with scissors. Put lollipop sticks or skewers in molds. Alternatively, if not using molds, lightly spray a sheet of parchment paper with cooking spray and have ready 10 lollipop sticks or skewers.
In a heavy saucepan bring 1 cup sugar, 1/2 cup water, 1/3 cup corn syrup, and 1/8 teaspoon flavored oil to a boil over moderate heat, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Boil syrup, without stirring, washing down sugar crystals clinging to side of pan with a brush dipped in cold water, until syrup is pale golden. Continue to cook syrup, without stirring, swirling pan occasionally, until golden.
Remove pan from heat and dip bottom of pan into ice water to stop caramel from cooking further (water will hiss and splatter). Spoon caramel into 10 molds. (If caramel in pan becomes too hard, heat over low heat, without stirring, until spoonable.) If using jellied candies, work quickly to decorate; if using chocolates, cool lollipops about 5 minutes before decorating. Alternatively, spoon caramel onto parchment to make 10 lollipops. Decorate lollipops in same manner and firmly press 1 end of a lollipop stick or skewer onto each. Cool lollipops completely, about 30 minutes, and remove from molds or parchment. Make 10 more lollipops in same manner. (Lollipops keep, layered between sheets of wax paper in an airtight container at cool room temperature, 2 weeks.)

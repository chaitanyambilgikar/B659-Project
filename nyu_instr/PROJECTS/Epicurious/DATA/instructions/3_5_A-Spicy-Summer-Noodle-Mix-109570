1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the cucumbers, kimchi, soy sauce, sesame oil, garlic, sesame seeds, vinegar, and sugar, using your hands to distribute the seasoning evenly. Keep aside.
2. Bring 10 cups of water to a boil, then add noodles. Cook for about 7 minutes, stirring to prevent clumping. Korean wheat-flour noodles are thin and cook fairly quick. Strain and run through cold water to chill.
3. Add the strained noodles to the salad mixture and mix roughly to dress the noodles. Put some ice in a shallow bowl, the noodles on top in a neat swirl, then use some of the salad mixture to spread over the top. Complement with Korean barley tea water to make the meal even more complete.

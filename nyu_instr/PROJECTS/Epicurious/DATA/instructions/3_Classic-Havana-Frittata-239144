1. Deep-fry the plantain and potato separately in the canola oil until golden brown.
2. In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs and heavy cream; add the paprika, salt, and pepper.
3. Place the olive oil and butter in a 10-inch sauté pan with an ovenproof handle over medium-high heat. When the butter has melted, add the onion and sauté until brown.
4. Add the plantain and potato to the egg mixture, then pour it into the pan. Cook for 5 minutes, scraping the pan regularly so the bottom sets.
5. Place under a broiler until golden brown, 7 to 10 minutes. Serve with a simple mesclun salad (optional).

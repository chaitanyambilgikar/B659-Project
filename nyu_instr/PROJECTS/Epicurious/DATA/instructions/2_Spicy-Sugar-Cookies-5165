Mix flour, salt, black pepper and cayenne pepper in medium bowl. Using electric mixer, beat butter and sugar in large bowl until well blended. Beat in egg, vanilla extract and ginger. Add dry ingredients and beat just until blended. Form dough into ball. Wrap in plastic; refrigerate at least 2 hours and up to 1 day.
Preheat oven to 350°F. Divide dough into 3 equal pieces. Roll each piece of dough between palms of hands and floured work surface to form 1 1/4-inch-diameter log. Cut logs into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Place on ungreased baking sheets.
Bake cookies until set but still very pale, about 12 minutes. Cool on racks. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Store in airtight container at room temperature.)

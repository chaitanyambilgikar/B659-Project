Prepare grill for cooking over medium-hot charcoal (moderate heat for gas). If using a charcoal grill, open vents on bottom of grill, then light charcoal. When charcoal turns grayish white (about 15 minutes from lighting), hold your hand 5 inches above grill rack to determine heat for charcoal as follows:Hot: When you can hold your hand there for 1 to 2 secondsMedium-hot: 3 to 4 secondsLow: 5 to 6 seconds
If using a gas grill, preheat burners on high, covered, 10 minutes, then, if necessary, reduce to heat specified in recipe.
Meanwhile, whisk together 1 tablespoon oil, 1/4 teaspoon cayenne, and 1/2 teaspoon each of cumin, cinnamon, and salt in a large shallow bowl. Pat pork dry and add to spiced oil in bowl, turning to coat.
Grill tenderloins on lightly oiled grill rack, covered only if using a gas grill, turning over occasionally, until thermometer inserted diagonally 2 inches into thickest end of meat registers 150°F, 16 to 18 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board, then tent loosely with foil and let stand 10 minutes before slicing. (Internal temperature will rise to 160°F while pork stands.)
Cook garlic in remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a 10- to 12-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until pale golden, 1 to 2 minutes. Add tomatoes with their juices, remaining 1/8 teaspoon cayenne, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon each of cumin, cinnamon, and salt, then briskly simmer until sauce is slightly thickened, about 10 minutes. Slice pork and serve with sauce.

Crust: Combine butter, sugar and salt in a bowl. Beat in egg, then flour, 1/4 cup at a time, until you get a shaggy dough (it holds together loosely, but it's not smooth or elastic). Dust a surface with flour, transfer dough to surface and, with lightly floured fingers, knead once or twice until a sticky dough forms. Wrap in plastic wrap; refrigerate at least 40 minutes. Heat oven to 350°F. Divide dough in half; reserve half for Chocolate-Banana Tarts or freeze, well-wrapped, for another use. Divide remainder into 4 pieces. With lightly floured fingertips, press 1 piece into each tart pan, working dough up the sides evenly. (If dough tears on bottom, smooth dough over hole to close it up.) Prick pastry along bottom with a fork several times. Gently press a small square of foil into each pastry shell (do not press down hard). Top each with 1 tablespoon uncooked rice or dried beans (to prevent pastry from puffing up). Place on a baking sheet and bake 10 minutes. Remove foil and rice from each crust; discard. Return crust to oven; cook until golden, about 5 minutes more. Keep oven on.
Filling: Combine butter and sugar. Beat in yolk, followed by flour, until combined. Beat in milk until incorporated. Divide filling among tart shells and bake until puffed, about 15 minutes.
Fruit: Heat preserves with 1 tablespoon water in a small sauté pan over low heat until melted, about 3 minutes. Press through a sieve into a bowl. Let cool. Arrange about 7 raspberries on top of each tart. Brush glaze onto raspberries and drizzle remaining glaze over raspberries until covered. Serve immediately.

Preheat oven to 325°F. Cut each pita bread horizontally in half, forming 2 pita disks. Brush disks with olive oil. Sprinkle disks with Parmesan cheese, then pepper. Cut each disk into 6 wedges. Arrange pita wedges in single layer on large baking sheets.
Bake until pita wedges are golden and just crisp, about 12 minutes. (Can be prepared 3 days ahead. Cool completely. Store airtight at room temperature. Rewarm in 325°F oven about 5 minutes.)

Place ground meat in large bowl. Add salt and pepper, and mix lightly with hands.
Shape meat into thick, one-third-pound patties, being careful not to press too hard. (The patties should be neither too thin nor too dense, so that they retain their juiciness when grilled.) Set patties on a plate and salt liberally.
Grill the patties over mesquite charcoal grill until medium-rare. Just before the burgers come off the fire, grill buns lightly.

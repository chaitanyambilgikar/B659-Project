Cut the grapefruit and oranges in half and into skinless sections. Peel and slice the avocado and put the slices into the lemon juice to prevent their darkening. Arrange the fruits on watercress and tuck spears of the endive around. Pour the Poppy Seed Dressing upon the fruit, but do not cover the endive, which may be eaten with the fingers. Serve with balls made of the Spiced Cheese Salad mixture.

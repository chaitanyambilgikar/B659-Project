1. Cut the seafood into 1/4-inch dice. (If the seafood is very fresh, this can be done up to 1 day in advance and refrigerated).
2. Preheat the oven to 350°F.
3. Add the mushrooms to the seafood and toss to mix well. Combine the mayonnaise, vinegar, soy sauce, and lemon juice in a small bowl. Set aside about 3 tablespoons of the mayonnaise mixture and toss the rest with the seafood mixture, using a slotted spoon to thoroughly combine.
4. Divide the mixture among 8 large scallop shells or 4-inch shallow gratin dishes. Top each with 1 teaspoonful of the reserved mayonnaise mixture. (The seafood may be prepared to this point up to 1 day in advance. Refrigerate, wrapped in plastic.) Bake until a fork inserted in the center comes out warm, about 12 minutes.
5. Sprinkle chives over the top and serve warm.

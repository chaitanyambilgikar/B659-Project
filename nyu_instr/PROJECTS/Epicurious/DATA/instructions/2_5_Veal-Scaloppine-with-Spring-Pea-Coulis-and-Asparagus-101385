Cook asparagus in large pot of boiling salted water until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Drain. Place asparagus in large bowl of ice water to cool. Drain; pat dry.
Spray medium nonstick skillet with nonstick spray. Heat skillet over medium heat. Add shallots and sauté 1 minute. Add peas and sauté 2 minutes. Add broth. Bring to simmer. Transfer mixture to blender. Add 1 teaspoon tarragon. Purée until smooth, about 3 minutes. Season pea coulis with salt and pepper.
Pound each veal piece between sheets of plastic wrap to scant 1/4-inch thickness. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Wrap asparagus in paper towels. Cover asparagus, pea coulis and veal separately and refrigerate.)
Spray 2 large nonstick skillets with nonstick spray. Heat over medium-high heat. Sprinkle veal with salt and pepper. Working in batches, add veal to skillets; sauté until brown and just cooked through, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer veal to platter. Tent with foil.
Divide asparagus and remaining 2 teaspoons tarragon between same 2 skillets. Sauté over medium-high heat until asparagus is heated through, about 2 minutes. Rewarm coulis in heavy small saucepan over medium-low heat.
Spoon 3 tablespoons pea coulis onto each of 6 plates. Place veal atop coulis. Arrange asparagus alongside veal.

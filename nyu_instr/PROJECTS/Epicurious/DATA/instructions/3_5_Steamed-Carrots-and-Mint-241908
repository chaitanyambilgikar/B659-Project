Place mint sprigs in bottom of large saucepan; place steamer rack in pan. Add just enough water to touch bottom of steamer rack; place carrots on rack. Cover pan and steam over high heat until carrots are just tender, 8 to 10 minutes, depending on size. Transfer carrots to bowl; toss with butter and chopped mint. Sprinkle with fleur de sel and pepper and serve.

In a 4-quart kettle cover potatoes with cold water by 2 inches and simmer until tender, 35 to 40 minutes. Drain potatoes in a colander. Cool potatoes just until they can be handled and peel. While potatoes are still warm, in a bowl mash with a potato masher or fork and stir in 3 tablespoons butter. Chop parsley and add to potatoes with garlic and egg, stirring to combine well. Chill mashed potatoes until cold. (Mashed potatoes may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.)
Form 1/2 cupfuls mashed potatoes into four 4-inch cakes. In a 12-inch non-stick skillet heat remaining tablespoon butter and oil over moderately low heat until foam subsides and cook cakes 5 minutes on each side, or until golden. (Potato cakes may be made 1 hour ahead and reheated in a 400°F oven.)

In a small bowl soak porcini in boiling water 30 minutes. Remove porcini, squeezing out excess liquid, and reserve soaking liquid. Rinse porcini to remove any grit and pat dry. Chop porcini. Line a sieve set over a small saucepan with a dampened paper towel or coffee filter and pour reserved soaking liquid through it. Add porcini to soaking liquid and boil until liquid is reduced to about 1/3 cup.
Peel potatoes and in a large saucepan cover them with salted water by 1 inch. Simmer potatoes, until they can be pierced easily with a fork, about 25 to 35 minutes. Drain potatoes in a colander and force them while still hot through a ricer or a food mill fitted with medium disk into a large bowl.
With a slotted spoon transfer porcini to potatoes in bowl and with a wooden spoon beat in yogurt, olive oil, salt to taste, and about 4 tablespoons reduces porcini liquid, or just enough to thin potatoes to desired consistency. Potatoes may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered. Reheat potatoes, tightly covered, in a preheated 500°F. oven 10 minutes, or until heated through.

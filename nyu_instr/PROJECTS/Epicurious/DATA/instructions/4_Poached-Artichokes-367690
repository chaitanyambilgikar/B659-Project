Cut the stem off at the base of each artichoke. With scissors clip off the point of each leaf. Cut about 1/2 inch off the top of each artichoke. Mix rosemary and minced garlic gloves and divide between the 4 artichokes, placing mixture between layers of leaves. Put remaining ingredients in deep, wide saucepan and add artichokes. Bring to a simmer, cover, and cook for 45 to 50 minutes, or until leaves are very tender.

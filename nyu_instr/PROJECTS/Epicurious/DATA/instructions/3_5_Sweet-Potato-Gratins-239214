1. Preheat oven to 400°F. With the butter, grease a 12-capacity muffin pan.
2. In a large bowl, toss together the sweet potatoes, Idaho potato, cream, nutmeg, pepper, and salt.
3. Layer the potato slices in each muffin cup until 3/4 full, then top off the muffin cups with any remaining cream. Sprinkle each gratin with some of the cheese. Cover the pan loosely with tinfoil and bake for 20 minutes.
4. Remove the tinfoil and continue to bake until the potatoes are fork-tender and the cheese is golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes more. Remove and let cool for 5 minutes before serving.

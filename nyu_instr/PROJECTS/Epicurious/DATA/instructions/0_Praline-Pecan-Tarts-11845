Roll out each disk of dough 1/8 inch thick on a lightly floured surface and cut out six 7-inch rounds. Fit rounds into tart pans with removable bottoms measuring 4 inches across top and 3/4 inch deep and roll a rolling pin over pan edges to trim excess dough. Pastry shells may be prepared 5 days in advance and kept covered and frozen on a baking sheet. Let shells stand at room temperature 10 minutes before continuing with recipe.
Preheat the oven to 375°F. with a baking sheet on middle rack.
In a bowl whisk together syrup, eggs, salt, rum or vanilla, and butter. Divide pralines among shells and pour in syrup mixture. Arrange pecan halves on praline mixture and press pecans to coat with mixture. Bake tarts on preheated baking sheet 20 to 25 minutes, or until tops are golden brown.

Meanwhile, combine remaining 1/2 cup cilantro, 1/4 cup shallots, 2 tablespoons lime juice, cherries, chile, and olive oil in a medium bowl. Season salsa lightly with salt and pepper and set aside to let flavors to meld.
Remove tenderloins from marinade and season generously with salt and pepper.
Grill tenderloins, turning frequently, until a thermometer inserted into meat registers 145°F, about 15 minutes. Let rest 10 minutes. Cut into thin slices and serve with salsa.

Place lentils in heavy large saucepan. Cover lentils with 4 inches of water. Season water with salt. Boil until lentils are just tender, about 25 minutes. Drain. Cool slightly.
Combine oil, vinegar, mint and garlic in large bowl. Add warm lentils; toss well. Refrigerate until well chilled. (Lentils can be prepared 1 day ahead.)
Add tomatoes, bell pepper and green onions to lentils. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Divide salad among plates. Sprinkle feta over lentils.

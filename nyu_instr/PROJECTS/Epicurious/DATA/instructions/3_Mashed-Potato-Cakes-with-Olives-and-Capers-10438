Peel the potato, cut it into 3/4-inch pieces, and on a rack in a saucepan steam it over boiling water, covered, for 8 to 10 minutes, or until it is very tender. Let the potato cool for 5 minutes, in a bowl mash it, and stir in the capers, the olives, the egg, and salt and pepper to taste. Scoop the mixture by 1/4-cup measures, form the scoops into 1/2-inch-thick cakes, and coat the cakes with the bread crumbs. In a large heavy skillet heat the oil over moderately high heat until it is hot but not smoking and in it sauté the cakes, turning them once, for 4 minutes, or until they are golden. Serve the cakes with the lemon.

Simmer maple syrup and salt in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes (do not stir). Add 1/2 cup ice cream and whisk until smooth, about 1 minute. Stir in walnuts. (Can be made 4 hours ahead. Cover and chill. Rewarm over low heat, stirring often.) Scoop remaining ice cream into bowls. Spoon sauce over and serve.

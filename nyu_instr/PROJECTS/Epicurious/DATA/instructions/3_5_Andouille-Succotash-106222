Melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add onion; sauté until soft, about 5 minutes. Add lima beans, corn, and sausage; season with salt and pepper. Sauté until vegetables are cooked through, about 8 minutes. Add tomatoes and cook 3 minutes longer. Mix in parsley and lime juice. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve.
* Andouille sausage can be found in specialty foods stores and some supermarkets. You can substitute hot links, kielbasa sausage, or smoked Hungarian sausage in these recipes.

Sprinkle veal with salt and pepper. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add veal; sauté until just cooked through, about 1 minute per side. Transfer veal to plate. Add pear, shallots and remaining 1/2 tablespoon butter to same skillet. Cook until shallots are golden, about 2 minutes. Add curry powder; stir 1 minute. Add wine and cream and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until sauce thickens and pear is soft, about 3 minutes. Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper. Return veal and any accumulated juices to sauce. Simmer until just heated through, about 1 minute. Divide veal and sauce between plates and serve.

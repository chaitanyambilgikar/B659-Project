1. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onions, garlic,and green pepper, and sauté until the pepper is very tender, about 10 minutes.
2. Sprinkle in the chili powder and paprika, and cook 30 seconds. Mix in the tomato sauce, water, hot sauce, and kidney beans, and simmer about 10 minutes, or until the mixture is hot and fragrant. Serve over rice with a small spoonful of sour cream on top, if desired.

Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter 13 x 9 x 2-inch glass baking dish. Melt first 3 ingredients in heavy medium saucepan over low heat, stirring until smooth. Remove from heat. Let cool 10 minutes.
Sift flour, baking powder and salt into medium bowl. Using electric mixer, beat sugar, eggs, espresso powder and vanilla in large bowl until blended. Add melted chocolate mixture and beat until smooth. Add dry ingredients and stir just until blended. Fold in walnuts and 6 ounces coarsely chopped chocolate.
Pour batter into prepared pan. Smooth top. Bake until top looks dry and tester inserted into center comes out with moist crumbs attached, about 30 minutes. Transfer pan to rack and cool completely. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover with foil and store at room temperature.) Cut brownies into squares and serve.

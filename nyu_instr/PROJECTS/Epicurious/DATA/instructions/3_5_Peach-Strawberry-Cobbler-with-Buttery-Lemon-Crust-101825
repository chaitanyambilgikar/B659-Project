Make fruit: Preheat oven to 375°F.
Butter 8-inch square baking dish. Mix all ingredients in large bowl. Let stand until sugar dissolves, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Transfer to prepared dish.
Make topping: Mix flour, baking powder and salt in small bowl. Using electric mixer, beat butter and sugar in large bowl until smooth. Beat in egg yolk, lemon peel and vanilla. Add flour mixture; mix just until moist dough forms. Spoon dough atop fruit, spacing evenly. Bake until juices bubble thickly and topping is golden, about 55 minutes. Cool slightly and serve with ice cream.

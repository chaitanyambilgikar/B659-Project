Boil fettuccine in a 6- to 8-quart pot of boiling salted water until al dente. Reserve 1/4 cup pasta water, then drain pasta in a colander and transfer to a heated large serving bowl. Immediately toss with butter and reserved pasta water until butter is melted. Add cheese and toss to coat. Grind pepper on top before serving.

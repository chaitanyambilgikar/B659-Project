Whisk syrup, soy sauce, and adobo in pie dish to blend. Add salmon; turn to coat. Let marinate 30 minutes, turning occasionally. Drain marinade into small saucepan.
Heat heavy nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add salmon and cook until slightly charred outside and just opaque in center, about 3 minutes per side.
Meanwhile, boil marinade until reduced to scant 1/4 cup sauce, about 4 minutes. Place 1 salmon fillet on each of 4 plates, drizzle with sauce, and serve.

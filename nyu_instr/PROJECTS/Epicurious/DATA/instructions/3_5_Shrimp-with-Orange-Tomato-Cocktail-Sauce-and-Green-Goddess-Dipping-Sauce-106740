Prepare shrimp: Bring a 6- to 8-quart pot two-thirds full of salted water to a boil, then simmer shrimp, stirring occasionally, until they turn pink and are almost cooked through (they will still be translucent in very center but will continue to cook from residual heat), about 3 minutes. Drain and cool. Peel shrimp, leaving tail and first segment of shell intact.
Make cocktail sauce: Stir together all cocktail sauce ingredients until well combined.
Make Green Goddess sauce: Purée all sauce ingredients in a food processor until smooth and light green.
Serve shrimp with sauces for dipping.

Preheat oven to 400°F. Place tomatoes, cut side up, on large baking sheet. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Drizzle tomatoes with 3 tablespoons olive oil. Roast until tomatoes are brown and tender, about 1 hour. Cool slightly.
Transfer tomatoes and any accumulated juices to processor. Using on/off turns, process until slightly chunky.
Heat 3 tablespoons oil in large pot over medium-high heat. Add garlic and sauté until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Stir in tomatoes, rosemary, thyme and dried crushed red pepper. Add chicken stock; bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer uncovered until soup thickens slightly, about 25 minutes. Remove from heat. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Rewarm soup over medium-high heat before continuing.) Stir in basil. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Meanwhile, preheat broiler. Brush both sides of baguette slices with remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Transfer to large baking sheet. Broil croutons until golden, about 2 minutes per side. Serve with soup.

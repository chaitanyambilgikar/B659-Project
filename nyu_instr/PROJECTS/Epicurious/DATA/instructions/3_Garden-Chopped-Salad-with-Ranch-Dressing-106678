1. Cut the tough ribs out of the lettuce leaves and discard the tough, darker green tops of the larger leaves. Cut the leaves into 1/2-inch pieces and place them in a large bowl. Add the bell pepper, carrots, cucumber, tomatoes, and scallions.
2. Peel and pit the avocados. Cut them into 1/4-inch dice and place in a small bowl. Add the lime juice and toss well (to prevent discoloration). Add the avocados to the other vegetables and toss with the Ranch Dressing. Before serving, season with salt and pepper. Serve with any extra dressing alongside.

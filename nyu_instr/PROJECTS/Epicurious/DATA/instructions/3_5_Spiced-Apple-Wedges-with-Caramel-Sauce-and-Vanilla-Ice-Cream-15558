Preheat oven to 400°F. Finely grind first 4 ingredients in spice mill or small coffee grinder. Place apples in 13 x 9 x 2-inch glass baking dish. Sprinkle spices over apples. Add 1/4 cup sugar, 1/4 cup cider and butter. Gently stir to coat apples.
Bake apples until tender, stirring occasionally, about 40 minutes. Cool 10 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 300°F. Using slotted spoon, transfer apples to ovenproof bowl and set in oven.
Scrape all juices from baking dish into medium saucepan. Mix in cream and remaining 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup cider. Boil until caramel sauce deepens in color and is reduced to 1/2 cup, whisking occasionally, about 5 minutes. Serve apples with ice cream and sauce.

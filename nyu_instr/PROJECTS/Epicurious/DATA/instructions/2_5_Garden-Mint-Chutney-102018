Grind onions, apples, tomatoes, the mint leaves and raisins in a meat grinder, using the coarsest blade. Place in a large pot with the salt, mustard and vinegar. Simmer over low heat about 1/2 hour or until vegetables are tender. Add sugar, turn up heat, cook until liquid is reduced to half and is slightly syrupy. Pour into hot, sterilized jars, cover and seal.

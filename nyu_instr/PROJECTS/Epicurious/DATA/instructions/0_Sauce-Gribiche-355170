Put the whole eggs and yolks, mustard, and some salt and pepper in a large bowl and mash them well together. To this paste add the vinegar and then the olive oil, drop by drop as if making mayonnaise. Keep the sauce creamy by adding small amounts of vinegar or warm water, as necessary.
Finish the sauce by adding the chopped herbs, capers, and cornichons. Taste and correct the seasoning.
To serve, arrange slices of tongue on plates and drop the sauce on top in small dollops.

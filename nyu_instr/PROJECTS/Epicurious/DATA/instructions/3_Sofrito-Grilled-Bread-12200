In a blender purée all ingredients except bread until smooth. In a small heavy saucepan simmer sofrito, stirring, 3 minutes and season with salt and pepper. Sofrito may be made 2 days ahead and chilled, covered.
Prepare grill.
If desired halve bread slices. Spread some sofrito on 1 side of each bread slice (reserving any remaining sofrito for another use) and grill, sofrito side down, on an oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals until golden brown, about 2 minutes. (Alternatively, bread may be grilled in a hot well-seasoned ridged grill pan over moderately high heat.) Transfer sofrito bread as grilled with tongs to a bread basket.

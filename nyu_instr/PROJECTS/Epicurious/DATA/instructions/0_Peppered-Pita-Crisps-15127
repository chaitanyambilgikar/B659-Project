Preheat oven to 400°F.
Split each pita into 2 rounds. With a mortar and pestle or in an electric coffee/ spice grinder finely grind peppercorns. In a small saucepan melt butter with peppercorns and salt and brush rough sides of rounds with butter mixture. Cut rounds into long narrow triangles and arrange, rough sides up, in one layer on 2 large baking sheets. Bake pita triangles in upper and lower thirds of oven, switching position of sheets halfway through baking, until golden brown and crisp, about 5 minutes total. Transfer crisps to racks to cool. Crisps may be made 1 day ahead and kept in an airtight container at room temperature. Makes about 24 to 32 crisps, depending on size of pitas.

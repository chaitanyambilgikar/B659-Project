Preheat oven to 450°F.
In a shallow baking pan arrange tomatoes in one layer, cut sides up, and season with salt and pepper. Roast tomatoes in middle of oven about 35 minutes, or until very soft and skin is dark brown, and cool to room temperature.
In a blender purée tomatoes with vinegar, honey, zest, water, and salt and pepper to taste. Dressing keeps, covered and chilled, 1 week. Serve dressing with crisp lettuce or steamed vegetables.

In a small saucepan sprinkle the gelatin over the water and let it soften for 1 minute. Heat the mixture over low heat, stirring, until the gelatin is dissolved, add 1/4 cup of the sour cream, and cook the mixture, whisking, until it is smooth. In a food processor purée the chopped salmon until it is very smooth. In a small bowl whisk together the gelatin mixture, the remaining 1/2 cup sour cream, the puréed salmon, the horseradish, the minced dill, and salt and pepper to taste and chill the mousse, covered, for 1 hour, or until it is firm. The mousse may be made 2 days in advance and kept covered and chilled.
Scoop oval-shaped mounds of the mousse onto each of 6 chilled plates, arrange the sliced salmon decoratively on the plates, and garnish each serving with a dill sprig. Serve the salmon with the toast points.

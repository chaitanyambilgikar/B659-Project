Toss crumbs with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper in a bowl and spread on a large plate.
Lightly beat eggs in a bowl. Dip mushroom slices 3 or 4 at a time into egg, letting excess drip off, then transfer to bread crumbs, pressing mushroom slices into crumbs to help adhere and turning to coat. (Coating will be uneven.) Transfer to a tray.
Heat about 1 inch oil in a 3- to 4-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat until it registers 350°F on thermometer. Fry mushrooms in batches of 7 or 8, turning over occasionally, until golden, 1 to 2 minutes per batch, returning oil to 350°F between batches. Transfer mushrooms with a slotted spoon as fried to paper towels to drain. Season with salt and serve warm.

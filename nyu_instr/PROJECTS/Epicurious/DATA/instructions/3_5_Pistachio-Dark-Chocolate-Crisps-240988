Preheat oven to 350°F with rack in middle. Line a large baking sheet with parchment.
Blend butter, brown sugar, flour, vanilla, salt, curry powder, and egg white in a food processor until smooth.
Glue parchment down with a dab of batter in each corner, then spread remaining batter evenly into a 14- by 10-inch rectangle (1/8-inch-thick) on parchment with spatula. Scatter chocolate and nuts evenly over batter, then bake until firm and golden-brown, 18 to 20 minutes. Transfer, still on parchment, to a rack to cool completely. Remove from paper, breaking into pieces.

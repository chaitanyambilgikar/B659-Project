Place pizza stone in oven. Preheat oven to 500°F. Heat 4 tablespoons oil in large skillet over high heat. Add mushrooms; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Sauté until beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Add 1/2 tablespoon thyme; stir 30 seconds. Mix in 1 teaspoon lemon juice and season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer to small bowl.
Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in same skillet over high heat. Add radicchio, leek, and 1 tablespoon thyme; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Sauté vegetables until just wilted, about 2 minutes. Transfer to medium bowl.
Divide pizza dough in half. Stretch and roll out each half on floured work surface to 101/2-inch round. Scatter half of Fontina and half of mozzarella on each round. Top each with radicchio mixture, then mushroom mixture. Sprinkle each with half of pancetta and 1 teaspoon thyme.
Bake pizzas, 1 at a time, on pizza stone until crisp and golden, about 12 minutes.
*Fresh pizza dough can be found at Italian markets and some specialty foods stores.
**Sold at many supermarkets and at Italian markets and specialty foods stores. If unavailable, regular mozzarella can be substituted.

Purée all the ingredients except the oil in a blender or food processor or with a hand-held immersion blender. With the machine running, pour in the olive oil in a steady stream. If you are not going to use the dressing within a few hours, store it tightly covered in the refrigerator; it will keep for several weeks. Bring it to room temperature and shake or whisk it well before you dress the salad.
Variations Use an herb-infused vinegar in place of the red wine vinegar.
Herb Substitutions Blend any of the following into the dressing: 1 to 2 tablespoons coarsely chopped English or lemon thyme, lovage, mint, oregano, marjoram, or French tarragon; 2 to 4 tablespoons coarsely chopped basil, dill, chervil, or chives; or 2 teaspoons fresh fennel seeds.

Bring 1 cup water to simmer in small saucepan; stir in 1 tablespoon instant espresso powder. Remove from heat. Set espresso mixture aside.
Combine sugar and remaining 1/4 cup water in medium saucepan. Stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat to medium-high and boil without stirring until caramel is deep amber color, occasionally swirling pan and brushing down sides with wet pastry brush, about 10 minutes.
Stir espresso mixture into saucepan with caramel (mixture will bubble vigorously). Stir until caramel bits dissolve, about 2 minutes. Stir in butter. Cool slightly. Stir in cream. Serve warm. (Can be made 1 week ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Rewarm over low heat just until warm and pourable, stirring frequently.)

Place peanuts in shallow bowl. Spoon 1 heaping tablespoon ice cream onto flat side of cookie. Place flat side of another cookie onto ice cream and press until ice cream spreads to edge of sandwich. Smooth ice cream. Roll edge of sandwich in peanuts to coat ice cream filling. Place sandwich on plate and freeze. Repeat with remaining cookies, ice cream and peanuts, forming 6 sandwiches total. Freeze sandwiches until ice-cream firms, at least 15 minutes. (Can be prepared 2 days ahead. Wrap tightly and keep frozen.)

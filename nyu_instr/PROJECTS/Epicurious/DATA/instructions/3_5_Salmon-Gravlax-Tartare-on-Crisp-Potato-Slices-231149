For the Gravlax Cure: Mix all the ingredients together in a small bowl. You can make the cure in advance and it will keep, stored in an airtight jar out of the sunlight, for up to 6 months.
For the Tartare: In a medium bowl, mix the salmon with 2 tablespoons of the Gravlax Cure and then add the olive oil, snipped chives, orange zest, and pepper. Cover and refrigerate overnight, or for at least 6 hours. Serve topped with a scattering of freshly minced dill on a Crisp Potato Slice or an English cucumber slice.
Strew some more minced dill on the plate or tray that you're using to pass the hors d'oeuvres — then the Crisp Potato Slices won't skid around and the cucumber will be easier to pick up.
For The Crisp Potato Slices: Position a rack in the top third of the oven and preheat to 350°F.
Arrange the potatoes in a single layer on a baking sheet; brush each slice with oil, then turn them and brush the other side. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and bake for 10 minutes, then turn slices and bake for another 5 minutes. Remove all crisp slices with a spatula and continue cooking any slices that look like they need more time. Cool on a rack, then use immediately or store in an airtight container for up to 2 days.

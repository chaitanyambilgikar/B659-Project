Scrub mussels well and remove beards. Cut bell peppers into 1/2-inch pieces and transfer half to a blender, reserving remaining half in a bowl. Chop onion and garlic. Add onion, garlic, cilantro, oregano, and cumin to blender and puree until smooth.
In a 4-quart kettle heat oil over moderate heat until hot but not smoking and cook puree, stirring, 2 minutes. Add mussels, reserved bell peppers, wine, and broth and simmer, covered, 4 to 8 minutes, checking mussels occasionally after 4 minutes and transferring them as they open to a bowl. (Discard any unopened mussels after 8 minutes.) Season sauce with orange juice and salt and pepper. Serve mussels with sauce and bread.

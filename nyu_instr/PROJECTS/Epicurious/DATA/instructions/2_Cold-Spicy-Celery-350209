Remove darker green ribs from outside of celery bunches and reserve for another use. Slice inner pale green ribs (about 16 to 18, including tiny center ones) diagonally 1/2 inch thick (aim for about 7 cups). Toss with kosher salt and let drain in a colander set over a bowl, chilled, at least 1 hour.
Just before serving, pat celery dry and toss with lemon juice, chile flakes, and 1/8 teaspoon black pepper. Drizzle with peanut oil and season with salt and sansho pepper. Serve chilled, lightly sprinkled with sansho pepper.

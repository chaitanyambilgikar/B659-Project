Make pesto Preheat oven to 350°F.
Toast pine nuts in middle of oven until golden, 8 to 10 minutes, and cool completely. In a blender or food processor blend pesto ingredients with salt and pepper to taste until smooth. Pesto may be made 2 days ahead and chilled, its surface covered with plastic wrap.
Make beans and rice Pick over beans. In a large bowl soak beans in water to cover by 2 inches overnight or quick-soak . Drain beans.
In a kettle cover drained beans and ham hock with cold water by 2 inches. Add salt to taste and simmer until beans are tender, about 1 hour. Drain beans, discarding ham hock, and keep warm in kettle.
While beans are simmering, in a large heavy saucepan bring 4 cups water to a boil and stir in rice and salt to taste. Cook rice, covered, over low heat, undisturbed, 18 to 20 minutes, or until water is absorbed and rice is tender. Fluff rice with a fork and add to beans. Stir in butter, pesto, and salt and pepper to taste.

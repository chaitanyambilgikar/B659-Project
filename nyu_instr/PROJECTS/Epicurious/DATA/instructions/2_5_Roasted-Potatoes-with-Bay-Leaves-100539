Preheat oven to 450°F. Combine oil and bay leaves in small skillet. Cook over medium heat just until warm. Remove from heat. Let stand 15 minutes so that bay leaves flavor oil.
Toss potatoes with bay leaf oil in large roasting pan. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Roast until potatoes are brown and tender, stirring occasionally, about 45 minutes. Discard bay leaves. Transfer potatoes to bowl and serve.

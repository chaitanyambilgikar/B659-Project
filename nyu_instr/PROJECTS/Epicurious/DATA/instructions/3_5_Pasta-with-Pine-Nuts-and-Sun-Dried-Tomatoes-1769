Cook fusilli pasta in large pot of boiling water until just tender but still firm to bite. Drain pasta well. Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in heavy large skillet over high heat. Add pasta and fry until beginning to crisp at edges, stirring frequently, about 10 minutes. Transfer pasta to large bowl.
Add remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil to same skillet. Add toasted pine nuts and sun-dried tomatoes and stir over high heat until just warmed through, about 1 minute. Pour pine nut mixture over pasta. Add chopped parsley and grated Parmesan cheese and toss to blend. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve.

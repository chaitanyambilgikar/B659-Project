In a large heavy skillet heat the vegetable oil until it is hot but not smoking and in it, stir-fry the onion, the cabbage, and the celery for 3 minutes, or until the cabbage is wilted. Add the sugar, the broth, the water, the soy sauce, and the sesame oil and simmer the mixture, covered, for 3 minutes. Stir the cornstarch mixture, stir it into the vegetable mixture, and bring the liquid to a boil. Stir in the turkey and simmer the chow mein until it is heated through. Serve the chow mein over the rice and sprinkle with the almonds.

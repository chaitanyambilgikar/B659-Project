If you are starting with raw salmon, start a charcoal or wood fire or preheat a gas grill or broiler; the rack should be about 4 inches from the heat source. Marinate the fish in the 2 tablespoons of olive oil and the thyme.
When the fire is ready — it should be quite hot — grill the fish for 3 to 4 minutes per side. At the same time, grill the red pepper. Cool, peel and seed it, then cut into strips.
Cool the fish, then cut it into small cubes and toss it with the lemon juice, beans, and remaining olive oil while you prepare the other ingredients. Add the tomatoes, shallots, olives, and herbs to the salmon. Taste for salt and pepper and correct the balance between olive oil and lemon juice if necessary. Serve on a bed of greens, topped with the strips of grilled red pepper.

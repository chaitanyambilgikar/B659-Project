Sprinkle steaks with salt. Spread 2 tablespoons mustard on each side of each steak. Press 1 teaspoon pepper on each side of each steak. Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add steaks and cook to desired doneness, about 5 minutes per side for medium-rare. Transfer steaks to plate; tent with foil. Add shallots and garlic to skillet; sauté 15 seconds. Stir in broth, cream, then brandy and 1 tablespoon mustard. Boil until thickened, 2 minutes. Spoon over steaks.

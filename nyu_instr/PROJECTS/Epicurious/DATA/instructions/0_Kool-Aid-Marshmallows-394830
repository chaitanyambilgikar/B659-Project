Lightly coat an 8-by-8-inch baking pan with cooking spray.
WHISK TOGETHER the Kool-Aid mix, cold water, and gelatin in a small bowl. Let it soften for 5 minutes.
STIR TOGETHER the sugar, 1/4 cup of the corn syrup, water, and salt in a medium saucepan. Bring the syrup to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally, until it reaches 240°F. Pour the remaining 1/4 cup corn syrup into the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Microwave the gelatin on high until completely melted, about 30 seconds, and pour it into the mixer bowl. Set the mixer to low and keep it running.
WHEN THE SYRUP reaches 240°F, slowly pour it into the mixer bowl. Increase the speed to medium and beat for 5 minutes. Increase to medium-high and beat for 5 more minutes. Beat on the highest setting for 1 to 2 minutes more. The finished marshmallow will be tripled in volume. Pour it into the prepared pan, using an offset spatula to smooth it into the corners. Sift coating generously over top. Let it set for 6 hours in a cool, dry place.
Use a knife to loosen the marshmallow from the edges of the pan. Invert the slab onto a coating-dusted work surface and dust it with more coating. Cut into shapes and dip the sticky edges in Pop Rocks or more coating, patting off the excess.

1. Cook the bacon over medium heat in a nonstick skillet until golden brown and crisp, about 5 minutes on the first side and 2 minutes on the second side. Drain on a paper towel.
2. Slide eggs into the skillet (with drippings) and fry until the white is set but the yolk is still soft, about 2 minutes. Carefully turn eggs over; cook 1 minute longer. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat.
3. Stir mayonnaise and chili sauce together. Spread the mixture on each slice of toast. Lay 2 slices of bacon over the mayonnaise on 2 slices of toast. Top each with a tomato slice, a fried egg, and the arugula. Cover with a second slice of toast. Cut in half and serve immediately.

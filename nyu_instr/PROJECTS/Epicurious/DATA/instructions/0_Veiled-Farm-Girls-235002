In a nonstick skillet, combine the bread crumbs, sugar, cinnamon, and butter. Stirring constantly with a heatproof spatula or wooden spoon, heat over medium heat until the crumbs are uniformly golden. Remove from the heat.
In a large bowl, whip the cream until stiff.
Layer the applesauce, bread crumbs, and cream in individual glass bowls. (I prefer at least two layers of each.) The top layer should always be whipped cream, "veiling" the dish. Sprinkle with the chopped nuts and serve.

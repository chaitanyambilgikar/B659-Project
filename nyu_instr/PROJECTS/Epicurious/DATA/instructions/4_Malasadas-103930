Combine 1 egg, 3/4 cup sugar, butter and salt in bowl of heavy-duty mixer fitted with dough hook attachment; beat until blended. Add 5 cups flour and yeast; beat 1 minute. Add 1 cup hot water, milk and vanilla and beat until well blended. Beat in remaining 2 eggs, then 1/2 cup flour. Beat until dough is smooth, soft and slightly sticky but begins to come away from sides of bowl, adding more flour by tablespoonfuls if very sticky, about 10 minutes. Scrape down dough from sides of bowl. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and towel. Let dough rise in warm draft-free area until almost doubled in volume, about 2 hours.
Punch down dough. Cut into 2 equal pieces. Roll out 1 piece on lightly floured surface to 12x16-inch rectangle. Cut lengthwise into 3 strips and crosswise into 4 strips, making twelve 4-inch squares. Repeat with remaining dough.
Pour enough oil into large saucepan to reach depth of 1 1/2 inches. Attach deep-fry thermometer and heat oil to 350°F. Fry 2 or 3 malasadas until puffed and golden brown, turning once, about 3 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer malasadas to paper towels and drain. Repeat frying with remaining dough squares, heating oil to 350°F for each batch.
Generously sprinkle warm malasadas with additional sugar. Serve warm or at room temperature.

In a kettle of boiling salted water cook orzo until tender and drain in a colander. Rinse orzo well under cold water and drain well.
In a large bowl stir together remaining ingredients until combined well. Add orzo and salt and pepper to taste, tossing well. Chill orzo 2 hours.
Just before serving gently stir in additional 1/3 cup warm water and add salt to taste. Serve orzo at room temperature.

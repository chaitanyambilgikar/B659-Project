In a large bowl filled with cold water, thaw the conch. Drain the defrosted conch then chop the conch into roughly 1/2-inch pieces and transfer to a large bowl.
In a small sauté pan over moderately high heat, heat the oil for 1 minute. Add the shallots and sauté, stirring constantly, until golden, 1 to 2 minutes. Let cool.
When the oil is cool, drizzle over the conch. Add the tomatoes, bell pepper, jalapeño, parsley, cilantro, lime juice, vinegar, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper, and toss to combine. Cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour. DO AHEAD: The conch salad can be prepared ahead and stored, covered in the refrigerator, up to 1 day.
To Serve: Serve the chilled conch salad in cocktail glasses or fruit dishes, with lime wedges and white crackers alongside.

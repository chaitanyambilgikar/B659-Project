Place haddock fillets in a large wide pot. Cover with 5 cups cold water. Place pot over medium-high heat and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until fish is just cooked, about 5 minutes. Transfer fish to a plate; let cool. Discard skin and any scales; flake fish into large pieces. Set a strainer over a medium bowl; strain poaching liquid and reserve.
[To substitute smoked whitefish for haddock: Discard bones and skin from 1 1/2 pounds smoked whitefish. Put fish, 2 thick-cut slices smoked bacon (about 2 ounces), and 4 cups water in a large wide pot. Bring to a simmer over medium heat; remove fish with a slotted spoon after 5 minutes. Continue simmering liquid (with bacon) until reduced to 2 cups, about 10 minutes. Strain liquid; discard solids. Add 3 cups water; set aside.]

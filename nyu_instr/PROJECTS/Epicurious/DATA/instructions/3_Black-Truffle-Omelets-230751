Cut truffles into slices slightly less than 1/8 inch thick with slicer.
Whisk eggs in a bowl until foamy, then add truffles and gently stir until combined. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and chill 1 hour to allow eggs to absorb truffle flavor. Add salt and pepper.
Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 200°F.
Heat 1/2 tablespoon butter in an 8-inch nonstick skillet over moderately low heat until foam subsides.
Stir egg mixture gently, then pour 1/2 cup egg mixture into skillet and cook, lifting up cooked egg around edge occasionally with a heatproof plastic spatula to let raw egg flow underneath, until omelet is set but top is still slightly moist, about 2 minutes. Fold omelet in half using spatula, then transfer to an ovenproof plate. Cover omelet loosely with foil, then transfer plate to oven to keep warm.
Make 3 more omelets in same manner, transferring to plate in oven as cooked.

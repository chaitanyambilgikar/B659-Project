Combine orange juice, sake, sugar, soy sauce, lime juice, and red pepper in heavy small saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring until sugar dissolves. Boil until mixture is reduced to 1 1/3 cups, about 5 minutes. Combine 2 teaspoons water and cornstarch in small bowl, stirring until cornstarch dissolves. Add cornstarch mixture to ponzu sauce and boil until sauce thickens and is clear, stirring frequently, about 1 minute. (Ponzu sauce can be prepared up to 1 day ahead of time. Cover and refrigerate.)
Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Brush grill with vegetable oil. Brush each salmon fillet with 1 tablespoon ponzu sauce. Grill salmon, skin side up, 3 minutes. Turn salmon fillets and brush each with another 1 tablespoon ponzu sauce. Grill until salmon is just cooked through, about 5 minutes.
Transfer 1 salmon fillet to each of 6 plates. Top with slaw, dividing equally. Sprinkle with sesame seeds; garnish with lemon wedges and serve.

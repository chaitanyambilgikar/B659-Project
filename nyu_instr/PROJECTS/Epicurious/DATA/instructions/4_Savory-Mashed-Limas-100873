Cook lima beans according to package instructions. While beans are cooking, mince garlic and in a small saucepan cook in butter over moderately low heat, stirring, until pale golden.
Drain beans in a large sieve and transfer to a food processor. Add garlic mixture, milk, nutmeg, and salt and pepper to taste and purée until smooth.

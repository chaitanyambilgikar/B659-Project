In a large bowl, whisk together the flours, baking powder, baking soda, salt, ground ginger, and crystallized ginger.
In a separate bowl, combine 1 cup of the sugar and all the remaining ingredients.
Stir the two mixtures together until moist and incorporated, shape into a disk, and cover with plastic wrap. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour, or up to 1 day.
Preheat the oven to 350°F. Place the remaining 1/4 cup sugar in a shallow bowl. Use 2 Silpats or lightly grease 2 cookie sheets.
Flour your hands and form the dough into 1-inch balls. Roll the dough balls through the sugar, and then flatten them with the greased bottom of a drinking glass or cup. Place the cookies 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets.
Bake the cookies for 18 minutes, or until slightly browned (they won't get very dark, so be careful not to keep them in too long).
Let the cookies cool on the baking sheets for a minute. Then transfer them to wire racks to cool completely.

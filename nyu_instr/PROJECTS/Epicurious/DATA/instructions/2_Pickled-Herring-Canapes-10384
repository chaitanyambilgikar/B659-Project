Spread the bread with the butter, cut into twelve 2-inch squares, and press the buttered side of the bread gently into the parsley to coat it. In a small bowl combine well the radish and the onion and divide the mixture among the bread squares. Roll up each herring strip into a coil and arrange the herring and the capers decoratively on the bread.
The canapés may be made 30 minutes in advance and kept covered and chilled. Arrange the canapés on a platter.

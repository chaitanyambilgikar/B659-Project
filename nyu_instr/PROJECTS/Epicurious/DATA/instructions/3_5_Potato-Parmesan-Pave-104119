To prepare the pavé: Preheat the oven to 350°F. In a medium bowl, toss the potato slices with the cream until thoroughly coated. Generously butter a ceramic casserole dish. Arrange 4 layers of the potatoes in the bottom of the pan and season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle half of the Parmesan cheese on the potatoes and cover with 4 layers of potato. Season with salt and pepper, sprinkle on the remaining Parmesan, and layer the remaining potatoes over the cheese. Season with salt and pepper. Bake for 1 1/2 hours, or until the potatoes are tender.

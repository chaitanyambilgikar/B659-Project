On a lightly floured surface with a floured rolling pin roll out half of dough 1/8 inch thick (about a 12-inch round). Fit dough into a 9-inch (1-quart capacity) pie plate and trim edge, leaving a 3/4-inch overhang. Chill shell 30 minutes.
On lightly floured surface roll out remaining dough 1/8 inch thick (about a 10-inch round) and with a sharp large knife or pastry wheel cut into 1/2-inch-wide strips. Put a 9-inch cardboard round (see above) on a baking sheet and arrange 4 pastry strips 3/4 inch apart in middle of round. Working with 1 pastry strip at a time, weave remaining strips over and under pastry strips on round, beginning in middle and working out to sides, and letting excess hang over round. Freeze lattice top, covered loosely, on round on baking sheet until firm, about 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 425° F.
Spoon mincemeat into shell, smoothing top. Lift lattice top together with round off baking sheet and slide pastry carefully onto pie. (If pastry sticks to baking sheet or round, pry loose carefully with a small knife.) Let lattice top soften until pliable and trim flush with rim of pie plate. Roll shell overhang up over edge of lattice top, crimping edge decoratively. Brush lattice top with egg wash and bake pie in middle of oven until pastry is golden and filling just begins to bubble around edge, about 25 minutes. Transfer pie to a rack and cool. Serve pie warm or at room temperature.

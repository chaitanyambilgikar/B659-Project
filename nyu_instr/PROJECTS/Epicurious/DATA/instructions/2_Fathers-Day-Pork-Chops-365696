Arrange pork in a single layer in a large baking dish and cover with vinegar. Let sit 1 hour at room temperature.
Set up your dredging stations: one small baking dish with flour; one with eggs; and one with panko, zest, thyme, and oregano
Heat a large cast-iron or heavy nonstick skillet over medium heat and add 3 tablespoons olive oil. Season each chop generously with salt and pepper. Have the kids use a fork to dredge each chop first in the flour, then in the egg, then in the panko mixture; make sure they coat the sides as well as the tops and bottoms, as every inch of crust is crucial. Then have the kids hand them over to Mom (or whoever is cooking) so she can put them into the hot oil. Working in 2 batches, cook pork chops—wiping out skillet with a paper towel after the first batch and adding the remaining 3 tablespoons oil—until crispy and cooked through, about 4 minutes per side.

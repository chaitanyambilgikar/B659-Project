Pound each chicken piece to thickness of 1/2 inch between sheets of waxed paper. Place chicken in baking dish. Pour 4 tablespoons lemon juice over chicken and turn to coat. Let stand 10 minutes. Beat eggs with remaining 1 tablespoon lemon juice in medium bowl. Combine breadcrumbs, Parmesan and lemon peel in shallow dish. Dip 1 chicken breast into egg mixture. Dip into breadcrumbs to coat; gently shake off excess. Season with salt and pepper. Repeat with remaining chicken, egg mixture and breadcrumbs.
Melt 2 tablespoons butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1/3 of chicken to skillet and sauté until golden brown and cooked through, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to platter and keep warm. Repeat with remaining chicken in 2 more batches, adding 1 tablespoon butter with each batch. Garnish platter with lemon wedges and serve.

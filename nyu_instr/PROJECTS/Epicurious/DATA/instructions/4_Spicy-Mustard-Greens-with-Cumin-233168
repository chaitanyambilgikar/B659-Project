Heat oil in large wide pot over medium-high heat. Add onions and sauté until soft, about 7 minutes. Stir in garlic, cumin seeds, and crushed red pepper; sauté 3 minutes. Add mustard greens to pot in batches (about 1/3 at a time) and stir until each batch begins to wilt before adding next, about 3 minutes per batch. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and cook until greens are very tender, stirring frequently, about 30 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Mix in vinegar. (Can be made 3 hours ahead.) Transfer to bowl and serve hot or at room temperature.

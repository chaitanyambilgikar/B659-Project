Whisk 2 tablespoons oil and next 5 ingredients in small bowl. Arrange salmon and scallops on separate sides in 13x9x2-inch glass baking dish. Pour marinade over and toss to coat, keeping fish and scallops apart. Let marinate at room temperature at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour, turning occasionally. Drain separately, reserving marinade.
Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle salmon and scallops with salt and pepper. Add salmon to skillet; sauté until just opaque in center, about 3 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer salmon to platter. Add scallops to skillet; sauté until just opaque in center, about 1 1/2 minutes per side. Transfer to platter with salmon. Pour reserved marinade into skillet; add mussels and clams. Cover and cook over high heat until mussels and clams open, about 3 minutes (discard any that do not open). Using slotted spoon, transfer mussels and clams to platter with salmon and scallops; cool to room temperature. Drizzle seafood with some Cilantro Dressing.
*Ground chipotle chile pepper is sold in the spice section of most supermarkets.

In small saucepan over low heat, stir together 3/4 cup water, distilled and red wine vinegars, sugar, honey, onion, ginger, cloves, salt, and pepper. Simmer, uncovered, until onions are very soft, about 5 minutes. Add apricots and simmer, uncovered, until apricots are very soft and liquid is syrupy, about 40 minutes. Cool to room temperature before serving. (Chutney can be made ahead and refrigerated, covered, up to 2 days.)

Wash zucchini thoroughly. Trim ends and cut zucchini into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Place in a large saucepan.
Wash dill and chop finely to yield 1/4 cup, reserving remaining sprigs. Add to pot with half the crabmeat and any accumulated juices. Add 1 1/4 cups water and 1 teaspoon kosher salt. Water will not completely cover zucchini.
Bring to a rapid boil. Lower heat to medium and cover pan. Cook for 20 minutes, or until zucchini is very soft. Let cool for 5 minutes. Transfer contents to a blender. Process for several minutes until very smooth. Mixture should thicken and become foamy. Add salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste and refrigerate, covered, for several hours or until very cold.
Serve soup in chilled soup bowls with a mound of remaining crabmeat in center of each serving. Garnish with reserved fresh dill sprigs.

Preheat oven to 350°F. Mix first 4 ingredients in medium bowl. Using electric mixer, beat butter, brown sugar, vanilla and almond extract in large bowl until blended. Add egg; beat until fluffy. Beat in flour mixture. Stir pecans and chocolate pieces into dough.
Using 2 tablespoonfuls dough for each cookie, drop dough mounds onto ungreased baking sheets, spacing 2 inches apart. Press tops slightly to flatten.
Bake cookies until edges begin to brown but centers are still soft, about 13 minutes. Let cool on sheets 2 minutes. Transfer cookies to racks; cool completely. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.)

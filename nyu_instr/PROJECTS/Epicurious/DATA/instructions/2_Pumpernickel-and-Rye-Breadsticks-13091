Preheat oven to 350°F.
In a small saucepan melt butter with caraway seeds and 1 teaspoon salt. Brush bread on both sides with butter mixture and slice lengthwise into 1/2-inch-wide strips. On a baking sheet sprinkle breadsticks with additional salt and bake in lower third of oven, turning once, until golden brown and crisp, about 15 minutes. Transfer breadsticks to a rack and cool completely. Breadsticks may be made 2 days ahead and kept in a resealable plastic bag.

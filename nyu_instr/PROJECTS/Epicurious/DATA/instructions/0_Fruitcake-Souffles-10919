Butter eight 1-cup ramekins and sprinkle them with the additional granulated sugar. In a small bowl combine well the fruitcake, the bread, and the milk and let the mixture stand, covered, at room temperature for 15 minutes. In a metal bowl with a portable electric mixer beat the yolks and the remaining 3 tablespoons granulated sugar until the mixture is combined well, set the bowl over a saucepan of simmering water, and beat the mixture until it is thick and pale. Remove the bowl from the pan and beat in the fruitcake mixture.
In a bowl beat the whites until they are frothy, beat in the confectioners' sugar, sifted, and beat the whites until they just hold stiff peaks. Fold the meringue into the fruitcake mixture gently but thoroughly and divide the batter among the ramekins. Bake the soufflés in the middle of a preheated 375°F. oven for 12 to 15 minutes, or until they are golden and a knife inserted in the centers comes out clean.

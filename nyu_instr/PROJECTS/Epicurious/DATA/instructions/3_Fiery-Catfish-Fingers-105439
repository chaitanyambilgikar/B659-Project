In a large bowl, stir together the mustard, egg white, and Tabasco sauce. Add the fish and toss to coat well. Cover and marinate for 1 hour.
In a shallow dish, mix together the cornmeal, flour, salt, and pepper. Pour the oil into a heavy 3-quart saucepan or deep-fryer, filling it no more than one-third full, and heat over medium heat to 350°F. Dredge the fish in the cornmeal mixture and shake off the excess. Carefully add the fish to the oil, a few pieces at a time. Cook for 2 minutes or until golden brown and crispy. Drain on paper towels. Serve the catfish hot with spicy mayonnaise or picante sauce.

1. Soak the beans in salted water overnight.
2. Rinse and add new water to cover. In a 2-quart pot, boil the beans over high heat until tender, or 20 to 25 minutes. Drain the beans and mash them with the olive oil until you achieve a creamy texture.
3. Mix in the garlic and sage. Season with salt to taste. Serve cold.

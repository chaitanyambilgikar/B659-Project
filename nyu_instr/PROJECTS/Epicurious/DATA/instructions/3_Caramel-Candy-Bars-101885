Make sable dough: Combine butter, powdered sugar, and vanilla seeds until smooth. Add the egg and mix well. Sift together the salt, almond powder and flour. Stir into the mixture and blend together. Wrap in plastic wrap, and chill until set, at least 4 hours. Roll out to 1/4-inch think. Cut to and 8-inch square, and prick the surface. Bake at 325°F, until lightly browned. Cool completely.
Make caramel layer: Combine sugar and corn syrup in a small pot. Cook over high heat until medium caramel. Add the butter, and mix in. Slowly add the cream and vanilla bean. Cook, stirring constantly, until the mix reaches 112°C (this temperature is crucial). Take mixture off heat and stir in toasted walnuts. Pour out onto a buttered 8-inch square pan. Allow to cool for several minutes. Place the caramel on top of the baked sable and press together lightly. Cut with a sharp knife to 1-inch x 2-inch pieces. Dip in dark chocolate. Set aside until chocolate hardens. Store in a cool, dry place.

Melt butter in large nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Add cabbage and cauliflower and stir until cabbage wilts, about 3 minutes. Stir in potato. Increase heat to medium. Add milk and simmer until vegetables are tender and milk is reduced to sauce consistency and coats vegetables, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. Season to taste with mace, salt and pepper and serve.

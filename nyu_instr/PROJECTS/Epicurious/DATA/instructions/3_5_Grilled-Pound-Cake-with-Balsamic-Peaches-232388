Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Whisk 3 tablespoons sugar, vinegar, and mint in large bowl to blend. Add peaches and toss gently to coat. Let stand at least 5 minutes and up to 30 minutes.
Using electric mixer, beat whipping cream and remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons sugar in another large bowl until peaks form; refrigerate.
Spread cake slices on both sides with butter. Grill until lightly browned. Arrange cake slices on 6 plates. Top each with peaches and syrup, then whipped cream.

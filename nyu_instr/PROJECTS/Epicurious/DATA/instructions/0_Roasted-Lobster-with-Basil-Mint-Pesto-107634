Preheat oven to 450°F. Blanch basil and mint leaves in large saucepan of boiling water 5 seconds. Drain. Transfer leaves to large bowl of ice water to cool. Drain. Squeeze leaves to remove excess liquid.
Mince garlic in processor. Add basil and mint leaves, 1/3 cup olive oil, and pine nuts. Puree until pesto is smooth.
Drop 1 lobster headfirst into large pot of boiling water. Cover; cook 3 minutes (lobster will not be fully cooked). Using tongs, transfer lobster to work surface. Return water to boil. Repeat with remaining lobsters, 1 at a time. Place 1 lobster, shell side down, on work surface. Place tip of large knife in center of lobster. Cut lobster lengthwise in half from center to end of head (knife might not cut through shell), then cut in half from center to end of tail (use poultry shears to cut through shell if necessary). Crack claws. Repeat with remaining lobsters.
Arrange lobster halves, cut side up, on 2 heavy large baking sheets. Discard head sac and long thin intestinal tract that runs alongside lobster tail meat. Transfer pale green tomalley (liver) from body cavity to pesto in processor. Brush lobster meat with extra-virgin olive oil. Sprinkle meat with salt and pepper.
Blend tomalley into pesto. Transfer to medium bowl. Stir in Parmesan cheese and cream, then panko and lemon peel. Season pesto mixture with salt and pepper; divide among lobster halves, filling cavities and covering meat completely.
Roast lobsters until meat is just cooked through and topping is golden, about 14 minutes. Serve with lemon.

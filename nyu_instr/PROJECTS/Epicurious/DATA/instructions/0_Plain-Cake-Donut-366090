Topping:Cinnamon sugar Preheat the oven to 325°F. Brush 2 six-mold donut trays with coconut oil and set aside.
In a medium bowl, whisk together the sugar, flours, potato starch, arrowroot, baking powder, xanthan gum, salt, and baking soda. Add the coconut oil, applesauce, vanilla, and hot water and continue mixing with a rubber spatula just until the ingredients are combined. Using a melon-baller or tablespoon, drop 2 1/2 tablespoons of batter into each donut mold. Using a toothpick, spread the batter evenly around the mold.
Bake for 8 minutes, rotate, and continue to bake until the donuts are golden brown, about 7 minutes more. Let cool in the molds for 5 minutes if sprinkling with toppings such as cinnamon sugar, or 15 minutes if using glaze or icing. Run a knife around the donuts in the molds, lift them out, and place them on a baking sheet. Coat them in cinnamon sugar .

Dry-roast dal in wok over moderately high heat, stirring constantly, 3 minutes. Reduce heat to moderately low and continue to dry-roast, stirring constantly, until dal turns medium brown and gives off a nutty aroma, about 6 minutes.
Rinse dal in several changes of water in a large bowl (hot beans will cause steam) to remove any impurities, then drain in a sieve.
Bring 3 cups water to a boil in a 3-quart heavy saucepan. Add dal and return water to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, covered, stirring occasionally, until dal is soft, 35 to 40 minutes. Pulse dal with salt and sugar in a food processor until blended, adding enough of remaining cup water to make a soupy purée.
Cut a 1-inch slit lengthwise in middle of each chile. Heat ghee with cumin seeds and bay leaves in wok or a large heavy skillet over high heat until seeds begin to sputter and release their aroma, 15 to 30 seconds. Add chiles and ginger and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Pour in dal carefully (mixture will spatter) and bring to a boil, stirring, then immediately remove from heat. (Do not eat bay leaves. Chiles can be eaten but are very hot.)

Sift flour. Bring water, orange juice, lemon zest and juice, butter, rose water, salt, and 2 tablespoons sugar to a boil in a heavy medium saucepan. Add all-purpose flour all at once and stir vigorously with a wooden spoon 3 or 4 times. Remove from heat and stir until all of flour is incorporated and dough forms a ball. Cool 5 minutes.
Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition.
Preheat oven to 200°F with rack in middle.
Heat 2 inches oil to 360°F in a wide 4-quart pot over medium- high heat.
Meanwhile, stir together almond flour, cinnamon, and remaining 1/4 cup sugar in a shallow bowl.
Working in batches of 6, gently drop tablespoons of dough into oil and fry, turning once, until puffed and golden-brown, 3 to 4 minutes per batch. Transfer with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain briefly, then keep warm in a shallow baking pan in oven. Return oil to 360°F between batches.
Roll warm beignets in almond sugar and serve immediately.

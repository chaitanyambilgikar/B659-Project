Combine lentils, onion, carrot and orange peel in heavy large saucepan. Add 2 1/2 cups water and bring to boil. Reduce heat; simmer until lentils are tender, stirring occasionally, about 25 minutes. Drain, reserving 3/4 cup cooking liquid. Discard orange peel. Return lentils to pan. Season lentils with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 1 say ahead. Cover and chill lentils and reserved cooking liquid separately.)
Preheat oven to 450°F. Place salmon on baking sheet. Wrap 1 bacon strip around center of each salmon piece, arranging bacon ends on bottom. Bake salmon until opaque in center, about 8 minutes.
Meanwhile, add enough reserved cooking liquid to lentils to moisten. Mix in cream, then parsley, chives and tarragon and bring to simmer. Spoon lentil onto plates. Top each with 3 salmon pieces in spoke fashion and serve.

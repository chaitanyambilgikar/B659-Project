Make shortcakes: Preheat oven to 375 degrees. In a large bowl, stir together flour, sugar, cocoa, cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt. Cut the butter into 1/2 cubes and distribute them over the flour mixture. With a pastry blender, cut the butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. In a small bowl, stir together the buttermilk, egg, and vanilla. Add the milk mixture to the flour mixture and stir to combine. The dough will be very sticky. Drop the dough in spoonfuls onto a greased baking sheet. Bake for about 15 minutes.
Make filling: Mix cream cheese and honey in food processor until light and fluffy.
Assembly: Cut all the shortcakes in half widthwise (like an English muffin). Spread the shortcake halves with the cream cheese mixture and top with crushed Peanut Butter Patties Girl Scout cookies. Put all of the halves together (like a sandwich). Drizzle melted white chocolate over the top and sprinkle with crushed peanuts.

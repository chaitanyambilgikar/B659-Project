1. Divide each salmon slice in two, roll them to an appropriate size, and place them on the chips.
2. Put the crème fraiche in a plastic bag and cut a little hole in one corner to make the bag work as a piping bag. Pipe about 1/2 tsp onto each salmon chip.
3. Decorate with chive, thyme, or dill.
Simplify: Make it easy on yourself by placing all the ingredients on a tray and letting your guests compose their own hors d'oeuvres.
For a challenge: Spice it up by using different types of chips such as sweet potato, delta blue potato, or daikon radish. Works well with caviar instead of salmon, too. You can also make your own chips in the oven with thin slices of potatoes.

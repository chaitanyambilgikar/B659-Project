Combine 6 quarts water and next 8 ingredients in large pot. Bring brine to rolling boil, stirring until salt dissolves. Turn off heat. Cover; let stand 5 minutes.
Return brine to boil. Add shrimp; boil 3 minutes. Pour off most of brine, leaving enough to cover shrimp. Mix in ice; let cool 10 minutes. Arrange shrimp in large bowl. Serve shrimp with Chipotle Remoulade .
What to drink: Champagne is a great pairing for this entire menu. One to try: the fruity, toasty Philippe Gonet NV Brut Reserve Champagne (France, $30).

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Blanch vegetables in water for 40 seconds (avoid overcooking). Drain and set aside.
Combine chicken broth, wine, soy sauce, fish sauce, oyster sauce, sugar, cornstarch, ginger, garlic, and shallots in a 14-inch flat-bottomed wok and bring to a boil over high heat, stirring constantly. Boil, stirring constantly, about 4 minutes, until sauce thickens. Add tofu and vegetables. Stir until heated through, about 30 seconds. Drizzle lightly with sesame oil and garnish with cilantro.

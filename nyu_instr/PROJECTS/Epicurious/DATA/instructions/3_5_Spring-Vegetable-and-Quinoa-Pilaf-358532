Bring broth and 1/2 teaspoon sea salt to boil in medium saucepan; add quinoa. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer until quinoa is tender and broth is absorbed, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat; fluff with fork. Cover and reserve.
Meanwhile, bring 1 1/4 cups water to boil in large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add beets. Cover and cook until beets are tender, about 8 minutes. Uncover; cook until any water in skillet evaporates. Increase heat to medium-high. Add olive oil and garlic; sauté 30 seconds. Add all bell peppers, asparagus, and zucchini. Sprinkle with sea salt and black pepper. Sauté until just tender, about 8 minutes. Add cooked quinoa, green onions, and parsley to vegetables in skillet; toss to combine. Season with sea salt and pepper.

Arrange the turkey halves bone side down on the grill and cook slowly for 25 minutes. Season to taste and turn skin side down. Continue cooking for 15 to 20 minutes, or until almost done. To finish cooking, bring meat close to the coals to brown. Baste during the cooking with melted butter and white wine or with seasoned oil.
Serve this broiled turkey with Epicurean Sauce .
Good accompaniments are heated potato chips, a bowl of watercress and well buttered toasted protein bread. Add a bottle of red wine, not too heavy. A fine dessert might be a bowl of giant fresh cherries and some fine small cakes. Finish with strong black coffee and cognac.

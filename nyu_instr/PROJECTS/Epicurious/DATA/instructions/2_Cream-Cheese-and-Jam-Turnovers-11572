On a lightly floured surface roll out each sheet of pastry into a 12-inch square and cut each square into four 6-inch squares. Put 1 1/2 tablespoons of the cream cheese in the center of each square, top it with 1 1/2 tablespoons of jam, and brush the edges of each square with water. Fold the squares in half diagonally to form triangles, pressing the edges together firmly, and press the edges with the tines of a fork to seal them well. Arrange the turnovers on a dampened baking sheet, brush them with the egg wash, and with a sharp knife cut several slits (for steam vents) in the top of each turnover. Sprinkle the turnovers with the sugar, bake them in the upper third of a preheated 425°F. oven for 12 to 15 minutes, or until they are puffed and golden, and serve them warm.

Preheat oven to 350° F.
In a small saucepan melt butter and stir in nuts and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Transfer nuts to a baking sheet and bake in middle of oven until fragrant and one shade darker, about 6 minutes. Cool nuts completely.
In a 2 1/2- to 3-quart heavy saucepan whisk together sugar and cornstarch and whisk in yolks, milk, and remaining 1/8 teaspoon salt until combined well. Cook custard over moderate heat, whisking, until it just comes to a boil and simmer, whisking, 1 minute. Transfer custard to a bowl and cool. Chill custard, covered, until cold. Stir in vanilla and cream until custard is combined well and freeze in an ice-cream maker. Transfer ice cream to a metal bowl and stir in nuts. In freezer harden ice cream until firm. Ice cream may be made 1 week ahead and kept frozen, covered.

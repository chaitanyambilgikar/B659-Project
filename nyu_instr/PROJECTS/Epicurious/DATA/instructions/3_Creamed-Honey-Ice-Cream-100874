In a heavy saucepan bring cream and milk just to a boil. In a bowl whisk together eggs and honey until combined well. Add hot cream mixture to egg mixture in a slow stream, whisking, and pour custard into pan. Cook custard over moderately low heat, stirring constantly, until a thermometer registers 170°F. (Do not let boil.)
Pour custard through a sieve into a clean bowl and cool. Chill custard, its surface covered with plastic wrap, until cold, at least 2 hours, and up to 1 day. Freeze custard in an ice-cream maker. Transfer ice cream to an airtight container and put in freezer to harden. Ice cream may be made 1 week ahead.

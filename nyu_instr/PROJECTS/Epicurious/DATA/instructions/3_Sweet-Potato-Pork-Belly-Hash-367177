Place another 9" glass pie dish on top of pork belly. Weight with a 15-ounce canned good. Chill overnight.
Remove skin from pork belly. Cut meat into 1/2" cubes. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add pork and sauté until browned on all sides, about 4 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer pork to a medium bowl. Season potatoes with salt and pepper. Add to same skillet; sauté until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer to bowl with pork. Add 2 tablespoons oil and shallots to skillet; sauté over medium heat until golden brown, 3-4 minutes. Return potatoes and pork with any accumulated juices to pan. Drizzle vinegar and syrup over; stir to coat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until heated through, about 2 minutes. Serve with poached eggs if desired.

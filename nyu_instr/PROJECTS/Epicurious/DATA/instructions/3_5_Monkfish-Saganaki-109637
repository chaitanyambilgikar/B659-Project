Cut stalks from fennel bulb and reserve 4 fronds for garnish, then discard stalks. Halve bulb lengthwise, core, and thinly slice crosswise.
Sauté fennel, chile, and scallions in oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat, stirring occasionally, until fennel begins to soften, 4 to 5 minutes. Add wine and bring to a boil.
Season fish with salt and pepper and add to fennel mixture. Cook, covered, over high heat until fish is just cooked through, 5 to 6 minutes. Remove lid and sprinkle feta over fish and cooking liquid, then cook, swirling skillet frequently, just until cheese is melted and sauce is creamy, 1 to 2 minutes (do not let boil). Serve fish immediately, with sauce spooned over it. Garnish with fennel fronds.

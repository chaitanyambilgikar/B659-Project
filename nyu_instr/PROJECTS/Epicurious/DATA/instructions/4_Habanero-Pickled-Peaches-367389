1. Sterilize the jars and lids in either a pot of boiling water or dishwasher. Remove jars and lids with tongs and place on a clean surface.
2. To peel the peaches, fill a large pot with water and bring to boil. Cut a small x on the top and bottom axes of each peach. Carefully drop them into the pot of boiling water and let them cook for 30 seconds. Using tongs or a long spoon, remove peaches, rinse with cold water, and then peel off the skin by gently rubbing the peach. Halve and pit the peeled peaches and put them in the jars.
3. In another pot, bring to a boil the cider vinegar and the sugar. In each jar add half the habanero chile, a cinnamon stick, and 2 whole cloves. When the vinegar comes to a boil, pour it into the jars and add enough water to the jar to fill (though be sure and leave 1/4-inch headroom from the top). Cover and refrigerate. Will be ready in a couple of days. Will last refrigerated for 1 month.

In a bowl with an electric mixer beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt until they are foamy, add the cream of tartar, and beat the whites until they hold soft peaks. Add the cinnamon and beat the whites for 30 seconds. Sift the confectioners' sugar with the cornstarch in 6 batches over the whites, beating the mixture for 30 seconds after each addition. Fold in the chocolate gently but thoroughly and drop heaping tablespoons of the mixture onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake the meringues in the middle of a preheated 300°F. oven for 30 mixture, or until they are firm when touched lightly. Turn off the oven and let the meringues stand in the oven with the door ajar for 1 hour. Transfer the meringues to a rack and let them cool completely. Keep the meringues in an airtight container.

Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 200°F.
Whisk together egg, milk, cornmeal, baking powder, salt, and scallions in a bowl until combined.
Heat 1/4 inch oil in a 10-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking. Fill a 1/4-cup measure half full with batter and carefully spoon it into skillet, then form 4 more fritters in skillet and fry, turning over once, until golden, 3 to 4 minutes total. Transfer to paper towels to drain briefly, then keep warm in 1 layer in a shallow baking pan in oven. Make more fritters in same manner (do not crowd skillet).

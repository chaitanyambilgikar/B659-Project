Drain olives, reserving brine. Rinse olives; drain well. Layer olives, oregano sprigs, garlic, lemon wedges and peppercorns in olive jar. (Reserve for another use any olives that do not fit in jar.) Add fresh lemon juice to jar. Add enough reserved brine to fill jar. Place lid tightly on jar; shake well. Let olives marinate at least 1 week in refrigerator. (Can be prepared up to 1 month ahead. Keep refrigerated.)

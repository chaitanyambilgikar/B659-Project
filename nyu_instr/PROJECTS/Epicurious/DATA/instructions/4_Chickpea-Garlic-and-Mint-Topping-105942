Slip skins from chickpeas with your fingers.
Mash garlic to a paste with kosher salt and pepper using a mortar and pestle (or mince and mash with a large knife), then whisk paste together with lemon juice and oil until well blended. Toss with chickpeas, then mash with a fork until mixture just holds together. Let stand at room temperature 1 hour for flavors to develop. Stir in mint.

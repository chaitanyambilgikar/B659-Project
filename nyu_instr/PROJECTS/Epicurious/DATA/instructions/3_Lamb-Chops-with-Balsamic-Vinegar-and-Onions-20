Season both sides of lamb chops with salt and pepper. Heat olive oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add lamb to skillet. Sprinkle onions over lamb. Cook until lamb is brown, stirring onions occasionally, about 7 minutes. Turn lamb chops and cook on second sides until lamb is cooked to desired doneness, about 5 minutes for medium-rare. Transfer lamb to platter; cover with foil and keep warm.
Add garlic to onions in skillet and sauté 1 minute. Stir in currants and sauté 1 minute longer. Add remaining ingredients and boil until liquid is reduced to glaze, about 3 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Spoon onion mixture over lamb chops.

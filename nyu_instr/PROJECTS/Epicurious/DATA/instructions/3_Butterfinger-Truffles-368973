Place chocolate and butter in a medium bowl. Bring cream to a boil in a small saucepan; pour hot cream over chocolate mixture. Let stand for 1 minute, then stir until chocolate is melted and mixture is smooth. Stir in chopped candy. Cover and chill until firm, about 2 hours.
Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil. Using a melon baller, scoop 3/4" balls (or heaping teaspoonfuls) from chocolate mixture. Roll truffles between your palms to make surface smooth. Place on the prepared sheet.
Place cocoa powder in a small bowl. Roll truffles in cocoa powder to coat. Garnish with chopped peanuts or peanut halves. Chill until firm. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Store airtight between sheets of waxed paper. Keep chilled.

Bring 4 cups water to a boil in a 4-quart heavy saucepan, then add rice and 1/2 teaspoon salt and cook, covered tightly, over low heat until water is absorbed and rice is tender, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand, covered and undisturbed, 10 minutes. Fluff rice with a fork and keep covered.
While rice cooks, heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 10- to 12-inch heavy skillet (preferably cast-iron) over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then sauté sausage in 2 batches, stirring occasionally, until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per batch, transferring with a slotted spoon to a bowl. Add okra to skillet and sauté, stirring occasionally, until browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to another bowl.
Heat remaining tablespoon oil in skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then sauté onions and bell peppers, stirring occasionally, until softened and browned, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and sauté, stirring, 1 minute. Add okra, broth, black pepper, remaining 1/4 cup water, and remaining teaspoon salt and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened and level of liquid is evaporated to just below surface of solids, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in sausage.
Toss sausage mixture with rice, scallions, and salt and pepper to taste.

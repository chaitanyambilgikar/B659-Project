Preheat oven to 350°F. Place 1 tablespoon preserves, then 6 berries in each of six 3/4 cup custard cups or ramekins. Whisk sugar, eggs, yolks, vanilla and salt to blend in medium bowl. Heat half and half over medium heat until tiny bubbles form around edge of pan. Gradually whisk half and half into egg mixture. Evenly divide custard mixture among cups with berries. Set cups into 13x9x2-inch baking pan. Pour enough hot water into baking pan to reach halfway up sides of cups.
Place pan with custards in oven; bake until custards are just set in center, about 35 minutes. Remove custards from water and cool 10 minutes. Refrigerate at least 2 hours. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and keep refrigerated.)

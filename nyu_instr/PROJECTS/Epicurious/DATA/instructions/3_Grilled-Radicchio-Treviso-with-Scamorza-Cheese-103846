Prepare grill for cooking.
Remove any loose outer leaves. from radicchio and trim bases, leaving heads intact. Quarter each head lengthwise. Brush radicchio lightly with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.
Grill radicchio on a rack over moderately hot coals (coals are ready when you can hold your hand 5 inches above rack 3 to 4 seconds), covered, turning every 10 minutes, until outer leaves are browned and hearts are tender, 25 to 30 minutes total.
Sprinkle cheese over cut sides of radicchio and grill, uncovered, until cheese begins to melt, about 2 minutes. Transfer radicchio to a platter and drizzle with vinegar.

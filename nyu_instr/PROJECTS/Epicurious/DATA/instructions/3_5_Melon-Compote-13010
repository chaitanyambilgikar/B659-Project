In a 1-quart saucepan bring sugar and water to a boil, stirring until sugar is dissolved, and simmer 2 minutes. Cool syrup and stir in lime juice, gingerroot, cumin, pepper, and salt to taste. In a bowl toss together melon balls and syrup. Chill compote, covered, at least until cold, about 2 hours, and up to 3 days.

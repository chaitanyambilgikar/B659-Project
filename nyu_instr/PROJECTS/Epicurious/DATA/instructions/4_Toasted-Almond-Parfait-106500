Using handheld electric mixer, beat sugar, egg yolks, corn syrup, and amaretto in large metal bowl to blend. Place bowl over saucepan of simmering water (do not allow bottom of bowl to touch water). Beat until candy thermometer registers 160°F and parfait base is thick and billowy, about 8 minutes. Remove bowl from over water. Continue to beat parfait base until cool, about 7 minutes. Fold in 1/2 cup almonds.
Beat cream and vanilla in another large bowl until soft peaks form. Fold cream into cool parfait base in 3 additions. Transfer parfait to 13x9x2-inch glass baking dish. Cover and freeze until firm, at least 4 hours and up to 2 days. Scoop parfait into goblets. Sprinkle with chocolate and 3 tablespoons almonds.

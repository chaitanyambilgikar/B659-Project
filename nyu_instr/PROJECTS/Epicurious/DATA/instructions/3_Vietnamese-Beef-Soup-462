Bring large pot of water to boil. Remove from heat. Add noodles to pot; let stand until tender and pliable, about 15 minutes. Drain. Using scissors, cut noodles into 2-inch lengths. Transfer to bowl.
Combine beef broth, sliced onions, sliced ginger, fish sauce, garlic, star anise and whole cloves in heavy large Dutch oven and bring to boil. Reduce heat; simmer 30 minutes. Strain broth into large bowl; discard solids. (Noodles and broth can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover separately and refrigerate. Bring noodles to room temperature before continuing.) Return beef broth to Dutch oven and bring to boil. Remove beef broth from heat. Mix steak slices into broth (the hot broth will cook steak slices).
Place noodles, soup, sliced lettuce, sliced green onions and lemon wedges in center of table. Spoon noodles, steak slices and broth into large soup bowls, then top with generous amounts of sliced lettuce and green onions and squeeze in lemon juice.

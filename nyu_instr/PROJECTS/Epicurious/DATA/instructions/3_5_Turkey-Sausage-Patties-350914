Preheat oven to 250°F.
Cook onion in 1 tablespoon oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from heat.
Meanwhile, stir together bread crumbs and milk in a large bowl and let stand 5 minutes.
Add onion to crumbs (reserve skillet), then add turkey, nutmeg, cinnamon, cayenne, cloves, yolks, 2 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon black pepper and combine well.
Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Form 24 (2-inch-wide) patties (about 1/2 inch thick) with damp hands and arrange on sheet.
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in skillet over medium heat until hot, then cook patties in batches, turning once, until browned and just cooked through, about 8 minutes per batch. Drain briefly on paper towels, then keep warm in a baking pan, loosely covered with foil, in oven. Wipe out skillet and add 1 tablespoon oil between batches.

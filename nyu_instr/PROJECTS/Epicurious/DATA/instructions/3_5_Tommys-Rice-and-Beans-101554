In a large sauté pan, heat the oil over medium-high heat until hot but not smoking. Add the onion, and sauté, stirring occasionally, until transparent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the garlic and roasted pepper, and sauté, stirring occasionally, for an additional 2 minutes.
Add the black beans, vinegar, and Tabasco sauce. Bring the mixture to a boil; reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer 5 minutes.
Add the cilantro and rice; mix well. Season to taste with the salt and black pepper. Serve accompanied by additional hot pepper sauce.

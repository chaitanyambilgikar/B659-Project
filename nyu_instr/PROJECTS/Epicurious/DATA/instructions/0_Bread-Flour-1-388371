Weigh out each dry ingredient using a kitchen scale. Weights are provided for a single recipe here.
The amount of gum, salt, baking powder, and baking soda per single recipe are too small to weigh out. Instead, measure these in teaspoons and tablespoons and add to your blend.
For larger batches: on a worksheet, multiply each ingredient by the number of recipes you would like to create. (I find that 5 or 10 work well.) Measure out the same multiple for the smaller ingredients like the gum, salt, baking powder, and baking soda, in teaspoons and tablespoons. Weigh this quantity in grams and write down the amount for future use.
Now you are ready to make a large batch of a blend anytime you wish. Simply weigh ingredients in the multiple you've chosen and place the ingredients in a large bowl or plastic container. Mix very well.

Combine tuna, olives, onion, anchovies, mustard, parsley, capers, vinegar and oil in a bowl, using a fork to break up chunks of tuna. Divide tomato and lettuce among 4 bottom pieces of baguette; top each of the slices with 1/4 of the tuna mixture. Cover sandwiches with remaining pieces of bread; serve.

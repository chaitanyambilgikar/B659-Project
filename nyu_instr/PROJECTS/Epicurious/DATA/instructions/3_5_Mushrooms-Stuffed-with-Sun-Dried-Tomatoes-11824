Preheat oven to 400°F.
In a small bowl soak tomatoes in hot water to cover 5 minutes. Reserving 1 tablespoon soaking liquid, drain tomatoes well and chop fine. In a small skillet heat oil over moderate heat until hot but not smoking and cook chopped mushrooms stems and shallots, stirring until shallots are softened. In a bowl stir together mushrooms mixture, bread crumbs, tomatoes, reserved soaking liquid, yolk, parsley, basil, and salt to taste. Mound stuffing in reserved mushroom caps and arrange caps in a lightly greased shallow baking dish. Sprinkle mushrooms with Parmesan and bake in middle of oven 15 minutes.

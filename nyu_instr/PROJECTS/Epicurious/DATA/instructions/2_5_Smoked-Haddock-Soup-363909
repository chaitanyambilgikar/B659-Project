Wrap the rosemary, thyme, bay leaves, and peppercorns in the cheesecloth and secure with the kitchen string. Set aside.
In a medium saucepan over moderate heat, melt the butter. Add the leeks and fennel and sauté, stirring occasionally, until softened, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the heavy cream and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, add the herb package, and simmer until the soup is reduced by about one third, 20 to 25 minutes. Add haddock, cover, and simmer an additional 5 minutes. Season to taste. Divide soup among 8 bowls, making sure to evenly distribute the fish and vegetables. Sprinkle each dish with dill and serve immediately.

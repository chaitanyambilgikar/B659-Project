In a small heavy saucepan combine the water, the butter, and a pinch of salt and bring the mixture to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to moderate, add the flour all at once, and with a wooden spoon beat the mixture until it pulls away from the sides of the pan and forms a ball. Remove the pan from the heat, add the eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition, and stir in the Stilton, the bacon, the scallion, and salt and pepper to taste. Drop rounded teaspoons of the batter 2 inches apart onto lightly buttered baking sheets and bake the puffs in the middle of a preheated 425°F. oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until they are crisp and golden.

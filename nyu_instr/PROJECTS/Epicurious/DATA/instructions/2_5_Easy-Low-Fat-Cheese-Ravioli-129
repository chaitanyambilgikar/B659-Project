Mix first 6 ingredients in medium bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Place 1 rounded teaspoon filling in center of gyoza wrapper. Brush edge of gyoza wrapper lightly with water. Fold wrapper in half, enclosing filling completely. Pinch edges to seal. Transfer ravioli to baking sheet. Repeat with remaining filling and wrappers. (Can be prepared up to 2 hours ahead; refrigerate.)
Bring large pot of salted water to boil. Carefully add ravioli to pot. Cook until ravioli are just tender, stirring gently, about 3 minutes. Using large slotted spoon, transfer ravioli to bowls. Pour sauce over ravioli. Sprinkle each with 1/2 tablespoon cheese. Garnish with additional basil and serve immediately.

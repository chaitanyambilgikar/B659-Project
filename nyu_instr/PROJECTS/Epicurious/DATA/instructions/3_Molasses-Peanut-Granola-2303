Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 325°F. Spray large roasting pan with nonstick vegetable oil spray. Mix oats, peanuts and coconut in prepared roasting pan. Combine molasses, brown sugar, 1/4 cup water and oil in heavy small saucepan. Bring to boil, stirring occasionally. Pour hot molasses mixture over oat mixture; toss to coat well.
Bake granola 20 minutes. Stir raisins into granola. Bake until granola is deep golden, stirring frequently, about 15 minutes longer. Transfer pan to rack. Using metal spatula, scrape bottom of pan to loosen granola. Cool completely in pan, occasionally scraping bottom of pan with spatula to prevent granola from sticking.

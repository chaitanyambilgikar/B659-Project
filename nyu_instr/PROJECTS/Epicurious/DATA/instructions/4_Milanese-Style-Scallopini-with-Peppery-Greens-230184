For dressing, whisk oil, vinegar, and orange juice in a bowl. Efficiency tip: Cross a serving fork and spoon in bowl and place greens on top (so they don't touch the dressing). Cover and refrigerate; toss before serving.
In a casserole, combine breadcrumbs, Parmesan, rosemary, and salt and pepper to taste. In a bowl, beat egg and 1 tbsp water. Dip cutlets in egg wash, then dredge through breadcrumb mixture. Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet. Add garlic and cook 30 seconds. Add cutlets. Cook 1 to 2 minutes on each side or until golden. Arrange cutlets on 2 dinner plates with dressed greens next to each. Garnish with lemon wedges.

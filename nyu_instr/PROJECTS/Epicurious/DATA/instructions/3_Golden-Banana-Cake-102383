Preheat the oven to 325°F. Butter an 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 x 2 1/2-inch loaf pan. Dust the pan with flour, tapping out the excess.
Sift together the flour, baking powder, and baking soda.
In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mix together the butter, olive oil, and sugar at low speed. Increase the speed to medium and add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Mix in the mashed banana. Add the flour mixture and mix just until combined. Scrape the batter into the prepared pan, smoothing the top with a spatula.
Bake the cake for 55 to 60 minutes, until the top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean. Cool the cake in the pan on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Unmold the cake and cool completely on the rack. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for 3 days, 1 week refrigerated, or 2 months frozen.

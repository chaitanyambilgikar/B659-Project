Only very young, fresh-killed turkeys weighing from 3 1/2 to 5 pounds broil successfully. Split the turkey and remove the breastbone and backbone. Rub well with oil, salt, pepper and paprika. A clove or two of garlic, finely chopped, may be rubbed into the skin and along the bone of the bird. This gives the turkey a delicious flavor.
Adjust the broiling pan about 4 to 5 inches from the heat and boil the turkey, bone side to the heat, for approximately 25 minutes, basting occasionally with a little melted butter. Turn at the end of 25 minutes, brush with butter or olive oil, and broil until nicely browned and cooked through, about 18 to 25 minutes more. Be careful not to overcook, or the white meat will be dry and uninteresting.
Serve the broiled turkey with matchstick potatoes and a good salad. Drink a Beaujolais such as Juliénas.
Variation: Marinate the turkey in one cup white wine, 1/2 cup Japanese soy sauce, 3 cloves garlic finely chopped, 1/4 cup olive oil and one tablespoon Tabasco. Turn the turkey several times during the marinating period. Broil as directed and baste with marinating liquid. Serve with fried rice and tiny cooked green beans with crisp, crumbled bacon and onion.

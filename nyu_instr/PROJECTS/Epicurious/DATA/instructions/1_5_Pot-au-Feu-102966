1. Tie the top or bottom round, the beef checks, and the pot roast separately so they are compact and don't fall apart during cooking. Place them, with the oxtails, in a large, deep stockpot. Add the salt, cover by at least two inches with water and bring just to a boil, then reduce the heat so the liquid is simmering. When impurities begin to rise to the surface of the water skim them off, and continue skimming until you see no more impurities, which should take about 20 minutes.
2. Pierce the onions with the cloves and cut the onions in half.
3. Add half the vegetables and the bouquet garni to the meat in the pot and make sure all is covered by at least one inch with water. Add half the peppercorns, cover, and bring just to a boil. Adjust the heat so the liquid is simmering—it shouldn't boil or the meat will be tough. Cook, partially covered, for at least three hours.
4. Remove the meat from the broth. Strain the broth and discard vegetables. Return broth to the pot and add bay leaves. Bring it just to a boil. Add the carrots and the rutabaga and cook until they're beginning to turn tender, about 10 minutes. Add the turnips and onions and cook until they're beginning to turn tender, about 10 minutes. Add celery root and leeks and cook until they, and all the vegetables, are tender through. Remove vegetables from the broth and place them in a shallow bowl. Moisten with some of the broth, cover, and keep them warm. Add the meat back to the broth along with the marrow bone and simmer for 15 minutes. Remove the meat from the broth, drizzle it with a ladle or two of broth and keep it warm.
5. Rub each piece of bread with garlic and place it in the bottom of a shallow bowl. Pour equal amounts of broth over it and serve as a first course.
6. Remove the strings from the meat and cut the pieces either into thick slices or into chunks. Arrange the meat on a warmed platter surrounded with the vegetables. Serve it with the condiments alongside.

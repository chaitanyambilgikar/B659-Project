Combine all ingredients except pear in a small saucepan. Add 1/2 cup water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 5 minutes to meld flavors. Remove from heat and let sit until warm.
Place pear cubes in a 12-ounce jar with a tight-sealing lid. Add warm pickling liquid. Let cool at room temperature for 30 minutes. Cover and chill. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 week ahead. Keep chilled.

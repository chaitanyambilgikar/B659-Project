For meringues: Preheat oven to 225°F. Line large baking sheet with parchment paper. Using electric mixer, beat egg whites and cream of tartar in large bowl until soft peaks form. Gradually add sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, and beat until stiff and glossy, about 8 minutes.
Using generous 1/3 cup meringue for each, scoop 8 dollops of meringue onto prepared baking sheet, spacing apart. Using back of spoon, make 2 1/2-inch-wide indentation in center of each meringue, spreading meringues to form 3 1/2-inch-diameter nests.
Bake meringues until crisp, about 1 1/2 hours. Cool. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.)
For filling: Bring 1/2 cup cream to simmer in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat. Add 8 mint sprigs; remove from heat. Cover; let steep 30 minutes. Strain mixture into bowl; discard mint.
Combine egg yolks, sugar, lemon juice, and lemon peel in heavy medium saucepan. Whisk constantly over medium-low heat until mixture thickens and instant-read thermometer inserted into mixture registers 160°F, about 5 minutes. Transfer custard to glass bowl; whisk in mint-infused cream. Refrigerate until cold, at least 1 hour.
Using electric mixer, beat remaining 1/2 cup cream in medium bowl until peaks form. Fold into lemon mixture. (Filling can be made 6 hours ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
Spoon filling into meringue shells. Garnish with additional mint sprigs.

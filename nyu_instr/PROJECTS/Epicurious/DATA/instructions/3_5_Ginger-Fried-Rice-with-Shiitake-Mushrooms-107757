Heat a wok or a 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderate heat until hot, then add 1/2 teaspoon vegetable oil and swirl around wok. Add half of egg mixture and swirl wok to coat bottom with a thin layer about 5 inches in diameter. When egg crêpe is set, about 45 seconds, transfer with a wide metal spatula to a plate to cool. Make another egg crêpe with another 1/2 teaspoon vegetable oil and remaining egg mixture in same manner. Stack crêpes, roll into a cylinder, and cut crosswise into 1/4-inch-wide strips, then unroll.
Heat remaining 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in wok over high heat until it begins to smoke. Add ginger, white part of scallions, and salt and stir-fry until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add shiitakes and stir-fry until tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Crumble rice into wok and stir-fry until lightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat and add scallion greens, egg strips, and sesame oil, tossing to combine.

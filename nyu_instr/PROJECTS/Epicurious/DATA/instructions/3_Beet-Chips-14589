Peel beets. Using a mandoline or other manual slicer cut beets into paper-thin slices and transfer to a large bowl. Add cornstarch and toss well to coat.
In a 3-quart saucepan heat oil until a deep-fat thermometer registers 350°F. Working in batches of 8 to 10 slices, separating them from one another, fry beets, turning once or twice, until crisp and beginning to shrivel, 30 seconds to 1 minute, making sure oil returns to 350°F before adding next batch. Transfer chips as fried with a large slotted spoon to paper towels to drain and season with salt. Beet chips may be made 12 hours ahead and kept, uncovered, at room temperature.

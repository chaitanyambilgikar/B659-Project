Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium high heat. Add onions and cook until golden brown and soft, stirring often, about 25 minutes. Add garlic and marjoram; cook until garlic softens, about 3 minutes. Add tomato paste and cook until mixture begins to turn dark red, stirring often, about 3 minutes. Add both paprikas and stir to blend; remove from heat and let stand 1 minute for flavors to blend. Add vinegar; stir over medium heat until almost all liquid is absorbed, about 2 minutes. Add broth, bay leaves, and lemon peel; increase heat and bring to boil.
Sprinkle beef with salt and pepper; add to pot. Simmer over medium-low heat until beef is tender, stirring occasionally, about 2 1/2 hours.
Transfer beef to bowl, leaving onions in pot. Boil sauce in pot until reduced to 5 cups, about 15 minutes. Cool slightly. Working in batches, puree sauce in blender until smooth; return to pot. Season with salt and pepper. Return beef to pot. Simmer until heated through, about 5 minutes. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 days ahead. Cool slightly. Chill uncovered until cool, then cover and chill. Rewarm before serving.
What to drink: In keeping with the spirit of this menu, pour an Austrian red with the gulasch. The fruity, elegant Feiler-Artinger 2007 Zweigelt ($19) is a good choice.

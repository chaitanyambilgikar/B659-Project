Shave zucchini lengthwise into very thin ribbons with peeler.
For each piece of fish, arrange about 5 slices of zucchini on a work surface, side by side, overlapping each slice by half. Brush zucchini with oil, then lightly season with salt and pepper. Lay 2 basil leaves across center of each group of zucchini slices.
Pat fish dry, then sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper (total) and arrange crosswise on zucchini, covering basil leaves. Top each piece of fish with 2 basil leaves, then wrap zucchini around fish, overlapping ends.
Put 1 tablespoon oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet and swirl to coat bottom, then arrange fish, seam sides down, in oil. Lightly brush tops of zucchini and fish with oil.
Cover skillet and cook fish over medium heat, without turning, until barely cooked through, 6 to 9 minutes, depending on thickness of fillets (fish will continue to cook from residual heat).
Transfer fish to plates, then stir lemon juice and remaining 2 tablespoons oil into juices in skillet and season sauce with salt and pepper. Drizzle sauce over fish.

Cover rice with 2 to 3 inches cold water in a large bowl and soak at room temperature at least 3 hours.
Drain rice and put in a steamer basket (see cooks' note, below) lined with cheesecloth. Steam rice, covered with lid, over boiling water until shiny and tender, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, 5 minutes. Serve hot, warm, or at room temperature.

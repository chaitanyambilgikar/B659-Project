Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add lamb and sauté until cooked through, breaking up with back of spoon, about 5
minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer lamb to bowl.
Reduce heat to medium. Add garlic, ginger and chili to same skillet and sauté 2 minutes. Add cardamom, curry powder and orzo and stir to 1 minute. Add broth and bring mixture to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and cook until orzo is tender and most of broth is absorbed, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking on bottom of skillet, about 15 minutes. Return lamb to skillet and mix in. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Mound pilaf on large platter. Garnish with tomato and cilantro and serve.

In a blender purée the coconut with the water and the zest at high speed for 1 minute, let the mixture stand for 10 minutes, and force it through a fine sieve set over a bowl, pressing hard on the solids. Chill the coconut milk, covered, until it is very cold. Put the melon in a serving bowl, pour the coconut milk over it, and serve the dessert immediately.

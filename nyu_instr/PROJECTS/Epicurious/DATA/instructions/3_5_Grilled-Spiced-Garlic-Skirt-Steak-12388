Prepare grill.
Cut steak into large pieces if necessary to fit on grill.
In a small bowl stir together remaining ingredients. On a sheet of wax paper spread spice paste evenly on both sides of steak. Marinate steak at room temperature 15 minutes.
Grill steak on an oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals 3 to 5 minutes on each side, or until just springy to the touch, for medium-rare meat. (Alternately, steak may be grilled in a hot well-seasoned ridged grill pan over moderately high heat.)
On a cutting board let steak stand 5 minutes and cut diagonally across grain into thin slices. Serve steak with quesadillas.

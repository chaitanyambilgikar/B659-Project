Cook bacon in a 6- to 8-quart heavy pot over medium heat, stirring frequently, until crisp, about 5 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to a small bowl.
Pour off all but 2 tablespoons bacon fat. Add onion, carrots, celery, and bell pepper to pot and cook, stirring, until onion is softened, 10 to 12 minutes.
Add Yukon gold and sweet potatoes, broth, and water, and simmer, covered, until potatoes are just tender, about 15 minutes. Add corn and cream and simmer, uncovered, 10 minutes.
Remove pot from heat, then stir in cheese until melted. Season soup with salt and pepper and stir in bacon and basil. Garnish with fresh chives, scallions, or paprika (if desired).

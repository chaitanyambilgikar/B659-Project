Pick over the beans, removing any broken pieces and pebbles, and rinse well. Place in a bowl, add water to cover generously, and let soak for at least 2 hours or up to overnight.
Drain the beans, place in a pot, and add water to cover by about 2 inches. Bring the beans to a boil over high heat, adjust the heat to a slow simmer, and cook, uncovered, for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, or until tender. Season with 1 teaspoon salt and remove from the heat. Let cool completely, transfer the beans and their liquid to a storage container, and refrigerate overnight. Drain the beans, reserving their liquid. You should have 1 to 2 cups liquid, and you will need 2 cups for this recipe. If you have less than 2 cups, add water to the cooking liquid to bring it to 2 cups.
In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, heat 1/3 cup of the olive oil over medium heat. Stir in 3 of the garlic cloves, the strips of lemon zest, 1 bay leaf, and 2 teaspoons kosher salt and cook, stirring occasionally, for 3 minutes, or until the garlic begins to soften. Add the octopus, stir to coat it with the oil, and then weight it down with a plate or lid to ensure it does not begin to float once it starts releasing its water. Cover the pot and adjust the heat to a gentle simmer. The octopus should start slowly releasing its water, creating its own braising liquid.
Cook for about 30 minutes and check to see how much braising liquid is in the pot. If it is about 1 cup or less (unlikely if you are using an uncooked whole octopus), add 1 cup of water. Check the tenderness and continue to cook for 30 to 50 minutes longer, or until almost completely tender. The octopus will dramatically decrease in volume. Remove the pot from the heat and allow the octopus to cool in the braising liquid for 1 hour.
Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Add the escarole and cook for about 3 minutes, or until tender. Drain well and when cool enough to handle, chop the leaves coarsely and set aside.
Place a colander over a large bowl. Once the octopus has cooled for 1 hour, transfer it to the colander. Strain the braising liquid through a fine-mesh strainer into a measuring pitcher. Add any extra liquid that has drained from the octopus into the bowl to the braising liquid. You will need 1 cup for the zuppa. Give the pot used to cook the octopus a quick wash and return it to the stove.
Transfer the octopus to a large cutting board. Starting at the thickest point of the tentacle, slice into 1/4-inch-thick-pieces, increasing the thickness of the pieces as the tentacle becomes narrower. Halve the head, then cut it into 1/4-inch strips. Set aside.
To prepare the zuppa, heat the remaining 1/3 cup olive oil in the cleaned pot over medium heat. Add the remaining 3 garlic cloves, the celery, the chiles, and the remaining bay leaf and stir well. Stir in the beans and the reserved cooking liquid. Stir in the octopus and the reserved braising liquid. Heat until hot and then taste for seasoning, adding more salt if needed. Stir in the escarole and simmer for a few minutes more.
Ladle the soup into warmed bowls. Top each serving with a drizzle of olive oil. Serve immediately.

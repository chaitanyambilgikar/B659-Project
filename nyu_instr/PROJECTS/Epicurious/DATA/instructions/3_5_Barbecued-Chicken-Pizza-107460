Preheat oven to 450°F. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat. Season chicken with salt and pepper. Sauté chicken until cooked through, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to cutting board. Cut chicken into 1/2-inch dice; place chicken in large bowl.
Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil and onion to same skillet; sauté over medium-high heat 2 minutes. Add zucchini and yellow squash; sauté until crisp-tender, about 4 minutes. Transfer vegetable mixture to bowl with chicken and cool. Mix in cheese and 1/3 cup cilantro. Season topping to taste with salt and pepper.
Place pizza crust on large baking sheet. Spread 4 tablespoons barbecue sauce over crust. Top with chicken mixture. Drizzle with remaining 2 tablespoons sauce. Bake pizza until heated through and cheese melts, about 15 minutes. Sprinkle with remaining 3 tablespoons cilantro and serve.

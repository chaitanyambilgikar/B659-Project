Heat olive oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add sliced red onions and sliced red bell peppers and sauté until beginning to brown, stirring frequently, about 10 minutes. (Can be prepared 4 hours ahead. Let onion mixture stand at room temperature.)
Preheat oven to 450°F. Place Boboli on pizza pans or cookie sheets. Spread each Boboli with half of olive paste. Top each with half of onion mixture. Sprinkle with crumbled goat cheese. Bake until cheese softens, about 10 minutes. Remove from oven. Sprinkle with chopped fresh oregano and toasted pine nuts. Cut pizzas into wedges and serve.
*An olive spread available at Italian markets and specialty foods stores. If unavailable, use pureed, pitted, brine-cured black olives.

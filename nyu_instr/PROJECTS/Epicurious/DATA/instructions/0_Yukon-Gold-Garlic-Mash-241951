1. Bring a pot of water to a boil.
2. Wash potatoes and halve. Add to boiling water and cook until very tender, about 25 minutes. Drain, return to the pot and shake over low heat for 10 seconds to dry out. When cool, remove and discard the skins.
3. Mash potatoes in a bowl. Warm the milk with the butter and grated garlic in a small saucepan over low heat. Mix into the potatoes until smooth. Season with salt and pepper and stir in the chives. Serve immediately.

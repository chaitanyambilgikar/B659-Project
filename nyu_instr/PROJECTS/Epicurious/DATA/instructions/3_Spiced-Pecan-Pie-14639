On a lightly floured surface with a floured rolling pin roll out pastry dough into a 17-inch round (about 1/8 inch thick). Fit dough into a 10-inch glass pie plate (1 1/2 quarts), and crimp edge decoratively. Chill shell, covered, at least 1 hour and up to 1 day.
Preheat oven to 350°F.
In an electric coffee/spice grinder finely grind anise seeds. In a dry heavy saucepan cook 1/2 cup sugar over moderately low heat, stirring slowly with a fork (to help sugar melt evenly), until melted and pale golden. Cook caramel, without stirring, swirling pan, until deep golden. Add corn syrup and simmer, stirring occasionally, until caramel is dissolved (caramel will harden before dissolving).
In a bowl whisk together remaining 3/4 cup sugar, eggs, spices, and salt. Remove pan from heat and cool caramel mixture until it stops bubbling. In a slow stream carefully whisk caramel mixture into egg mixture. Spread pecans in shell and pour in filling, tapping down pecans to coat thoroughly.
Bake pie in middle of oven until crust is pale golden, 40 to 45 minutes (filling will not be set), and transfer to a rack to cool completely (filling will continue to set as pie cools).
Serve pie with ice cream.

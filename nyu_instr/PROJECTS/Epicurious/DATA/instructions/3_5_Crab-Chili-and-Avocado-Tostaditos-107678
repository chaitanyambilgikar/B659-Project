Heat enough vegetable oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat to reach depth of 1 inch. Working in batches, add tortillas and fry until crisp, about 45 seconds per side. Transfer to paper towels to drain. (Fried tortillas can be made 1 day ahead. Cool tortillas completely and store in resealable plastic bag at room temperature.)
Heat olive oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add poblano chilies, bell peppers, onion, garlic, and jalapeño; sauté until just beginning to soften, about 12 minutes. Transfer to large bowl; cool.
Mix crab, tomatoes, Cotija cheese, pumpkin seeds, cilantro, and lime juice into vegetable mixture. Season with salt and pepper. (Crab mixture can be made 4 hours ahead. Cover and chill.)
Preheat broiler. Place tortillas in single layer on 2 baking sheets. Top with crab mixture and avocado. Sprinkle with Monterey Jack cheese. Broil until cheese melts, about 30 seconds, then serve.
*Fresh green chilies that are often called pasillas; available at Latin American markets and some supermarkets.

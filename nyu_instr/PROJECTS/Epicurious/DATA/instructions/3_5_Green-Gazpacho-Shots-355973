1. Blend the lime juice, vinegar, oil, cilantro leaves, and cumin in the small bowl with a wooden spoon.
2. Place the zucchini, tomatillos, bell pepper, cucumber, onion, and green tomatoes in batches in the bowl of the food processor fitted with the steel blade. Process, adding the lime juice mixture, 2 tablespoons at a time, to prevent the blade from being clogged with the vegetables. The soup should have a crunchy texture; do not puree the vegetables. Pour the soup into the large bowl as each batch is processed.
3. When all the vegetables have been processed, add just enough vegetable broth to give the gazpacho a smoother consistency. Season the soup with the Tabasco sauce and salt to taste.
4. Refrigerate, covered, for 2 1/2 to 3 hours before serving.
To Serve: Fill the shot glasses three-quarters full with the gazpacho. Top each glass with a dollop of sour cream. Arrange the glasses on a large tray, with the bunch of cilantro in the center. Guests can help themselves.

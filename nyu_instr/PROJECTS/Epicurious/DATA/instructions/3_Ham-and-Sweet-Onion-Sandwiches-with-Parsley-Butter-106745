Finely chop parsley in a food processor, then add butter and salt and blend to a paste.
Cut 4 (1/8-inch-thick) slices crosswise from center of onion, reserving remainder for another use.
Spread 1 1/2 teaspoons parsley butter on 1 side of each slice of bread. Arrange 1 onion slice on each of 2 bread slices and spread each with 1 1/2 teaspoons parsley butter, then top each with one fourth of ham. Repeat layering with remaining onion, parsley butter, and ham, then cover with remaining bread slices, buttered sides down.

Preheat oven to 325°F. Spray 9-inch-diameter springform pan with 2 3/4-inch-high sides with nonstick spray. Line bottom with parchment. Double-wrap outside of pan with heavy-duty aluminum foil.
Using electric mixer, beat cream cheese, peanut butter, and sugar in large bowl until well blended and fluffy. Beat in sour cream. Beat in eggs 1 at a time, then vanilla. Stir in peanut butter chips. Transfer batter to prepared pan.
Place springform pan in large roasting pan. Fill roasting pan with enough hot water to come 1 inch up sides of springform pan. Bake cake until slightly firm to touch and top appears dry, about 1 hour.
Refrigerate cake uncovered until cold, at least 4 hours. (Can be prepared 2 days ahead; cover and keep refrigerated.)
Cut around pan sides to loosen cheesecake; release sides. Invert cake onto platter; peel off parchment. Brush apricot jam over top of cake. Sprinkle 1 1/2 cups peanut brittle pieces over cake and serve.

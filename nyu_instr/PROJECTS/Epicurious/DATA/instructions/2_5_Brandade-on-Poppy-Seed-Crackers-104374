Rinse cod well to remove external salt. Cover with cold water by 2 inches in a bowl and soak, chilled, changing water 3 times, about 24 hours.
Peel potato and cut into 1-inch pieces. Put in a 2-quart saucepan with salted water to cover by 1 inch. Bring to a boil and simmer potato until very tender, about 15 minutes. (Do not drain until ready to whip.)
While potato is cooking, bring cream to a simmer with garlic, bay leaf, thyme, and clove in a very small heavy saucepan, then simmer gently, partially covered, until garlic is tender, about 15 minutes. Discard bay leaf, thyme, and clove and purée garlic with cream in a blender until smooth.
Meanwhile, drain cod and transfer to another 2-quart saucepan with water to cover. Bring just to a simmer and remove from heat. (Cod will just flake; do not boil or it will become tough.)
Drain cod and potatoes in a colander and, while still warm, combine in a large bowl with cream mixture. Beat with an electric mixer at low speed until combined well. Add oil in a slow stream, beating, and season with salt and white pepper. Top crackers with warm brandade just before serving.

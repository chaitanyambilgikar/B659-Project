Cook pasta 2 minutes less than the package indicates. Drain; set aside. Mix cornstarch, milk, vinegar, salt and 1/2 cup water in a bowl; set aside. Coat a large skillet with cooking spray. Add oil and warm on high heat. Sauté chicken and garlic until chicken begins to brown, 2 or 3 minutes. Add tomatoes, asparagus and mushrooms. Cook 2 or 3 more minutes, until chicken is no longer pink in center and vegetables begin to soften. Reduce heat to low and stir in pasta and cornstarch mixture. Cook 1 or 2 minutes until sauce begins to thicken. Sprinkle with cheese and serve immediately.

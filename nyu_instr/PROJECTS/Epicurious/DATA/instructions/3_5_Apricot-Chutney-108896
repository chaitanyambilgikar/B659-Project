Cook garlic and ginger in oil in a 1- to 1 1/2-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat, stirring, until golden, 1 to 2 minutes. Add mustard seeds and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add remaining ingredients and simmer, partially covered, stirring occasionally, until almost all liquid is absorbed, about 20 minutes (chutney should be moist). Cool to room temperature.

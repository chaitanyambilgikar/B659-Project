Melt butter in a saucepan over moderate heat, then whisk in flour and cook roux, stirring, until pale golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Add stock in a fast stream, whisking constantly to prevent lumps, and bring to a boil, whisking. Reduce heat and simmer, whisking frequently, until thickened to desired consistency, 6 to 8 minutes. Stir in cream, salt, and pepper.

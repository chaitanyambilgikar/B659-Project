Cut each chicken wing in half at joint. Mix oil, cilantro, soy sauce, 2 tablespoons garlic, ginger and 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper in large bowl. Add chicken wings and turn to coat. Cover and refrigerate 2 hours.
Preheat oven to 400°F. Using tongs, transfer chicken wings to large baking sheet. Bake until cooked through and golden brown, about 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine vinegar, sugar, water, chili-garlic sauce, remaining 1/2 tablespoon garlic and remaining 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper in medium saucepan. Bring to boil; reduce heat and simmer until glaze mixture thickens to syrup consistency, about 20 minutes.
Transfer baked chicken wings to large bowl. Pour glaze over; toss to coat. Place chicken wings atop steamed white rice. Sprinkle with green onions.

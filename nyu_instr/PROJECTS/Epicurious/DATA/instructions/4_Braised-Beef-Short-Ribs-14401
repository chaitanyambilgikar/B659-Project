Preheat oven to 350°F. Dredge ribs in flour, knocking off excess. Heat bacon fat in a 6-quart heavy ovenproof kettle over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and brown short ribs in batches (in a single layer without crowding). Transfer short ribs as browned with tongs to a large plate.
Pour off all but about 2 tablespoons bacon fat remaining in kettle and in it cook garlic, onions, carrots, and rosemary with salt and pepper to taste over moderate heat, stirring, until browned lightly. Add broth to vegetable mixture and bring to a boil, stirring.
Return ribs to kettle, squeezing them to fit in a single layer, if possible, and cover kettle with a led. Braise ribs in oven until tender, about 2 hours.
Transfer ribs with tongs to a platter and keep warm. Pour cooking liquid through a fine sieve set over a saucepan, discarding solids, and skim fat. If necessary, boil liquid to thicken it slightly, and spoon sauce over ribs.

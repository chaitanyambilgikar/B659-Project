Sprinkle scallops with salt, pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon thyme; add to reserved skillet and cook until just opaque in center, about 1 1/2 minutes per side. Transfer scallops to plate. Add shallots, hazelnuts, and remaining 1 teaspoon thyme to skillet; stir 30 seconds. Remove skillet from heat. Add browned butter and vinegar; stir to blend. Season vinaigrette with salt and pepper.

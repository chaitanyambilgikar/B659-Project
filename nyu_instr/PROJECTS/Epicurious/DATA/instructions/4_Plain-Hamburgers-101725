If you are serving hamburgers on buns, make two patties of 1/4 pound each for each person.The less you handle the raw meat, the juicier the cooked hamburger will be, so form the patties gently, with a light touch.
Brush with melted butter or oil. Sear them well on both sides and then continue grilling, turning often, until they are as well done as you like them. Personally, I feel they should be crusty brown on the outside, but still juicy and rare in the middle. Season with salt and pepper as you turn.
Serve on hot toasted buns, or hot toasted French bread with a choice of good relishes and pickles. Don't forget the mustard (a sharp English type or one of the excellent French imports) and freshly grated horseradish for those who prefer something hot instead of the customary pickle condiments.

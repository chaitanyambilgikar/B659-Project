Line large baking sheet with plastic wrap. Coarsely grind fish in processor. Add next 8 ingredients; blend well. Add matzo meal and egg; process until smooth, scraping down sides of bowl occasionally. With moistened hands and using 1 generous tablespoon for each cake, shape mixture into patties about 13/4 inches in diameter and 1/2 inch thick; arrange on sheet.
Heat 3 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Fry fish cakes in batches until brown and cooked through, adding more oil to skillet by tablespoonfuls as needed, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer cakes to unlined baking sheet. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Refrigerate until cold, then cover with foil and keep refrigerated. Rewarm uncovered in 350°F oven about 10 minutes.)
Arrange fish cakes on plates. Spoon aioli alongside and serve

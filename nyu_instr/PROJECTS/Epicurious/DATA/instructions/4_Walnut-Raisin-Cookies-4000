Place raisins in medium bowl. Pour enough boiling water over to cover; let stand 1 minute. Drain raisins well. Sift flour and baking powder into another medium bowl. Beat sugar and butter in large bowl until creamy. Beat in vanilla. Beat in 1 egg, then 1/3 of dry ingredients. Repeat with remaining eggs and dry ingredients in 2 batches. Stir in raisins (dough will be very soft). Chill dough 1 hour to firm slightly.
Preheat oven to 375°F. Line 3 heavy large baking sheets with foil. Butter foil. Coarsely grind walnuts in processor. Mound ground walnuts on work surface. Working in batches, drop dough by scant tablespoonfuls onto walnuts (dough will be sticky). Using hands, roll dough in ground walnuts, coating completely and forming balls. Transfer to prepared baking sheets, spacing 2 inches apart.
Bake until cookies spread and are golden brown, about 14 minutes. Transfer to racks; cool completely. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Store in airtight container.)

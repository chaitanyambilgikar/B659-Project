Whisk oil and vinegar to blend in small bowl. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and let stand at room temperature.)
Boil beets in medium pot of salted water until tender, about 30 minutes. Cool beets slightly. Peel beets and cut into 1/2-inch cubes.
Meanwhile, arrange endive on platter. Cut 1 tomato into 8 wedges and space evenly around edge of salad. Cut remaining tomato into 1/2-inch cubes. Mound tomato cubes and beet cubes in center of endive. Sprinkle capers, then grated eggs over center. Spoon enough dressing over salad to coat well.

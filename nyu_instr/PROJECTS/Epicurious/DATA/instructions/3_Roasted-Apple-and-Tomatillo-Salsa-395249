1 Preheat the oven to 375°F.
2 Put the tomatillos, 2 of the apples, the onion, garlic, and jalapeño chile on a rimmed baking sheet. Toss with the olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Roast until tomatillos are softened and slightly charred, about 20 minutes.
3 Peel the garlic, then transfer all of the ingredients to a blender and puree until smooth. Season with salt and pepper.
4 Chop the remaining apple into 1/4-inch cubes and stir into the salsa before serving.

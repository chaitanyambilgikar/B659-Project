For filling: Mix all ingredients in medium bowl to blend.
For frittata: Whisk eggs, parsley, salt, and pepper in another medium bowl until frothy. Heat 1 teaspoon oil in 8-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1/3 of egg mixture (scant 1/4 cup) to skillet, swirling pan to coat bottom evenly in very thin layer. Cook until eggs are set and lightly browned on bottom, about 45 seconds. Turn frittata over and cook until set and slightly golden, about 30 seconds. Transfer to plate. Repeat with remaining egg mixture and oil for a total of 3 frittatas.
Place frittatas on work surface. Divide ricotta filling among frittatas, spreading out to edges. Roll up each frittata jelly-roll style. Wrap frittatas individually in plastic. Chill overnight. Unwrap frittatas. Cut on diagonal into 3/4-inch-thick slices. Serve chilled or at room temperature.

Beat cheese, butter and 1 tablespoon marjoram in small bowl to blend. Season Gorgonzola butter with salt and pepper. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover; chill.)
Combine oil, garlic and 2 tablespoons marjoram in large glass baking dish. Add steaks and all peppers; sprinkle with black pepper. Turn to coat. Let stand 2 hours at room temperature or chill up to 6 hours, turning occasionally.
Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Place steaks and peppers on grill; sprinkle with salt. Grill steaks about 5 minutes per side for medium-rare, and peppers until tender, turning occasionally, about 10 minutes.
Transfer steaks to platter; surround with peppers. Top each steak with 1/4 of Gorgonzola butter. Let stand just until butter softens, about 5 minutes.

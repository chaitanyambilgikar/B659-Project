Preheat the oven to 350°F. and butter and flour two 8-inch round cake pans. In a food processor grind fine the hazelnuts with the flour and the sugar, add the butter, and blend the mixture until it is combined well. Press half the dough evenly onto the bottom of each of the pans, cut through each round of dough with a small knife to score 16 wedges, and bake the shortbread in the middle of the oven for 20 minutes, or until it is pale golden. While the shortbread is still warm, cut through the rounds again and let them cool in the pans on a rack. Choose 2 plates slightly smaller than the pans, put a plate directly on the surface of the shortbread, and invert the shortbread carefully onto it.
In a metal bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water melt the chocolate with the shortening, stirring until the mixture is smooth, and transfer the mixture to a deep narrow cup or glass measure. Dip the points of the shortbread wedges into the chocolate mixture, coating them halfway and letting any excess drip off. Transfer the shortbread wedges as they are dipped to rack set over a sheet of wax paper and let them stand until the chocolate is set.

In a skillet sauté the zucchini in the butter over moderately high heat, stirring occasionally, for 3 minutes, or until it is just tender. Add the tomatoes, cook the mixture, shaking the skillet, for 1 minute, or until the tomatoes are heated through, and stir in the mint and salt and pepper to taste.

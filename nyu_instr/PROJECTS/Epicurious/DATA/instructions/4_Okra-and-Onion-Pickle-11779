In a kettle of boiling salted water blanch the okra for 2 minutes, or until it is crisp-tender, drain it, and plunge it into a bowl of ice and cold water to stop the cooking. Drain the okra and pat it dry between layers of paper towels. In a bowl whisk together the vinegar and the sugar until the sugar is dissolved, whisk in the oil and salted and pepper to taste, and toss the okra and the onion with the dressing. The okra and onion pickle may be made 1 hour in advance and kept covered and chilled. (Alternatively the okra and onion pickle may be made 1 day in advance and kept covered and chilled, but the okra will discolor.)

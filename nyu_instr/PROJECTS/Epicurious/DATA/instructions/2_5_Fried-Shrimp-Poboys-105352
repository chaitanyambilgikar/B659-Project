Combine shrimp, breadcrumbs, egg, egg yolk, parsley, cracker meal, garlic, and cayenne pepper in processor. Using on/off turns, process until shrimp are finely chopped but not pasty. Form mixture into 24 balls, using 2 tablespoonfuls for each. Roll balls in cracker meal.
Pour vegetable oil to depth of 3 inches in heavy large pot. Heat oil to 325°F. Working in batches, fry shrimp balls until golden brown, turning occasionally, about 5 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer shrimp balls to paper towels and drain.
Place 3 shrimp balls on bottom half of each roll. Top with tartar sauce, lettuce, and tomato, then roll tops. Serve immediately, passing hot sauce separately.

For biscuits: Preheat oven to 400°F. Mix flour, sugar, baking powder, lemon peel and salt in large bowl. Whisk buttermilk and melted butter in medium bowl to blend. Add to flour mixture and stir just until moist dough forms. Drop 8 dough mounds (about 1/3 cup each) onto nonstick baking sheet. Using lightly floured hands, gently pat biscuits into neat 2 1/4-inch-diameter round about 1 1/4 inches high. Bake until biscuits are golden brown, about 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, prepare topping: Slice 2 baskets strawberries; transfer to large bowl. Puree remaining 1 basket strawberries in processor until smooth. Add to sliced strawberries. Stir in mint, sugar and lemon juice.
Cut warm biscuits in half horizontally. Place bottom halves of biscuits on 8 plates. Spoon topping generously over, allowing some berries and juices to spill onto plates. Place top halves of biscuits over and serve.

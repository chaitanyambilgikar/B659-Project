Dip the chicken pieces in the egg mixture, then coat with the corn flake mixture, patting with your fingers to make the crumbs adhere. The chicken can be prepared to this point up to 3 hours in advance and kept, uncovered, in the refrigerator. Arrange the chicken skin side up on the baking sheet. If you wish, drizzle over the chicken:
2 to 3 tablespoons melted butter
Bake until the chicken is crisp and golden, 45 to 60 minutes. Serve immediately or at room temperature.

Sauté bacon in large pot over medium heat until crisp and brown. Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towels and drain. Discard all but 2 tablespoons drippings from pot. Add shallots and garlic to drippings. Sauté over medium-high heat until tender, about 2 minutes. Add kale and broth. Cover and cook until kale wilts and is almost tender, stirring occasionally, about 12 minutes. Uncover and cook until kale is tender and most of broth has cooked away, stirring occasionally, about 12 minutes longer. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer kale to bowl. Sprinkle with bacon and serve.

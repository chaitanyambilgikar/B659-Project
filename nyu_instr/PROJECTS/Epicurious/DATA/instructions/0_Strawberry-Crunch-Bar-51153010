PREHEAT the oven to 350° F. Line an 8" by 8" baking sheet or cake pan with parchment paper, lightly grease with vegetable cooking spray, and set aside.
COMBINE the flour, oats, sugar, and cinnamon in a large bowl and stir well. Add the butter and applesauce, and mix until slightly wet crumbs form.
PRESS two-thirds of the oats mixture into the prepared pan, pressing to a uniform half-inch thickness. Spread the jam over the top layer, using a small offset spatula or the back of a spoon to evenly spread onto the oats. Crumble the remaining oats mixture over the jam to form a uniform thickness. Bake until the top is golden brown, 30 minutes.
REMOVE from the oven and place on a wire rack to cool completely before cutting.
CUT the cooled cake into bars measuring 1 1/2" by 1 1/4" and serve immediately, or wrap individually in plastic wrap. (The bars will keep at room temperature for up to two days, and refrigerate for up to four days.)

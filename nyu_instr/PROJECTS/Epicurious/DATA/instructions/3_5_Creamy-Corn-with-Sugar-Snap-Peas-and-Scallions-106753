Cook sugar snaps in 6 batches in an 8-quart pot of boiling salted water until crisp-tender, about 1 minute (return to a boil between batches). Transfer with a slotted spoon to a large bowl of ice and cold water to stop cooking. Drain sugar snaps and pat dry with paper towels.
Cook corn in 2 batches in same pot of boiling water until just tender, about 3 minutes (return to a boil between batches). Transfer to bowl of ice and cold water to stop cooking. Drain corn and pat dry with paper towels. Cut off kernels and discard cobs.
Just before serving, boil cream and scallions in a wide 6- to 8-quart heavy pot over high heat until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes. Add sugar snaps, corn, salt, and pepper and cook, tossing, until vegetables are coated and heated through, about 2 minutes.

Preheat oven to 350°F. Roast nuts in a shallow baking pan in middle of oven until toasted, 10 to 12 minutes. Wrap in a kitchen towel and rub to remove skins from nuts (not all skins will come off). Cool nuts and coarsely chop. Rub a large salad bowl with cut sides of garlic, then discard garlic and add nuts to bowl.
Prepare grill for cooking or preheat broiler.
Thread mushrooms horizontally through caps onto skewers and arrange on a baking sheet. Whisk together vinegar and salt in a small bowl, then gradually whisk in olive oil until emulsified. Add pepper to taste.
Brush a few tablespoons vinaigrette onto mushrooms and grill 4 to 6 inches over glowing coals, turning once, until mushrooms are golden and tender, 3 to 5 minutes. (Alternatively, mushrooms can be broiled.)
Working quickly, remove mushrooms from skewers and slice 1/4 inch thick. Add to salad bowl with frisée, remaining vinaigrette, hazelnut oil, and salt and pepper to taste and toss well.

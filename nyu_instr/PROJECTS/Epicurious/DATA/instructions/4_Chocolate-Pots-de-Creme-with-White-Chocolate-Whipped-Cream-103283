Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 325°F. Arrange six 3/4-cup custard cups or souffle dishes in roasting pan. Combine whipping cream, chopped semisweet chocolate and instant espresso powder in heavy medium saucepan. Bring almost to simmer over medium heat, whisking until chocolate melts and mixture is smooth. Whisk egg yolks and sugar in large bowl to blend. Gradually whisk in hot cream mixture.
Divide custard equally among cups. Pour enough hot water into pan to come halfway up sides of cups. Bake custards until just set around edges but still soft in center, about 25 minutes. Remove cups from water. Refrigerate uncovered until cold, at least 2 hours. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and keep refrigerated.) Spoon White Chocolate Whipped Cream atop custards and serve.

Drain pineapple thoroughly in sieve set over large measuring cup. Add enough water to juices in cup to measure 2 cups liquid. Place liquid in large non-aluminum saucepan. Add cranberries and sugar. Stir over high heat until sugar dissolves and mixture comes to boil. Continue to boil until most berries pop open and mixture is thick, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat. Mix in drained pineapple, walnuts, lemon juice and cloves. Transfer to bowl and refrigerate uncovered until cold, about 2 hours; cover. (Can be prepared 2 weeks ahead. Keep refrigerated.)

Cut zucchini crosswise into 1/8-inch-thick slices and in a colander toss with salt. Let zucchini stand to drain 45 minutes. Pat zucchini dry.
While zucchini is draining, cut basil into thin strips and bring a 6-quart pasta pot three fourths full with salted water to a boil for farfalle. Cook pasta in boiling water until al dente and ladle out and reserve 1 cup pasta cooking water. Drain pasta in colander.
While pasta is cooking, in a deep 12-inch heavy skillet heat oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and sauté zucchini, stirring occasionally, until golden and tender, about 7 minutes. Reduce heat to low and stir in half of basil. Stir in pasta and butter and gently toss until butter is melted. Stir in 1/2 cup reserved pasta water and gently toss (adding more pasta water as needed if mixture becomes too dry). Stir in 1/2 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano, remaining basil, and salt and pepper to taste.
Serve pasta with additional cheese.

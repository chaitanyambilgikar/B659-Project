Position rack in center of oven; preheat to 400°F. Place onions on rimmed baking sheet. Open onion wedges to resemble flowers but do not break off base. Melt butter in small saucepan over low heat. Whisk in rosemary, parsley, and lemon juice. Season herb butter with salt and pepper. Brush some butter over onions. Roast onions until tender and beginning to char, brushing occasionally with more herb butter, about 1 hour. Serve warm.

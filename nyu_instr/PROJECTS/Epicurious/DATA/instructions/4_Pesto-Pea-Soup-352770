Simmer onion, carrot, and celery in broth and water with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a medium saucepan, covered, until tender, about 6 minutes. Add peas and simmer, uncovered, until bright green and tender, about 3 minutes. Stir in pesto, then purée soup in 2 batches in a blender until smooth (use caution when blending hot liquids). Season with salt.

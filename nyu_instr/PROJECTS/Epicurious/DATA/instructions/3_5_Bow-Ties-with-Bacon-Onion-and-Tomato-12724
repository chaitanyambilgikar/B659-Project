In a deep skillet cook the bacon over moderate heat, stirring, until it is crisp and transfer it with a slotted spoon to a bowl. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon of fat from the skillet, add the oil, and in the fat cook the onion over moderate heat, stirring, until it is golden brown. In a kettle of salted boiling water cook the pasta until it is al dente. While the pasta is cooking, stir the tomato into the onion mixture with the 1/4 cup water, the red pepper flakes, and salt to taste, simmer the sauce, stirring, for 5 minutes, and stir in the parsley and the bacon. Drain the pasta well, add it to the sauce, and toss it well. Add the Parmesan and toss the pasta well.

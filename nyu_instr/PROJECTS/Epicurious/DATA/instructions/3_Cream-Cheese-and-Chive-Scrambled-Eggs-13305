In a bowl whisk together the eggs, the cream cheese, 2 tablespoons of the chives, and salt and pepper to taste. In a large heavy skillet melt the butter over moderate heat, add the egg mixture, and cook it, stirring, for 6 to 8 minutes, or until the eggs are cooked through. Serve the eggs sprinkled with the additional chives.

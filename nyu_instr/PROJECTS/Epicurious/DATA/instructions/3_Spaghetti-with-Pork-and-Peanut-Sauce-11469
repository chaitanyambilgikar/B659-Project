In a heavy skillet cook the pork in the oil over moderate heat, stirring and breaking up the lumps, until it is no longer pink, add 2 teaspoons of the sugar, the garlic, the gingerroot, and 1 tablespoon of the soy sauce, and sauté the mixture over high heat until the pork is browned. In a blender blend together the remaining 3 tablespoons soy sauce, the lemon juice, the sesame oil, the remaining 2 teaspoons sugar, and the peanut butter and add enough of the hot water to thin the sauce to the desired consistency.
in a kettle of boiling salted water boil the spaghetti until it is al dente, drain it well, and in a large bowl toss it with the pork mixture, the peanut sauce, the scallion greens, and salt and pepper to taste.

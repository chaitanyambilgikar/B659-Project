Preheat oven to 350°F. Spray 9-inch round cake pan with 1 1/2-inch-high sides with vegetable oil spray. Line bottom of pan with parchment. Sift flour, 3/4 cup sugar, cocoa powder, ginger, baking soda, cinnamon and salt into large bowl. Whisk juice, oil and vinegar in medium bowl to blend. Add to dry ingredients; stir just until moistened. Spoon batter into prepared pan. Using spatula, smooth top.

Using knife, cut around sides of pan to loosen cake. Turn cake out onto platter. Turn cake right side up. Sift powdered sugar over top. Cut into wedges.

1. Put half the shrimp in a food processor and pulse until finely chopped.
2. Add the rest and pulse a few more times (half the mixture will serve as a binding paste; the rest will remain roughly chopped).
3. Transfer to a bowl and add the scallions, soy sauce, and ginger, then mix by hand until well combined.
4. Drain the rice and spread it on a plate. Form the shrimp mixture into 1 1/2-inch balls. Roll each in the rice.
5. Line a steamer basket with the leaves. Add the meatballs and steam until the rice is cooked and the shrimp is pink, 8 to 9 minutes. Serve with the ponzu or soy sauce.

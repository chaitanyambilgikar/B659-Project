Mix first 6 ingredients in 13x9x2-inch glass baking dish. Add steak and turn to coat. Marinate 1 hour at room temperature or refrigerate up to 6 hours, turning steak occasionally.
Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat) or preheat broiler. Drain marinade into small saucepan; boil 1 minute and reserve to pass as sauce. Grill or broil steak to desired doneness, about 4 minutes per side for medium-rare.
Transfer steak to platter. Thinly slice across grain. Serve with marinade.

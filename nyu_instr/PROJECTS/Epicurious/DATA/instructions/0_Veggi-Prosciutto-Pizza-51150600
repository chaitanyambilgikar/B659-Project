Heat oven to 400°F. Roll dough into a 10-inch disk; transfer to a pizza pan. Spread sauce evenly across dough. Sprinkle mozzarella, mushrooms, spinach, artichoke hearts and prosciutto evenly over pizza; top with Parmesan. Drizzle with oil and sprinkle with red pepper. Bake until crust is light brown and cheese is bubbly, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool 5 minutes; cut into 6 slices and serve.

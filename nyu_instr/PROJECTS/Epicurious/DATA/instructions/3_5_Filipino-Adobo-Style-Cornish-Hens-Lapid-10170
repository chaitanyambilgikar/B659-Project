In a bowl stir together soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, oregano, bay leaves, and salt and pepper to taste. Put hens in a large sealable plastic bag and pour soy sauce mixture over them. Seal bag, pressing out extra air, and put in a bowl or shallow dish. Marinate hens, chilled, turning bag once or twice, at least 2 hours and up to 12.
Preheat oven to 450.
Arrange hens, skin side up, in a baking pan, 13 by 9 by 2 inches, and pour marinade around them. Bake hens in middle of oven 20 to 25 minutes, or until just cooked through.
Discard bay leaves and serve Cornish hens with rice.

Preheat oven to 450°F. Bring broth to boil in heavy large saucepan. Add asparagus; cover and boil until asparagus is very tender, about 8 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer asparagus to cutting board; reserve broth. Cut tips from asparagus and reserve. Coarsely chop remaining asparagus; transfer to processor. Add 1/2 cup reserved asparagus cooking broth and olive oil and puree until smooth, adding more cooking broth if sauce is too thick (discard any remaining broth). Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper. Return to same saucepan.
Spray baking sheet with vegetable oil spray. Place fish on prepared sheet. Drizzle lemon juice over fish. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Bake fish until just opaque in center, about 10 minutes.
Rewarm sauce over medium-low heat. Divide sauce among 4 plates. Top with fish. Garnish with reserved asparagus tips and roasted red pepper strips. Serve immediately.

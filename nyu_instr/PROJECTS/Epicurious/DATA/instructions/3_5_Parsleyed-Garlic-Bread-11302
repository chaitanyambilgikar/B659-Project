In a small food processor or a blender puree the garlic with the salt, the butter, and the oil until the mixture is smooth, transfer the mixture to a small bowl, and stir in the parsley. Cut each baguette crosswise with a serrated knife into 1-inch sections without cutting all the way through to the bottom, spread some of the garlic mixture in each cut, and spread the remaining mixture on the tops of the baguettes. Wrap each baguette loosely in foil and bake the bread in a preheated 375°F. oven for 10 minutes. Open the foil to expose the tops of the baguettes and bake the bread for 5 minutes more, or until it is hot and crusty.

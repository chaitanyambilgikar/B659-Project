Preheat oven to 400 °F. Arrange pears, cut side up, in 8x8x2-inch glass baking dish; add fennel. Drizzle olive oil and chicken broth over pears and fennel. Roast 10 minutes. Turn pears and fennel over and roast until pears are just tender, about 5 minutes longer. Using slotted spoon, transfer pears to plate. Continue roasting fennel until tender, about 15 minutes longer. Transfer fennel to plate with pears, reserving any cooking liquid. Thinly slice fennel and 2 pear halves lengthwise. Cool completely.
Peel remaining 2 pear halves. Transfer peeled pears to processor. Add reserved cooking liquid and vinegar to processor and blend until very smooth. Season dressing with salt and pepper.
Divide greens among 4 plates. Top with fennel and pear slices. Drizzle some dressing over each salad. Serve, passing remaining dressing separately.

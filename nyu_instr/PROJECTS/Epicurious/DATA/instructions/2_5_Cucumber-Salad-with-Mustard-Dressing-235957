Whisk the half-and-half, yogurt, mustard, salt, pepper, and dill in a large bowl until creamy. Taste for mustard and add a bit more, if needed; there should be a distinct mustard flavor, but take care not to add so much that you overpower the flavor of the cucumbers. Add the cucumbers to the bowl and toss well to mix. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 4 hours before serving, or better yet, chill overnight.

1. Preheat oven to 425°F.
2. Heat the oil in a large ovenproof sauté pan over medium heat. Add the leek and sauté until soft, then add the peas and cook for 2 to 3 minutes more.
3. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, beat the eggs with 1 tablespoon water.
4. Add the eggs and half the mint to the pan, season with the salt and pepper, and cook, lifting the edges with a spatula to allow the uncooked eggs to flow to the bottom. When the frittata is partly cooked (7 to 10 minutes), sprinkle on the ricotta and transfer the pan to the oven.
5. Bake until puffed, golden, and set, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove and allow to cool slightly. Garnish with the remaining mint to taste and serve.

Sift flour, cornstarch, baking powder and salt into medium bowl. Using electric mixer, beat butter, sugar, vanilla extract and orange peel in large bowl until fluffy. Add flour mixture and beat just until moist clumps form. Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk. Wrap and refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour and up to 1 day.
Preheat oven to 325°F. Line large baking sheet with parchment paper. Roll out dough on lightly floured surface to 1/4-inch-thick round. Using 3- to 3 1/4-inch cutter, cut out cookies. Transfer cookies to prepared baking sheet. Gather dough and reroll to 1/4-inch thickness; cut out more cookies. Bake until cookies are light brown at edges, about 15 minutes. Cool on sheet. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.)
Whisk 1/2 cup currant jelly in small saucepan over low heat until melted and smooth. Place 8 shortbread cookies on plates; brush generously with currant jelly (reserve remaining cookies for another use).

Brush bottom of more strawberries with currant jelly and arrange around center strawberry. Brush top of all strawberries with currant jelly to glaze. Repeat with remaining cookies and strawberries. (Can be prepared 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.)

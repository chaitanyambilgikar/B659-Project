In a large saucepan of boiling salted water boil snow peas 30 seconds and drain. Refresh snow peas under cold water and drain. Snow peas may be prepared up to this point 8 hours ahead and chilled, covered.
In a heavy skillet sauté snow peas in oil over moderately high heat, until heated through and season with salt and pepper.

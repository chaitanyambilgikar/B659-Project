Place vinegar and saffron in heavy large pot over low heat. Cook 1 minute to blend flavors. Remove from heat; let cool. Whisk in olive oil. Season vinaigrette to taste with salt and pepper.
Preheat broiler. Add clams, tomatoes, shallots and 1 tablespoon chopped garlic to vinaigrette in pot. Cover and cook over high heat until clams open, about 8 minutes (discard any clams that do not open). Remove pot from heat. Using tongs, arrange clams in large serving bowl. Add lemon juice to saffron-tomato broth in pot.
Meanwhile, brush sourdough bread slices lightly with olive oil. Rub bread with remaining 2 teaspoons garlic. Broil bread until golden, about 2 minutes.
Sprinkle clams with chopped parsley. Pour saffron-tomato broth over clams. Garnish with sourdough toasts and lemon wedges and serve.

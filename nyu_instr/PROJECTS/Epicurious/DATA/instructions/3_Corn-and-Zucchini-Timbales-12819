In a blender purée the corn with 2/3 cup water for 1 minute, add the eggs, the flour, the sugar, and the salt, and purée the mixture for 1 minute. Strain the purée through a fine sieve into a bowl, pressing hard on the solids. With a vegetable peeler cut 16 thin lengthwise slices from the zucchini, avoiding the cores, and grate enough of the remaining zucchini to measure 1 cup. Squeeze the grated zucchini dry in a kitchen towel and stir it into the corn mixture with the thyme.
Arrange 2 zucchini slices decoratively in each of 8 buttered 1/2-cup timbale molds, pressing the slices firmly against the sides of the molds and trimming the ends, and divide the corn mixture among the molds. Arrange the molds in a baking dish, add enough hot water to the dish to come halfway up their sides, and bake the timbales in the middle of a preheated 350°F. oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until they are firm. Transfer the molds to a work surface and let them stand for 3 minutes. Run a thin knife around the edge of each mold and invert the timbales onto platters. (The timbales may be made 1 day in advance and kept covered and chilled. Reheat the timbales in a baking dish, covered tightly with foil, in a preheated 350°F. oven for 15 minutes.)

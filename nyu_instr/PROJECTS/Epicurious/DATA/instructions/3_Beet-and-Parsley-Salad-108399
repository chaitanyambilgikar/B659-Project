Trim and peel raw beets, then cut into very thin slices (1/16 inch thick) with slicer. Make small stacks of slices and cut each stack with a sharp knife into very thin strips (1/16 inch thick).
Toss beets with parsley, salt, sugar, and pepper in a serving bowl until sugar is dissolved. Add oil and toss to coat. Sprinkle vinegar on salad and toss again. Serve immediately.

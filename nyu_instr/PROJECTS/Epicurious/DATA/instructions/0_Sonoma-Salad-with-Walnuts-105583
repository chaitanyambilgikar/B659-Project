Boil stock in a small saucepan until reduced to about 1 tablespoon. Whisk in duck fat, garlic, and mustard, then stir in vinegar, oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper (do not emulsify or dressing will weigh down greens).
ust before serving, toss greens and herbs with remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a salad bowl. Add walnuts and drizzle some of dressing around side of salad bowl, then toss gently. If necessary, add more dressing in same manner to just coat.

Place all the marinade ingredients in the bowl of a food processor and process until pureed. Pour the marinade into a plastic food bag, and add the trimmed pork fillet. Seal the bag tightly, and shake it until the meat is well coated with the marinade. Refrigerate for at least 2 and up to 8 hours.
About 30 minutes before cooking time, heat a grill until it is hot. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees.
Remove the pork fillet from the marinade, and reserve the marinade in an ovenproof skillet or metal gratin dish. Sprinkle the fillet with the oil, and place it on the hot grill. Cook, covered, about 6 minutes, then turn the fillet over. Cook, covered, for 6 minutes on the second side, until the meat is nicely grilled on all sides.
Bring the reserved marinade to a boil on top of the stove. Return the meat to the marinade and place it in the 200-degree oven for at least 10 minutes but as long as 40 minutes to rest. Slice the fillet, and serve with some of the juices.

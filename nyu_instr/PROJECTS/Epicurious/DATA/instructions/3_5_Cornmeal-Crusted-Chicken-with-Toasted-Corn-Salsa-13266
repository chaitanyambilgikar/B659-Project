In a non-stick skillet heat remaining tablespoon oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and sauté corn, stirring, until deep golden, about 4 minutes. Add corn and remaining salsa ingredients to bowl and toss to combine well. (Beets may bleed slightly, coloring other ingredients.)

In skillet heat butter over moderately high heat until foam subsides and sauté chicken until golden and cooked through, about 5 minutes on each side.

Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium heat. Add onions and sauté until golden, about 15 minutes. Add ginger and garlic; sauté 1 minute. Add curry, cumin and cinnamon; sauté until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add flour, then yogurt and tomato paste, whisking until sauce is smooth, about 1 minute. Add broth and applesauce. Bring to boil. Reduce heat; simmer until sauce thickens slightly, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cool slightly. Cover and chill. Bring to simmer before continuing.)
Add chicken and peas to sauce. Simmer until chicken is almost cooked through, about 3 minutes. Add sour cream and coconut milk. Reduce heat to medium-low. Stir until chicken is cooked through and sauce thickens enough to coat spoon, about 3 minutes (do not boil). Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to bowl. Garnish with cilantro sprigs.
Place rice, chutney, bananas, mangoes, coconut and peanuts in separate bowls. Serve alongside curry.

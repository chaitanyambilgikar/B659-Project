In a large heavy saucepan simmer peas, basil, and bay leaf in water and broth, covered partially, until peas are tender, about 35 minutes, and discard bay leaf.
While peas are cooking, in a heavy skillet sauté onion and cuminseed in oil over moderately high heat, stirring, until golden brown.
In a blender puree soup in batches until just smooth and transfer to a bowl. Stir in onion mixture and salt and pepper to taste.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line a baking sheet with unbleached parchment paper or a silicone baking sheet.
Whisk together flours, baking powder and salt. Combine oil, almond meal, erythritol and syrup in a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring, until well combined and smooth, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and whisk in almond extract.
Stir almond mixture into dry ingredients and mix well. Add almond milk and mix to create a soft, sticky dough. With wet hands, form dough into 1 1/2-inch balls. Place pignoli in a shallow dish and roll each cookie around, covering with pignoli. Arrange on baking sheet, allowing space for cookies to spread slightly. Bake for 18 minutes. The cookies will still be soft when they come out of the oven. Immediately remove from baking sheet and transfer to a cooling rack.

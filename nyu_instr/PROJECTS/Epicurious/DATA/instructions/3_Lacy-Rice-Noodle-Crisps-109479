Soak noodles in cold water in a large bowl until very pliable, 15 to 20 minutes, then drain and pat dry. Spread noodles on several layers of paper towels and air-dry 30 minutes.
Separate noodles into 1-tablespoon mounds, then gently pull each mound apart so it forms a loose tangle, about 3 1/2 inches in diameter.
Heat 1 1/2 inches oil in a wide 4-quart heavy pot over moderately high heat until it registers 350°F on thermometer. Carefully drop (by hand) 2 noodle tangles about 2 inches apart into oil (noodles will sink to bottom and oil will immediately bubble up, then noodles will expand and rise to top) and fry until crisp, about 20 seconds (noodles will not turn golden). Transfer with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain and immediately dust generously with confectioners sugar and season with salt. Fry remaining noodles, 2 tangles at a time, in same manner and dust with sugar and sprinkle with salt.

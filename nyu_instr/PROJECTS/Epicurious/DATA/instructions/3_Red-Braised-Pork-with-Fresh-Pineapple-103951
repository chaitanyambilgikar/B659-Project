In a carbon-steel, stainless-steel, or coated aluminum wok, heat the oil over high heat until just smoking. Add the pork in three batches and brown on all sides. Remove the meat to a plate. Add the ginger and scallions, and stir-fry for 30 seconds. Return the pork to the pan. Reduce the heat to medium and add the tangerine peel, five-spice powder, sherry, soy sauce, sugar, and water.
Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low, then cover and simmer for 30 minutes. The dish may be prepared up to this point and frozen. Add the pineapple chunks and continue cooking for another 15 to 20 minutes, until the meat is tender when pricked with a fork. Using a slotted spoon, remove the pork and pineapple to a serving platter. Add the cornstarch mixture to the sauce, bring to a boil, and cook for 1 minute, until the sauce thickens. Pour the sauce over the pork and serve.

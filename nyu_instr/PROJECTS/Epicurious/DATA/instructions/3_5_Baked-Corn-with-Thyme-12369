In a bowl stir together the corn, the cream, the thyme, and salt and pepper or taste, spoon the mixture into a buttered 6-inch baking pan or gratin dish, and sprinkle the bread crumbs on top. Bake the corn mixture in the middle of a preheated 350°F. oven for 25 minutes, or until it is crusty around the edges. Broil the corn mixture under a preheated broiler about 4 inches from the heat for 2 minutes, or until the bread crumbs are toasted.

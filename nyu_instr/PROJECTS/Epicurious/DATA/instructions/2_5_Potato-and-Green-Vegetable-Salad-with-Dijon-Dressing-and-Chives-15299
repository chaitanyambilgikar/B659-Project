Make dressing: In a small bowl whisk together all dressing ingredients. Dressing may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.
Make salad: In a large saucepan cover potatoes with salted water by 2 inches and simmer until just tender, about 20 minutes. Drain potatoes and, when cool enough to handle, cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Diagonally slice celery and hard-boil eggs. When eggs are cool enough to handle, cut whites into 1/4-inch dice, reserving yolks for another use. Thinly slice endives crosswise and cut zucchini crosswise into 1/8-inch-thick slices. Thinly slice onion. Chop enough chives to measure 1/2 cup. Vegetables, egg whites, and chives may be prepared up to this point 4 hours ahead and chilled separately, covered. Just before serving, in a large bowl gently toss all ingredients with dressing to coat well.

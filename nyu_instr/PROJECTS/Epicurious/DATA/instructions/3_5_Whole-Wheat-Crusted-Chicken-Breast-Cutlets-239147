1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and brush the foil lightly with the olive oil. Pat the chicken breasts dry with a paper towel and season them generously with the salt and pepper.
2. In a small bowl, blend together the mustard and mayonnaise. Coat the top of each chicken breast evenly with about 1 tablespoon of the mixture.
3. Spread the bread crumbs on a shallow plate. Roll the chicken breasts in them gently, pressing down firmly to coat them evenly.
4. Transfer the chicken to the foil-lined baking sheet and bake until cooked through, 12 to 14 minutes. Adjust oven temperature to broil and cook until the crust is golden brown and crisp, 1 to 2 minutes more. For a healthy alternative to chicken fingers, serve the cutlets sliced into 2-by 4-inch pieces.

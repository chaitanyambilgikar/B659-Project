Combine 1 1/2 cups cranberry juice cocktail, honey and orange peel in heavy medium saucepan. Bring mixture to simmer over medium heat, stirring until honey dissolves. Simmer 4 minutes to blend flavors. Add cinnamon stick, bay leaf, ginger, coriander, salt, black pepper, cloves and cayenne pepper; simmer 2 minutes. Add cranberries and simmer until berries burst and sauce is thick, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat. Discard bay leaf; mix in remaining 1/4 cup cranberry juice cocktail. Refrigerate cranberry sauce until well chilled. (Can be prepared 3 days ahead. Cover and keep refrigerated.)

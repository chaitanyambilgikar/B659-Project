Make syrup: Combine all ingredients in heavy medium saucepan. Stir over medium-low heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat and boil 1 minute. Cool.
Make cake: Preheat oven to 350°F. Oil 13 x 9 x 2-inch metal baking pan. Finely grind almonds and 1/2 cup sugar in processor; transfer to medium bowl. Whisk in matzo cake meal, matzo meal, cinnamon and allspice. Using electric mixer, beat eggs and remaining 1 1/2 cups sugar in large bowl until very thick and pale in color, about 10 minutes. Beat in oil and lemon peel. Fold in almond mixture. Transfer batter to prepared pan.
Bake cake until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Cut hot cake into 32 squares; leave in pan. Drizzle cooled syrup over. Let stand until syrup is absorbed, at least 30 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Cool, cover and store at room temperature.)

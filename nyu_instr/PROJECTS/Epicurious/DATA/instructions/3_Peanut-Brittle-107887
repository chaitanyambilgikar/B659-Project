Line large baking sheet with parchment paper; butter parchment. Stir peanuts, sugar, and corn syrup in heavy large saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat to high and boil until candy thermometer registers 295°F, stirring frequently, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat. Add baking soda and stir briskly to blend (mixture will foam up). Immediately pour out onto prepared baking sheet. Spread out brittle in even layer. Let stand until cold and hard.
Break brittle into pieces. Store in airtight containers at room temperature. (Can be prepared 1 month ahead.)

Combine first 7 ingredients in heavy medium saucepan. Stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Bring to boil. Reduce heat; simmer until sauce thickens slightly and is reduced to 1 1/2 cups, stirring occasionally, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in cream. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and chill. Rewarm over low heat before serving.)

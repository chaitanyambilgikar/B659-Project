Bring cream and mint leaves to boil in medium saucepan. Remove from heat. Cover; let steep 1 hour. Strain into large bowl, pressing on leaves to release cream. Return cream to saucepan. Simmer until reduced to 1/2 cup, about 5 minutes. Add 12 ounces chopped chocolate and butter to cream. Whisk over low heat until melted and smooth. Stir in liqueur and vanilla. Freeze until firm, about 20 minutes.
Scoop up 1 tablespoon chocolate mixture. Roll between palms to form ball, then roll ball in grated chocolate. Place in candy cup. Repeat with remaining chocolate mixture and grated chocolate. Arrange truffles in airtight containers; chill. (Can be made ahead. Refrigerate up to 2 weeks, or freeze up to 1 month.) Let stand at room temperature 10 minutes before serving.

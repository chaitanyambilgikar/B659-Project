Preheat oven to 400°F. Wrap beets in foil and bake until tender when pierced with knife, about 1 hour 30 minutes. Cool slightly, then peel. Cut each beet into 8 wedges. Place in medium bowl. Cover.
Whisk oil and vinegar in small bowl. Mix in minced shallots. Pour 3 tablespoons dressing over warm beets; toss. Cool. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover beets and remaining dressing separately; refrigerate. Bring dressing to room temperature before continuing.)
Combine spinach, endive and 3/4 cup nuts in large bowl. Pour remaining dressing over; toss. Season with salt and pepper. Divide among plates. Sprinkle cheese over. Top with beets and 1/4 cup nuts.

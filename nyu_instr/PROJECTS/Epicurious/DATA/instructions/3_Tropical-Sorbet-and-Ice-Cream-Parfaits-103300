Melt butter in heavy small saucepan over medium-high heat. Whisk in brown sugar and cream; bring to boil. Add lime juice, lime peel and salt. Boil until sauce is reduced to 3/4 cup, whisking occasionally, about 2 minutes. Set caramel-lime sauce aside.
Place 1/3 cup sorbet in each of 4 parfait glasses or wineglasses. Top sorbet with 1/4 cup pineapple, 1/4 cup mango, 2 tablespoons coconut, 2 tablespoons sauce and 1/3 cup ice cream. Sprinkle each parfait with 1 tablespoon coconut and drizzle with 1 tablespoon sauce. Serve immediately.

In a large heavy skillet cook peas in butter with salt and pepper to taste over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, 3 minutes.
In a food processor puree peas with zest until smooth and cool. Stir in lemon juice. Purée may be made 2 days ahead and chilled, covered. Bring purée to room temperature before proceeding. Stir in mint and season with salt and pepper.
Halve zucchini crosswise and trim so that each half is 3 1/4 inches long. With a mandoline or other manual slicer cut zucchini pieces lengthwise into 1/8-inch-thick slices. Transfer puree to a pastry bag fitted with a 1/4-inch plain tip. Roll zucchini slices into cones and pipe some puree into each cone. Arrange cones on a tray, seam sides down. Zucchini cones may be prepared up to this point 3 hours ahead and chilled, covered with damp paper towels and plastic wrap. Bring cones to cool room temperature before serving.
Garnish hors d'oeuvres with mint leaves.

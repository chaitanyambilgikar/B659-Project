In a large bowl whisk together the vinegar, the water, the salt, the sugar, the tarragon, the garlic paste, and pepper to taste, add the oil in a stream, whisking, and whisk the dressing until it is emulsified. In a kettle of salted boiling water cook the pasta until it is tender, in a colander rinse it well, and drain it. In the bowl toss the pasta with the dressing, add the peas, the tomatoes, and the basil, and toss the salad well.

for crust: Blend flour, sugar and salt in processor 5 seconds. Add butter and shortening. Using on/off turns, process until mixture resembles coarse meal. Beat 2 tablespoons ice water and yolk in bowl to blend. Add to dough. Using on/off turns, blend until moist clumps form, adding more ice water by teaspoonfuls if dough is dry. Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk. Wrap in plastic; chill at least 30 minutes and up to 1 day.
for filling: Mix cherries and juices, sugar, tapioca, kirsch and salt in bowl. Let stand until tapioca looks translucent, stirring occasionally, about 1 hour.
for topping: Blend oats, flour, sugar, almonds, cinnamon and salt in large bowl. Add butter. Rub in with fingertips, pressing mixture together until moist clumps form; chill until ready to use.
Preheat oven to 425°F. Roll out dough on lightly floured surface to 13- to 14-inch round. Transfer to 9-inch-diameter deep-dish glass pie dish. Trim overhang to 3/4 inch; fold under. Crimp edge decoratively. Spoon filling into dough-lined dish. Sprinkle with topping. Bake pie 30 minutes. Reduce temperature to 400°F. Continue to bake until filling is bubbling thickly and topping is brown and crisp, covering edges with foil if browning too quickly, about 25 minutes longer. Cool at least 30 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.

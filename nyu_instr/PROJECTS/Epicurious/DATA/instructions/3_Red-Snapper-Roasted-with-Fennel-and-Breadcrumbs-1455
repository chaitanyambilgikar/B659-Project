Combine first 3 ingredients in medium bowl. Transfer 1 cup fennel mixture to large bowl. Add breadcrumbs and 1/4 cup olive oil to 1 cup fennel mixture in large bowl. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover fennel mixture and breadcrumb mixture separately and refrigerate.)

Spread generous amount of oil over inside and outside of fish. Season inside and outside with salt and pepper. Set fish atop fennel mixture in dish. Spread remaining fennel mixture inside fish. Spread breadcrumb mixture over top of fish, pressing to adhere.

Heat vinegar in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Working in 2 batches if necessary, add radicchio leaves; flatten with spatula and cook until softened, about 30 seconds per side. Transfer to plate to cool. Tear each leaf in half.
Place 2 crackers on each of 4 plates. Top each cracker with 1 radicchio leaf half. Spoon 2 tablespoons cheese atop radicchio on each cracker; drizzle 1/2 teaspoon honey over each. Top each with 1 Candied Spicy Walnut half. Sprinkle chopped candied walnuts over and serve.

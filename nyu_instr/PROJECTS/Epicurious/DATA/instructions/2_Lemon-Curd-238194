In large metal bowl, whisk together eggs, sugar, lemon juice, and butter. Set bowl over pot of simmering water and cook, whisking frequently, until mixture is thick enough to coat the back of wooden spoon, about 20 minutes. Immediately force curd through fine-mesh sieve into large bowl, scraping bottom of sieve. Press plastic wrap directly onto surface of curd to prevent skin from forming and chill until cold, at least 1 hour. (Curd can be made ahead and refrigerated up to 1 week before serving.)

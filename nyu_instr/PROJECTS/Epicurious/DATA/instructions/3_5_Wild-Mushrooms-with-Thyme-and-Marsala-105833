Boil cream and shallots in heavy large pot over medium-high heat 2 minutes. Add mushrooms and 1/4 cup Marsala. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until mushrooms are evenly coated, stirring occasionally, about 2 minutes. Add remaining 1/4 cup Marsala to mushrooms. Simmer until mushrooms are tender and sauce thickens enough to coat back of spoon, stirring occasionally, about 6 minutes. Stir in chopped thyme. Simmer until flavors blend, about 1 minute. Season to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cool, cover and refrigerate. Rewarm over low heat.) Transfer to serving bowl. Garnish with thyme sprigs.

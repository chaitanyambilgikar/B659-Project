Cover the rice with hot water and let stand for 10 minutes. Drain the rice in a sieve or colander and rinse until the water runs clear. Shake the sieve vigorously to remove excess water.
In a blender, combine the onion, garlic, salt, and 3 cups of water and process until puréed (use caution when blending hot liquids).
In a medium saucepan over moderate heat, heat the oil until hot but not smoking. Add the rice and sauté until it crackles when stirred, about 3 minutes. Add the onion and garlic mixture, bring to a boil, and cook for 3 minutes. Add the cilantro or parsley and reduce the heat to a simmer. Cover and cook until small holes appear in the rice, about 20 minutes. Fluff with a fork and remove the herb sprigs. Keep covered until ready to serve.

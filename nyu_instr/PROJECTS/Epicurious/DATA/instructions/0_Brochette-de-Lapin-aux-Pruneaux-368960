1. Bone the legs and loins. Cut each leg and each loin into 6 equal pieces; leave the kidneys whole.
2. Have ready 6 bamboo skewers. Thread the following onto each skewer: 1 leg piece, 1 bacon piece, 1 prune, 1 loin piece, 1 onion piece. Repeat again.
3. Arrange the skewers on a platter. Drizzle the olive oil evenly over the skewers, then sprinkle with the salt. Pluck the needles from the rosemary sprigs, and add a few pinches to each skewer.
4. Warm the canola oil and butter in a large frying pan over high heat. When the butter has melted and the fat is hot, add the skewers and cook, turning once, for 4 minutes on each side. Remove the pan from the heat and let the skewers rest for 3 minutes before serving.

Preheat oven to 400°F. Mix first 6 ingredients in medium bowl. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate)
Line large roasting pan with double layer of foil. Trim any tough rind and fat from upper side of ham, leaving 1/4-inch-thick layer of fat. Using long sharp knife, score fat in 1-inch-wide diamond pattern. Place ham in prepared pan. Pour Madeira and 1 cup orange juice into bottom of pan. Bake ham until heated through, about 45 minutes.
Remove pan from oven. Increase oven temperature to 450°F. Spread mustard mixture generously over top and sides of ham. Return to oven and continue to bake until mustard coating is golden brown, about 35 minutes.
Transfer ham to platter. Skim fat from pan juices and discard. Pour pan juices into medium saucepan. Add marjoram and bring to boil. Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper. Slice ham into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Serve with sauce.

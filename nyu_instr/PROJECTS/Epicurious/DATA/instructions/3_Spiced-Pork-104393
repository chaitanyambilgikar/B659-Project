Finely grind juniper berries, peppercorns, and allspice in an electric coffee/spice grinder, then stir together with brown sugar and salt in a small bowl. Rub spice mix all over pork and chill in a sealed plastic bag 1 day.
Transfer pork to a 6-quart pot and cover with cold water by 1 inch. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, covered, adding more water as needed to keep pork submerged, until meat is very tender, 3 to 3 1/2 hours.
Transfer pork to a cutting board and let stand 25 minutes before slicing.

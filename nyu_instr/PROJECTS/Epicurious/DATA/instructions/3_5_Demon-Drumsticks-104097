Divide drumsticks between 2 large resealable plastic bags. Whisk onion, oil, garlic and soy sauce in medium bowl to blend. Divide onion mixture between bags with drumsticks. Seal bags; turn to coat with marinade. Refrigerate overnight.
Preheat oven to 375°F. Line 2 large baking sheets with foil. Brush foil generously with vegetable oil.
Remove drumsticks from marinade; scrape off any onion or garlic. Place drumsticks in large bowl. Place breadcrumbs in another large bowl. Whisk mustard and wine in small bowl. Drizzle over drumsticks; toss well to coat. Sprinkle drumsticks with salt and pepper. Turn each drumstick in breadcrumbs, coating lightly but evenly. Place on prepared baking sheets.
Bake drumsticks 45 minutes. Increase heat to 400°F and bake drumsticks until evenly browned and cooked through, about 15 minutes longer.

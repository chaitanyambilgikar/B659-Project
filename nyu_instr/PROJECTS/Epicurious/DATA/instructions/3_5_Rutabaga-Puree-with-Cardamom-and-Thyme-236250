Place rutabagas in large pot with enough cold water to cover by 1 inch. Add salt and cardamom pods; bring to boil. Reduce heat, cover partially, and simmer until rutabagas are tender, about 25 minutes.
Drain rutabagas; discard cardamom. Working in batches, puree rutabagas in processor. Return puree to pot. Cook over medium heat until dry, stirring, about 5 minutes. Mix in créme fraîche and thyme. Season with salt and white pepper.
DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Spread puree in buttered baking dish. Cover; chill. Reheat in 350°F oven until heated through, about 25 minutes.

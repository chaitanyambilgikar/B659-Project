Make vinaigrette: Blend all ingredients in blender until smooth. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
Make salad: Grind peppercorns, coriander seeds and fennel seeds to fine powder. Lightly spray steak with nonstick spray; sprinkle each side with salt, pepper and 1 1/2 teaspoons spice mix. Let stand 30 minutes.
Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Grill steak until cooked to desired doneness, about 5 minutes per side for medium-rare. Using tongs, transfer steak to cutting board. Tent with foil to keep warm. Let rest 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, spray asparagus and onion slices with nonstick spray; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill asparagus until crisp-tender and slightly charred, turning often, about 5 minutes. Transfer asparagus to plate. Keeping slices intact, grill onion until slightly charred and almost tender, about 4 minutes per side; transfer to plate with asparagus.
Cut steak crosswise into thin slices. Arrange steak and asparagus on 6 plates. Drizzle with vinaigrette. Garnish salads with some onion rings and orange slices.

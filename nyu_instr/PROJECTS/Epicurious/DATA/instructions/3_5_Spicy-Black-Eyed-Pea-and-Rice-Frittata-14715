Quick-soak black-eyed peas. In a saucepan simmer peas in water to cover until tender, about 20 minutes, and drain in a sieve.
Chop onion and mince garlic. Cut bell pepper into 1/4-inch dice. In a 3-quart kettle cook onion, garlic, bell pepper, and red pepper flakes in 2 tablespoons butter over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until onion is softened.

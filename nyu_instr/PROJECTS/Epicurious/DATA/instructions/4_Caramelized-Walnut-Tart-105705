Preheat oven to 400°F. Transfer crust to 9-inch tart pan with removable bottom, folding in overhang to form double-thick sides. Freeze crust while preparing filling.
Whisk cream, sugar, corn syrup, vanilla, and cinnamon in heavy large saucepan. Stir in walnuts. Simmer over medium heat until mixture is bubbling and darkens slightly, stirring until sugar dissolves, about 3 minutes. Spread filling evenly in crust. Bake tart until filling is deep golden brown and crust is golden, about 25 minutes. Cool completely in pan on rack. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and store at room temperature.) Remove tart from pan and serve.

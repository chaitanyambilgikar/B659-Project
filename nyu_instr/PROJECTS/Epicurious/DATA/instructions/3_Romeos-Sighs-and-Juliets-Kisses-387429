Romeo's Sighs Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line two half-sheet pans with parchment paper.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar. Add the almond extract. Add the salt and flour, beating just until each addition is incorporated.
Drop by rounded teaspoonfuls onto one of the prepared pans. Set aside until you prepare Juliet's Kisses.
Juliet's Kisses In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar. Add the vanilla. Add the salt, flour, and cocoa powder, beating until each addition is incorporated.
Drop by level teaspoonfuls onto the second prepared pan. (These cookies spread more than the Romeos.)
Place the pan of the Romeos and the pan of Juliets in the center of the oven. Bake 8 to 10 minutes, or until the Romeos just start to brown at the edges. Cool completely on wire racks.
Filling Spread the filling onto the flat side of a Romeo and sandwich together with a Juliet. Repeat this process with the remaining cookies.

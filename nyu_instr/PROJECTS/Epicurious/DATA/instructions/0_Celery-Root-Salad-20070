Scrub the celery root and cook it in salted water until tender, which may take anywhere from 20 minutes to 2 hours, depending upon the age of the root. When tender, cool, peel and slice into small julienne strips. Add onion juice, mustard and cream to the French dressing. Beat well. Let the celery root chill in this for several hours. If it absorbs all the marinade, add more to moisten. Serve sprinkled with the parsley, chervil and riced egg.

Heat an 8-inch nonstick omelet pan over medium heat.
Beat the eggs with the salt and pepper in a small bowl with a whisk or fork.
Place the butter in the pan and swirl it around in the pan to distribute evenly. When the butter has melted and the foam subsides, pour the eggs into the pan.
Let the eggs sit for a few seconds to begin cooking, then push the outer edges of the eggs toward the center of the pan with a spatula. As they cook, continue pushing the edges toward the center, allowing uncooked egg to flow to the outer edges of the pan.
When the eggs are still moist but no longer runny, place the desired filling on one side of the omelet.
Fold the omelet over the filling with a spatula. Slide the omelet onto a warm plate and serve immediately or keep warm while you make the remaining omelets. Garnish as desired.

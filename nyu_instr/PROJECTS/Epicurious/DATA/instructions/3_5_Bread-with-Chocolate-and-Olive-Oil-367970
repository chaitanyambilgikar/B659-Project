Preheat the oven or boiler to approximately 325°F. Coarsely grate the chocolate onto a plate. Place the bread on a baking sheet or heatproof plate. Toast under the broiler until golden on both sides. Spoon the grated chocolate over the toast, covering it completely. Pour the olive oil over the chocolate and sprinkle with the salt flakes.

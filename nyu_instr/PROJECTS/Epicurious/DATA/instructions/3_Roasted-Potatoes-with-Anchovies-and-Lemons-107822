Preheat oven to 450°F.
Toss potatoes with salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons oil in a large shallow baking pan (1 inch deep). Roast in lower third of oven, without turning or stirring, until undersides are golden brown, about 20 minutes.
While potatoes are roasting, whisk together anchovies, lemon juice, and remaining tablespoon oil.
Turn potatoes over and roast in lower third of oven 10 minutes more. Toss potatoes with garlic and roast 5 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and stir in anchovy mixture, parsley, and salt and pepper to taste. Serve warm.

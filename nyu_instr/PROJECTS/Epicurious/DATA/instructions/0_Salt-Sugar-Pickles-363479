Prepare the vegetables and fruit and arrange in separate bowls; there should be about 1 1/2 cups of each kind.
Halve the radishes and slice into thin wedges.
Cut the daikon radishes crosswise into slices about 1/8 inch thick.
Cut the cucumbers crosswise into slices about 1/4 inch thick.
Remove the rind of the watermelon and cut the flesh into slices 1/3 inch thick and then into 2-inch wedges.
In a small bowl, combine the salt and sugar, and sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon of the mixture over each vegetable and the watermelon and toss.
Let the pickles stand for 5 to 10 minutes, arrange separately on a platter, and serve immediately.

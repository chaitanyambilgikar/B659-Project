Make sauce: Stir together all sauce ingredients in a bowl until combined, then chill, covered, until ready to use.
Cook pork: Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350°F.
Cut pork crosswise into 1 1/4-inch-thick slices (medallions).
Whisk together flour, salt, and pepper in a shallow bowl.
Whisk together eggs with a pinch of salt in another shallow bowl and put bread crumbs in a third shallow bowl.
Working with 1 medallion at a time, dredge medallions in flour, shaking off excess, and dip in egg, letting excess drip off, then coat with crumbs, pressing to help them adhere. Arrange pork in 1 layer on a baking sheet.
Heat 1/4 inch oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat until hot but not smoking, then panfry medallions, turning over once, until golden brown, 6 to 8 minutes total. Transfer to a clean baking sheet and roast in oven until thermometer inserted horizontally into center of meat registers 145 to 150°F, 6 to 7 minutes.
Serve pork with sauce, lemon wedges, and watercress.

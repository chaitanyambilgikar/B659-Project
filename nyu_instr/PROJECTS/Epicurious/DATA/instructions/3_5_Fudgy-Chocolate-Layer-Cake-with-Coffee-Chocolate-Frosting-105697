For cake: Preheat oven to 325°F. Butter and flour two 9-inch round cake pans with 2-inch-high sides. Whisk first 4 ingredients in large bowl to blend. Bring 1 cup water to simmer in heavy small saucepan. Remove from heat. Add 2 tablespoons espresso powder; stir to dissolve. Add chocolate; whisk until chocolate is melted and smooth. Cool slightly.
In another large bowl, whisk vegetable oil, sour cream, eggs and vanilla to blend. Add chocolate mixture and whisk to blend well. Add 1/3 of chocolate-sour cream mixture to dry ingredients and whisk to blend. Add remaining chocolate-sour cream mixture in 2 more additions, whisking well after each addition. Divide batter equally between prepared pans. Gently tap each filled pan atop counter to burst any air pockets.
Bake cakes until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes. Run knife around sides of cakes and turn out onto rack. Cool completely.
For frosting: Bring first 6 ingredients to simmer in heavy large saucepan over medium heat, stirring until butter melts. Remove from heat. Add chocolate and whisk until melted and smooth. Whisk in vanilla. Pour frosting into large bowl; cool until thick enough to spread, stirring occasionally, about 3 hours.
Place 1 cake layer on plate. Spread 1/3 of frosting over cake. Top with second layer; spread remaining frosting over top and sides of cake. Allow cake to stand 2 hours before serving. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Bring to room temperature before serving.)

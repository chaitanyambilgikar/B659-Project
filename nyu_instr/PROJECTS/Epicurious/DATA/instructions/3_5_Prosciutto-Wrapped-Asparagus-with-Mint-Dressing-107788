Peel asparagus with a vegetable peeler starting 2 inches from tips, then cook in a large pot of boiling salted water until crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Drain in a colander, then transfer to a bowl of ice and cold water to stop cooking. Drain and pat dry with paper towels.
Divide asparagus among 4 plates and wrap each pile with a slice of prosciutto to form a bundle.
Blend together mint, garlic, broth, oil, lemon juice, salt, and pepper in a blender, scraping down sides frequently, until smooth. Drizzle dressing over asparagus.

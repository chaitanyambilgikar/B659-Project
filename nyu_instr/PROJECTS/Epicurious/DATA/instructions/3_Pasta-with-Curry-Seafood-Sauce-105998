Mix 1/2 cup stock and cornstarch in small bowl to blend. Heat oil in heavy large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add shrimp, shallots, and garlic; sauté 1 minute. Stir in crabmeat. Add wine and simmer until almost evaporated, about 2 minutes. Add 1 1/4 cups stock and bring to boil. Stir cornstarch mixture to blend; mix into sauce. Bring to boil, stirring frequently. Reduce heat and simmer until sauce thickens, about 1 minute. Add cream and curry powder; simmer until slightly thickened, about 3 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Cover to keep warm.
Meanwhile, bring 12 cups water and saffron to boil in heavy large pot. Add pasta; cook until tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally. Drain. Divide cooked pasta equally among plates. Ladle sauce over and serve immediately.

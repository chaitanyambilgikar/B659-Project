Preheat oven to 325°F. Coat a heavy baking sheet well with cooking spray or line with parchment paper.
In a bowl whisk together ground almonds, flour, sugar, and salt and whisk in whites, butter, and almond extract until combined well. Drop rounded teaspoons batter about 4 inches apart onto baking sheet and with back of a spoon spread into 3 1/2-inch rounds. Sprinkle each cookie with about 1/2 tablespoon sliced almonds and bake in middle of oven 8 minutes, or until golden.
Working quickly, remove cookies, 1 at a time, from baking sheet with a thin spatula and drape over a rolling pin to create a curved shape. (If the cookies become too brittle to form on the rolling pin, return baking sheet to oven a few seconds to allow cookies to soften.) Cool cookies completely on rolling pin and transfer to an airtight container. Make more cookies with remaining batter in same manner, spraying or lining baking sheet for each batch. Tuiles may be made 2 days ahead and kept in an airtight container at room temperature.

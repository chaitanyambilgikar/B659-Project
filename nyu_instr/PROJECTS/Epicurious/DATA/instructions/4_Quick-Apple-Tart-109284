Preheat oven to 400°F. Line baking sheet with parchment paper. Unfold pastry on parchment paper. Using tines of fork, pierce 1/2-inch border around edge of pastry, then pierce center all over. Arrange apples atop pastry in 4 rows, overlapping apple slices and leaving border clear. Brush apples with melted butter; sprinkle with cinnamon sugar. Bake 30 minutes. Brush melted jam over apples. Bake tart until golden, about 8 minutes longer. Serve warm or at room temperature.

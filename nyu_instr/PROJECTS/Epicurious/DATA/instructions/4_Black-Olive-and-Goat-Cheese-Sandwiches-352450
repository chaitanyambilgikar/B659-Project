1. Lay the tortillas in front of you. Spread 1/4 cup of the goat cheese over the center portion of each tortilla. Spread 1 generous tablespoon of the tapenade over the goat cheese.
2. Cut each pepper half into 6 strips and lay 3 strips along the center of each tortilla. Top the pepper with some frisée.
3. Fold two sides of the tortilla over the frisée, then roll up the tortilla. Cut each wrap crosswise into 4 pieces and serve from a platter.

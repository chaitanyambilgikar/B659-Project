Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter and sugar eight 3/4-cup soufflé dishes or custard cups. Melt Mexican chocolate and butter in heavy medium saucepan over low heat, stirring constantly until melted (mixture will be grainy). Whisk egg yolks in large bowl to blend. Gradually whisk in hot chocolate mixture. Using electric mixer, beat egg whites in another large bowl until stiff but not dry. Fold 1/4 of egg whites into warm chocolate mixture to lighten. Fold in remaining egg whites. Divide soufflé mixture among prepared soufflé dishes.
Place dishes on rimmed baking sheet. Bake until tops have risen about 1/2 inch above rim of dish and appear dry and centers are softly set, about 18 minutes. Serve soufflés with sweetened whipped cream.

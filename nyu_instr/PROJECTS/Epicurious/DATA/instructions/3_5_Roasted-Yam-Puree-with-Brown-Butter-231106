Preheat oven to 400°F. Roast yams until tender when pierced with knife, about 1 hour. Cool slightly.
Melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Cook until butter turns light brown, about 5 minutes.
Scoop flesh from yams into processor. Process until smooth. Blend in brown butter. Season to taste with salt. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Rewarm in microwave before serving.)

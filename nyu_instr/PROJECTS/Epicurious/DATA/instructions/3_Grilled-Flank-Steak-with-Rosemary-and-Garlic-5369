Whisk oil, garlic and rosemary in 13 x 9 x 2-inch glass baking dish. Add steak; turn to coat. Cover; refrigerate at least 30 minutes or overnight, turning steak occasionally.
Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat) or preheat broiler. Remove steak from marinade, letting excess drip off. Sprinkle steak with salt and pepper. Grill or broil steak until cooked to desired doneness, about 4 minutes per side for medium-rare. Transfer steak to platter. Slice thinly on diagonal across grain.

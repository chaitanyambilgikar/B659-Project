Heat oil in heavy large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add shallots and sauté until beginning to brown, about 8 minutes. Add Marsala and sugar and stir until sugar dissolves. Add cranberries, curry powder and mustard. Bring to boil, reduce heat to medium and boil gently until berries pop, stirring occasionally, about 7 minutes. Remove from heat and mix in ginger. Cool. Season relish to taste with salt. Cover and refrigerate. (Can be prepared 3 days ahead. Keep refrigerated.)

Heat a well-seasoned ridged grill pan (preferably cast-iron) over moderately high heat until beginning to smoke, then brush with oil.
While pan heats, pat steak dry and stir together spices and salt, then rub all over both sides of steak.
Grill steak, turning over once, 9 to 11 minutes total for medium-rare. Transfer to a cutting board and let stand 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, cut romaine crosswise into thin shreds. Quarter avocados lengthwise, then pit, peel, and cut lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick slices.
While steak is standing, stack tortillas, wrapped completely in dampened paper towels, on a microwave-safe plate and cook in a microwave oven at high power (100 percent) until tortillas are hot, about 1 1/2 minutes.
Holding knife at a 45-degree angle, thinly slice steak across the grain. Serve with tortillas, avocado, romaine, and cilantro.

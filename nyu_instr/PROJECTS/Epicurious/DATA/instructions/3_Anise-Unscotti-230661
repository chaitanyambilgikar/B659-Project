Preheat oven to 350°F. Lightly sprinkle large rimmed baking sheet with flour. Combine 2 3/4 cups flour, baking powder, aniseed, and salt in medium bowl; whisk to blend.
Using electric mixer, beat sugar and oil in large bowl until thick. Beat in eggs, 1 at a time, then liqueur. Beat in flour mixture just until blended. Turn dough out onto lightly floured work surface. Gather dough together; divide in half. Shape each half into 9 1/2-inch-long log (about 3 inches wide), sprinkling with more flour if dough is very sticky. Transfer logs to prepared baking sheet. Bake logs until tops are golden and tester inserted into center comes out clean, turning sheet once to brown evenly, about 35 minutes. Cool on sheet 15 minutes. Using serrated knife, cut logs on slight diagonal into 3/4-inch-wide slices. Transfer cookies to racks and cool.

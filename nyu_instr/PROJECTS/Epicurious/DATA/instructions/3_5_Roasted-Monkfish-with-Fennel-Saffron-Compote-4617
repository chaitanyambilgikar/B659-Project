Using small sharp knife, trim all membrane and gray portions from monkfish fillets. Combine oil, garlic and saffron in large bowl. Add fish and turn to coat. Cover and refrigerate, turning occasionally, at least 3 hours and up to 1 day.
Preheat oven to 450°F. Arrange fish, with marinade still clinging, on rimmed baking sheet. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Roast until fish feels firm to touch and is cooked through, about 15 minutes. Spoon Fennel-Saffron Compote onto plates. Slice fish on diagonal into 1/2-inch-thick medallions. Arrange atop compote.

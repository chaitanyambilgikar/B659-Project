Cut radicchio into quarters through root end, cutting away any tough core but keeping quarters intact. In a skillet heat olive oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and sauté radicchio, turning it occasionally, 5 minutes, or until tender. Season radicchio with salt and pepper and keep warm, covered.
While radicchio is cooking, in a deep heavy skillet heat 1/2 inch vegetable oil over moderate heat until hot but not smoking (about 350°F. on a deep-fat thermometer) and fry kale leaves, 1 at a time, turning them once, until crisp, about 15 seconds (kale will cause oil to spatter). Transfer kale as fried with tongs to paper towels to drain and season with salt. Serve kale with radicchio.

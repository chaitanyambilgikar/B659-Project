Whisk yolks, sugar and 1/4 cup water in medium metal bowl to blend. Set bowl over saucepan of simmering water (do not let bowl touch water). Whisk until mixture registers 170°F on candy thermometer, about 4 minutes. Remove bowl from over water. Using electric mixer, beat mixture until cool and thick, about 6 minutes.
Using mixer fitted with clean dry beaters, beat cream, brandy, vanilla and nutmeg in large bowl until stiff peaks form. Fold cream mixture into yolk mixture.
Spoon mousse into 13 x 9 x 2-inch glass baking dish. Cover mousse and freeze until firm, at least 6 hours or overnight.
Bring half and half to simmer in medium saucepan. Remove from heat. Add chocolate; whisk until smooth. (Mousse and sauce can be made 3 days ahead. Keep mousse frozen. Cover sauce and chill; rewarm over low heat.)
Scoop mousse into parfait glasses. Spoon sauce over and serve.

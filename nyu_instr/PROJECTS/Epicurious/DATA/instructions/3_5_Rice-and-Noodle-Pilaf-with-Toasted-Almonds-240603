Melt butter in a 4- to 5-quart heavy pot over medium heat and stir in orzo. Cook, stirring frequently, until orzo is golden, about 5 minutes. Add rice, stirring until coated with butter, then add zest, bay leaf, cinnamon stick, water, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Bring to a boil, uncovered, then cover tightly and cook over low heat until water is absorbed and rice and orzo are tender, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, 5 minutes.
Fluff pilaf with a fork and spoon into a bowl, discarding zest, bay leaf, and cinnamon stick. Serve pilaf with almonds sprinkled on top.

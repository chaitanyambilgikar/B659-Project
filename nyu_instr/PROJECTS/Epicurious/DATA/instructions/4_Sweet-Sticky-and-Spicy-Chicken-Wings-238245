Grilling method: Indirect High
1. Chop the wings between the joints into 3 pieces. Discard the wing tips or save for another use. In a small bowl, mix the salt, cinnamon, cumin, garlic powder, and cayenne together. Season the chicken wings with the spice mixture. Cover and refrigerate while building the fire.
2. Build a charcoal fire in an outdoor grill for indirect high grilling and let burn until the coals are almost completely covered with white ash.
3. Meanwhile, pulse the chutney and pomegranate molasses in a food processor until the chunky bits of mango are minced. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.
4. Lightly oil the grill grate. Place the wings on the cooler area of the grill and cover. Grill for 15 minutes. Turn the wings and cook until they are browned and show no sign of pink when pierced at the thickest part near a bone, about 20 minutes longer. During the last few minutes, brush the tops of the wings with half the chutney mixture.
5. Turn the wings, moving them to the hotter area, directly over the coals. Brush with the remaining chutney mixture. Cook, turning occasionally, until the wings are glazed, about 2 minutes. (Although most of the fat will have cooked away by this point, the wings are likely to flare up, so adjust the final glazing time as needed.) Transfer to a platter and serve hot.

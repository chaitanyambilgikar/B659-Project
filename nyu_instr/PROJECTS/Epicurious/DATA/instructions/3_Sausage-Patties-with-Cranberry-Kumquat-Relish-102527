Combine cranberries, kumquats, sugar and 2 teaspoons horseradish in processor. Chop finely, using on/off turns (do not puree). Transfer relish to small bowl; mix in 2 teaspoons mint. Season with salt and pepper. Let stand 10 minutes.
Mix sausage with remaining 2 teaspoons horseradish and 2 teaspoons mint in medium bowl. Shape into four 1/2-inch-thick patties. Heat medium skillet over medium heat. Add patties and sauté until cooked through, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer patties to 2 plates. Spoon relish alongside and serve.

Using electric mixer, beat cream in large bowl until stiff peaks form. Mix lemon curd, lemon juice and peel in another large bowl to blend. Fold in whipped cream, then 2 1/2 cups raspberries.
Divide lemon mixture among six 8- to 10-ounce wineglasses or dessert cups. Cover and chill until parfaits are cold, at least 30 minutes and up to 1 day.
Sprinkle remaining 1 cup raspberries atop parfaits and serve immediately.

Mix artichoke hearts, peperoncini with juice from jar, onion, capers, oregano, and chili-garlic sauce in small bowl; season to taste with pepper.
Arrange rolls, cut side up, on work surface; spread artichoke mixture over, dividing equally. Divide provolone cheese, then deli meats and arugula, between the bottom 2 halves. Cover with roll tops. Cut each sandwich diagonally in half and serve.

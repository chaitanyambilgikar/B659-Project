Fill a 6-quart pasta pot three fourths full with salted water and bring to a boil for pasta.
Mince garlic and chop herbs. Quarter large bocconcini and halve smaller ones. In a large bowl toss cheese with garlic, herbs, red pepper flakes, oil, and salt to taste.
Cook pasta in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until al dente and ladle out and reserve 1/4 cup pasta water. Drain pasta in a colander. Stir vinegar and arugula into cheese mixture and add hot pasta and 1/4 cup reserved pasta water, gently tossing (and adding more pasta water as needed if mixture becomes dry) until combined well.

1. Strip the kernels off the corn as close as possible to the cobs. Place both the kernels and the cobs in a large, heavy pot with the broth, making sure the broth covers both the cobs and the kernels. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer, partially covered, for 30 minutes or until the corn is tender and the broth is flavored. Set aside to cool. Remove and discard the cobs.
2. Puree the soup in a food processor.
3. Pour the soup through a fine strainer back into the pot to remove any particles from the kernels, tapping the strainer well to extract as much liquid as possible. Add the lemon juice and salt. Heat through over very low heat for the flavors to blend. Cool to room temperature.
4. Stir in the coconut milk. Chill in the refrigerator for up to 6 hours. Adjust the seasonings. Serve the soup chilled, garnished with basil or cilantro.

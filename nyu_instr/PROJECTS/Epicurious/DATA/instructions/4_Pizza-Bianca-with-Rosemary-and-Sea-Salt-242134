Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Divide dough in half. Stretch and roll each piece to 10-inch round. Brush 1 side of each dough round or baked crust with oil, then sprinkle each with 1/2 teaspoon rosemary, sea salt, and pepper. Place on grill, seasoned side down. Brush tops with oil, then sprinkle each with 1/2 teaspoon rosemary, sea salt, and pepper. Grill until just golden, about 4 minutes per side for fresh dough and 2 minutes per side for baked crusts.
Cut pizzas into wedges and serve.

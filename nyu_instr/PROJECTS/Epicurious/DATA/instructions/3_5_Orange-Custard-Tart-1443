For crust: Combine first 5 ingredients in large bowl. Add butter, egg yolk and vanilla. Using electric mixer, blend until coarse crumbs form. Knead into ball. (Dough will be very soft.) Pat dough onto bottom and up sides of 13 1/2x4 1/4-inch rectangular tart pan or four 4-inch-diameter tartlet pans with removable bottom. Press into place; trim excess dough. Freeze 20 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350°F. Line crust with foil and fill with dried beans or pie weights. Bake 15 minutes. Remove foil and beans. Press crust up sides of pan if necessary. Bake 10 minutes longer. Cool.
For filling: Mix first 6 ingredients in medium bowl. Pour filling into crust. Bake until barely set, about 30 minutes. Cool 20 minutes. Refrigerate until custard is firm, about 3 hours. (Can be prepared 8 hour ahead.)
Using small sharp knife, cut between membranes of oranges to release segments. Drain well on paper towels. Arrange alternating rows of orange segments and raspberries atop tart.

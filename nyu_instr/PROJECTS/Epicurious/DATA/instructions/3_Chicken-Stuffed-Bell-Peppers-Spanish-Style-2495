Combine first 8 ingredients in medium bowl. Season to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 6 hours ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
Preheat oven to 375°F. Cut around stem of each bell pepper and remove, creating large opening at top. Scoop out seeds. Divide filling among peppers (about 1/2 cup each). Replace tops of peppers. Stand peppers in shallow casserole. Bake until filling is cooked through and peppers are tender, about 50 minutes. Serve immediately.

Preheat oven to 400°F. Brush 8x8x2-inch glass baking dish with 2 tablespoons butter. Place dish in oven 10 minutes (butter may brown).
Meanwhile, whisk cornmeal, flour, baking powder, salt, and baking soda in large bowl to blend. Add buttermilk and remaining 6 tablespoons melted butter. Stir batter just until evenly moistened (do not over mix).
Transfer cornbread batter to hot dish and spread evenly. Bake cornbread until crusty on top and tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Let cornbread cool at least 10 minutes. Serve warm.

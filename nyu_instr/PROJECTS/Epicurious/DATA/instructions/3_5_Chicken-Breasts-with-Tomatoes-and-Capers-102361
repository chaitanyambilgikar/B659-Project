Sprinkle the chicken well with salt and pepper.
Heat the oil and butter in a heavy-bottomed skillet. Add the chickenbreasts and sauté over medium-high heat, turning the pieces often until lightly browned, about 5 minutes.
Scatter the shallots and garlic around the chicken. Cook briefly; add the tarragon, tomatoes, vinegar, capers, wine, and tomato paste. Stir to dissolve the brown particles adhering to the bottom of the skillet.
Blend well. Bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked.
Sprinkle with parsley and serve.

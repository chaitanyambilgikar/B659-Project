Heat oil in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat. Pat neck, heart, gizzard and wing tips dry; add to pan and sauté until evenly browned, about 15 minutes. Add carrots, celery, onions, marjoram, thyme and bay leaves. Reduce heat to low, cover and cook until vegetables are tender, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes. Add 5 1/2 cups chicken broth, Sherry, cinnamon stick, cumin and coriander. Bring to simmer, cover partially and cook 1 hour to blend flavors, stirring occasionally. Strain turkey stock; discard solids in strainer. Spoon off fat. Season stock to taste with salt and pepper. Add more chicken broth if necessary to equal 5 1/2 cups liquid. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cool slightly. Chill uncovered until cold, then cover and keep chilled.)

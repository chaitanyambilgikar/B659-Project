Chop chocolates into small pieces and in a double boiler or a metal bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water melt chocolates with hazelnut butter, stirring until smooth. Remove top of double boiler or bowl from heat.
Split vanilla bean lengthwise and scrape seeds into a 3-quart heavy saucepan. Add pod, milk, and cream and bring mixture to a simmer over moderate heat. Remove pan from heat.
In a large bowl with an electric mixer beat together yolks and sugar until thick and pale. Add hot cream mixture to egg mixture in a slow stream, whisking, and pour into pan. Cook custard over moderately low heat, stirring constantly until a thermometer registers 170° F. (do not let the custard boil or it will curdle.)
Pour custard through a sieve into a clean bowl and stir in chocolate mixture until combined well. Chill custard, its surface covered with plastic wrap, until cold, at least 1 hour, and up to 1 day.
Serve ice cream sprinkled with hazelnuts.

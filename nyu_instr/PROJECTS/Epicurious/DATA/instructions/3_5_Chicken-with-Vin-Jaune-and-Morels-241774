Soak morels in boiling-hot water for 2 hours.
Squeeze liquid from morels into remaining soaking liquid (set morels aside), then strain soaking liquid through a paper-towel-lined sieve into a bowl and reserve 1/2 cup.
Cook shallot and garlic in butter with 1/4 teaspoon salt in a small heavy saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until tender and golden brown, about 3 minutes. Add cream and reserved soaking liquid and boil until reduced to about 3/4 cup, about 8 minutes.
Meanwhile, pat chicken dry and sprinkle with 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Heat oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers, then brown chicken in 2 batches, skin sides down first and turning once, until golden brown, about 6 minutes per batch. Transfer to a plate as browned.
Return chicken to skillet, skin sides up, with any juices from plate and add morels, reduced cream mixture, and 3/4 cup vin jaune. Cook at a bare simmer, covered, over low heat until tender, about 45 minutes.
Transfer chicken and morels to a serving dish and keep warm, loosely covered with foil. Boil sauce until slightly thickened and reduced to about 1 1/4 cups, about 5 minutes.
Pour sauce over chicken and morels and sprinkle with a little more vin jaune.

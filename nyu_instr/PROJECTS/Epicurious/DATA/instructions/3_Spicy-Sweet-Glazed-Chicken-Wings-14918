In a 6-quart kettle heat oil over moderate heat until a deep-fat thermometer registers 375°F.
While oil is heating, cut off wing tips, reserving them for another use (such as chicken stock), and halve chicken wings at joint. In a saucepan simmer remaining ingredients, stirring, until glaze is slightly thickened, about 3 minutes, and keep warm over very low heat.
Preheat oven to 200°F.
Pat chicken wings dry. Working in batches of 8, fry chicken wings in oil until crisp and golden, about 7 minutes. Return oil to 375°F. between batches. With a slotted spoon transfer wings as fried to a rack set in a shallow baking pan and keep warm in oven.
In a large bowl toss chicken wings with glaze to coat.

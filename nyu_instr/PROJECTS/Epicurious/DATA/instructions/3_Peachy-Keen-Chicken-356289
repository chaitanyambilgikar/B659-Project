1. Place the peaches in a food processor and process to a smooth puree. Add the oil and honey and process briefly to blend; transfer to a large resealable plastic bag. Add the chicken pieces and close, squeezing out the air. Chill for 15 minutes (or you can do it the day before).
2. Prepare the grill (gas grill at medium; charcoal grill arranged for indirect heat), heat a grill pan over medium heat, or preheat the broiler. Remove the chicken pieces from the bag and place on a plate. Season lightly with salt and pepper and transfer to the grill. Cover and cook until charred underneath, 4 to 5 minutes. Turn and cook until charred and firm when poked with a finger, 4 to 5 minutes more.

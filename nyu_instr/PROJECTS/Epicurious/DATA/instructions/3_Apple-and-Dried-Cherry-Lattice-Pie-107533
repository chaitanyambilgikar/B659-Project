For crust: Blend both flours, sugar, and salt in processor until just combined. Add butter and shortening. Using on/off turns, process until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add milk. Using on/off turns, process until moist clumps form. Gather dough into ball; divide into 2 pieces, 1 slightly larger than the other. Flatten larger piece into disk and smaller piece into rectangle. Wrap each in plastic; chill 1 hour. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Keep chilled.)
For filling: Preheat oven to 375°F. Place apples on large rimmed baking sheet; toss with 3 tablespoons sugar, 2 tablespoons butter, and lemon juice. Roast until apples are tender, stirring occasionally, about 45 minutes. Transfer to large bowl. Stir in cherries, brown sugar, and vanilla. Cool completely.
Butter 9-inch glass pie dish. Roll out dough disk on floured surface to 12-inch round. Transfer to pie dish; trim overhang to 1/2 inch. Spoon filling into crust.
Roll out dough rectangle on floured surface to 11x6-inch rectangle. Cut lengthwise into 8 strips. Arrange 4 strips across pie, spacing evenly. Place remaining 4 strips across first 4 strips, forming lattice pattern. Fold dough overhang over ends of strips; crimp edge. Brush strips and edge with 1 tablespoon butter.
Bake until pie is golden and filling is bubbling, covering edge with foil if browning too quickly, about 40 minutes. Cool 45 minutes. Dust pie with powdered sugar.

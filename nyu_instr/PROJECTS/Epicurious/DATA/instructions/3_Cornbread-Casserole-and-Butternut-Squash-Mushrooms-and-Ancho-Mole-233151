For filling: Heat oil in large pot over medium-high heat. Add onions; sauté until golden, about 10 minutes. Add mushrooms; sauté until tender, about 10 minutes. Add sage, thyme, garlic, and cumin; stir 1 minute. Add squash, beans, tomatoes with juice, and 1/2 cup water; bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium, cover, and simmer 8 minutes. Uncover and simmer until vegetables are tender and most of liquid has evaporated but mixture is still very moist, about 12 minutes. Season filling generously with salt and pepper. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cool slightly. Cover; chill.)
For cornbread: Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter 15x10x2-inch glass baking dish. Mix Masa Harina, cornmeal, salt, and baking powder in large bowl. Whisk 4 1/4 cups water, 6 tablespoons melted butter, eggs, and egg yolk in another large bowl to blend. Stir egg mixture into Masa Harina mixture. Stir in cheese and parsley, adding more water by tablespoonfuls as needed to form thick moist dough.
Transfer 4 cups dough to prepared baking dish. Place large piece of plastic wrap atop dough. Using plastic as aid, press dough evenly over bottom and 3/4 of the way up sides of dish; peel off plastic. Spoon filling into dough in dish, spreading evenly. Spoon remaining dough in small dollops atop filling. Using offset spatula, gently spread dollops evenly over filling to cover. Press top and bottom dough together at edges to seal, enclosing filling. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover; chill.)
Brush top of casserole with 4 tablespoons melted butter. Bake until dough is light golden and casserole is heated through, about 1 hour (or about 1 hour 15 minutes if chilled). Cool 10 minutes. Cut into squares; serve with Ancho Mole.

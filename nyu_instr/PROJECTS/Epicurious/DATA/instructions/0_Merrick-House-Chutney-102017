Peel and cut enough cantaloupe rind (including 1/4" of the pulp) to make 4 pounds. Cut the rind into bite-sized pieces and parboil for 12 minutes. Drain and combine with remaining ingredients in a large pot. Cover and simmer over medium heat for 3/4 hour. Uncover and continue cooking for 3/4 hour or until the juice has thickened to a light syrup. Pour into hot, sterilized preserving jars, cover and seal.

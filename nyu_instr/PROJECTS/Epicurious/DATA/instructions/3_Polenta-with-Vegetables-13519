In a 2-quart microwave-safe round glass casserole with a lid stir together the water, the broth, the cornmeal, the cream, and the salt and microwave the mixture, covered, at high power (100%), stirring every 2 minutes, for 6 minutes, or until the cornmeal is cooked but the mixture is still soft. In a small heavy skillet sauté the carrot, the onion, the mushrooms, and the garlic in the oil over moderately high heat, stirring frequently, for 3 minutes, or until the vegetables are crisp-tender and golden, and stir into the polenta the vegetable mixture, the Parmesan, and the red pepper flakes.

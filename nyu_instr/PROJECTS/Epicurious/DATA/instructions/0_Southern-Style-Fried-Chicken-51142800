Rinse chicken and pat dry with paper towels. Place shortening in a large cast-iron skillet and heat to 350°F. Melted shortening should be 1/2 inch deep.
In a shallow bowl, whip together buttermilk and eggs. In another shallow bowl, combine flour, salt, and pepper. Dip chicken pieces in egg mixture, then dredge in seasoned flour. Carefully place about half of the chicken pieces in hot shortening. (The temperature of the shortening will drop when you add the chicken; try to maintain a temperature of 325°F.) Fry chicken until golden brown on all sides or until each piece reaches an internal temperature of 160°F, turning the chicken several times to prevent burned spots. This will take about 10 minutes for skinless breasts and 20 minutes for pieces with skin and bones. Drain cooked chicken on a rack, then keep warm in a 200°F oven while frying remaining chicken. Serve with chicken velouté.

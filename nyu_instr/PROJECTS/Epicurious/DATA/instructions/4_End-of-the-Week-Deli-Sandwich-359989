Preheat oven to 400°F. Place bread, cut side up, on baking sheet. Mix pesto and mayonnaise in small bowl; spread over both cut sides of bread. Arrange cheese on bottom half of bread. Bake bread halves until lightly toasted, about 10 minutes. Top cheese with meats, then peperoncini, onion, tomatoes, and arugula. Cover with top half of bread. Cut lengthwise in half, then crosswise into 6 sandwiches.

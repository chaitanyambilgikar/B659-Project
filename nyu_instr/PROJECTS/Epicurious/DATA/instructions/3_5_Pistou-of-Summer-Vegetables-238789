Drain in colander, then immediately plunge colander into ice water to stop cooking. Drain again and spread on paper towels to dry.

(Asparagus, fava beans, sugar snap peas, and basil can be blanched up to 4 hours ahead, then dried well, and chilled, covered until needed.)
Make pistou: In large bowl, toss together asparagus, fava beans, and peas. Transfer half vegetable mixture to blender and add basil. Blend until chopped, then add 5 tablespoons olive oil in slow, steady stream, and blend until smooth.
In heavy, large saucepan, over moderately high heat, heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil until hot but not smoking. Add shallot and sauté until translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in vegetable stock, vegetable purée, remaining blanched vegetables, salt, and pepper and bring to simmer. Cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally until vegetables are heated through, 3 to 5 minutes. Ladle into bowls, sprinkle each with herb mixture, and serve immediately.

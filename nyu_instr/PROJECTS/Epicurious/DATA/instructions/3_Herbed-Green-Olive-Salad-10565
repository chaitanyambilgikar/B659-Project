In a bowl toss together the olives, the celery, the bell pepper, the onion, the garlic paste, the carrot, the parsley, the orégano, and the red pepper flakes, add the vinegar and the oil, and combine the mixture well. Serve the salad as part of an antipasto or as an accompaniment to cheese, salami, and crusty bread.

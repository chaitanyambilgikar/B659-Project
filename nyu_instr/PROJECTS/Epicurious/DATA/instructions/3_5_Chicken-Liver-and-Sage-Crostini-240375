Line plate with paper towels. Heat oil in medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add sliced sage; sauté until crisp, about 30 seconds. Using slotted spoon, transfer sauteed sage to paper towels. Add onion to same skillet; sauté until golden, about 3 minutes. Add garlic, chopped liver, and 1 teaspoon chopped sage. Stir until liver is no longer red, about 3 minutes. Increase heat to high, add Madeira, and cook until wine has evaporated, about 2 minutes. Add salt and pepper. Divide liver mixture among baguette slices. Top with sautéed sage. Serve crostini on bed of fresh sage leaves, if desired.

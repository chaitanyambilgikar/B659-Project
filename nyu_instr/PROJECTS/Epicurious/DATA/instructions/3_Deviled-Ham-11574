In a food processor grind the ham until it is minced, add the mustard, the butter, the honey, and the cloves, and blend the mixture until it is smooth. Transfer the mixture into a bowl and stir in the onion, the pickle, and pepper to taste. Serve the deviled ham with crackers or as a sandwich filling.

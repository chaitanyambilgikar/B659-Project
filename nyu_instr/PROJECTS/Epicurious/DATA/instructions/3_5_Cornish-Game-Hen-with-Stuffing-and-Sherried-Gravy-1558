Preheat oven to 475°F. Butter 11x7-inch baking pan. Bring 6 tablespoons broth just to simmer in medium saucepan; remove from heat. Mix in stuffing mix and 1 teaspoon sage. Spoon stuffing in 4 equal mounds in prepared pan. Season hen quarters with 1 teaspoon sage and salt and pepper. Press 1 hen quarter onto each stuffing mound.
Bake until hen is golden brown and juices run clear when hen is pierced with skewer, about 20 minutes. Transfer hen and stuffing to 2 plates; tent with foil to keep warm. Do not clean baking pan.
Place liver and remaining 1/4 cup broth in same baking pan. Set pan over medium heat. Boil until slightly thickened, scraping up browned bits, about 2 minutes. Mix in dry Sherry; simmer 1 minute. Spoon gravy over hen pieces and serve immediately.

Put flour and ground saltine crackers in 2 separate small bowls and season flour with salt and pepper. Beat 1 egg with a fork in a small bowl and season with salt and pepper. Pat oysters dry and coat, 1 at a time, in flour, then egg, then cracker crumbs, shaking off excess between each coating. Put coated oysters on a plate.
Beat remaining 3 eggs with a fork for omelet. Heat butter in an 8-inch nonstick skillet over moderate heat until foam subsides, then fry oysters until golden, about 1 minute per side, transferring with tongs to paper towels to drain.
Reduce heat to moderately low, then add eggs to skillet and cook, stirring gently, until half set, about 1 minute. Season with salt and pepper. Arrange oysters over half of eggs opposite skillet handle, then continue to cook until eggs are just set, about 1 minute more. Fold omelet over oysters and invert onto a plate.

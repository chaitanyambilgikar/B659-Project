Follow directions for Master Sweet Dough, scraping in seeds from vanilla bean as directed.
Coat muffin pan cups with melted butter. Punch down dough; divide in half. Roll half of dough on a lightly floured surface into a 12"-long log (cover remaining dough with plastic wrap). Cut log into 6 equal pieces. Cut 1 piece into 3 equal pieces. Roll each third into a 1" ball by cupping your hand and pushing dough against work surface as you roll it in a circular motion. Place 3 balls side by side in 1 muffin cup. Repeat with remaining pieces, then with remaining half of dough.
Loosely cover pan with plastic wrap or a kitchen towel and let sit in a warm, draft-free area until dough rises about 1" above rim of muffin pan, 1-1 1/2 hours.
Arrange a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 375°F. Brush tops of rolls with milk, then sprinkle each with 1/2 teaspoon sugar.
Bake until puffed and golden brown, 18-20 minutes. Transfer rolls to a wire rack; let cool, 10-20 minutes. DO AHEAD: Let cool completely. Store airtight in freezer for up to 1 month. Let thaw at room temperature. Reheat on a baking sheet in a 350°F oven until warm, 5-10 minutes.
Serve sweet rolls warm or at room temperature with Strawberry Jam.

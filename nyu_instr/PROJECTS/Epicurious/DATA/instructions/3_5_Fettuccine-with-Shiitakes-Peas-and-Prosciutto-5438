Melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add green onions and shallots and sauté until onions soften, about 2 minutes. Add mushrooms and wine. Cover skillet and cook until mushrooms are tender, stirring occasionally, about 6 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low. Add peas and cream; simmer until peas are tender, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Meanwhile, cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite. Drain well.
Return pasta to same pot. Mix in mushroom sauce and prosciutto; season with salt and pepper. Transfer to large bowl; sprinkle with parsley and serve

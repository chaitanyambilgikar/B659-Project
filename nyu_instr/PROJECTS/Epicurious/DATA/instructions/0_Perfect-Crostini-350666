1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
2. Drizzle 2 tablespoons of the olive oil onto a large baking sheet.
3. Slice baguettes crosswise in 1/2-inch slices and lay slices in a single layer on baking sheet. Drizzle the remaining olive oil over slices. Sprinkle slices evenly with salt and bake until crispy and golden brown, approximately 20-25 minutes.

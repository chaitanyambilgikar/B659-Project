If using rosemary branches, remove leaves from all but top 3 inches of each branch. In a small bowl stir together chopped rosemary, paprika, and cayenne. Remove tough muscle from side of each scallop if necessary and pat scallops dry. Season scallops with salt and sprinkle with rosemary mixture. Thread 4 scallops onto each rosemary branch or bamboo skewer.
In a large non-stick skillet heat oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and sauté scallops until golden and just cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes on each side.
Serve scallops with potato salad and mango salsa.

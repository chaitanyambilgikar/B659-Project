1. Combine the oil, onion, ginger, garlic, turmeric, curry powder, and brown sugar in a large skillet and cook over medium heat until onions turn clear and smell sweet, about 5 minutes.
2. Add the sliced chicken breasts and cook until the meat is done, about 5–7 minutes.
3. Add 1 cup of water along with the broccoli, cauliflower, and carrot. Cook for about 15 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender. Add water as needed to maintain a saucy consistency.
4. Serve over hot, freshly cooked couscous.

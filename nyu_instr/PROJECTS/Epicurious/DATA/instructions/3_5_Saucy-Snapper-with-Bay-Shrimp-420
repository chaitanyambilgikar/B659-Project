Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large saucepan over medium heat. Add celery, onion, green pepper, garlic, fennel seeds and crushed red pepper and sauté until vegetables are soft but not brown, about 9 minutes. Mix in tomatoes with their juices, wine and tomato paste; simmer until sauce thickens, breaking up tomatoes with back of spoon, about 10 minutes. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover; Chill. Bring to simmer before continuing.)
Season fish with salt and pepper. Coat with flour. Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add snapper to skillet; sauté until brown, about 2 minutes per side. Pour sauce over snapper. Top with shrimp. Simmer until fish is just cooked through, about 10 minutes.

For Crust: Butter 11-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom. Sift all purpose flour, powdered sugar, cake flour, baking powder and salt into large bowl. Add butter. Using fingers, rub in butter until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add egg. Stir until moist clumps form. Gather into ball. Flatten into disk. Wrap in plastic; freeze 10 minutes.
Roll out dough on floured surface to 14-inch round. Transfer dough to prepared pan. Press dough gently into pan. Trim overhang to 1/2 inch. Fold overhang in and press, forming double-thick sides. Freeze until firm, about 20 minutes.
Preheat oven to 400°F. Line crust with foil. Fill with dried beans or pie weights. Bake until sides are set, about 15 minutes. Remove foil and beans. Reduce crust until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Cool crust completely.
For filling: Combine cream, butter and sugar in heavy large saucepan. Stir over medium heat until butter melts, sugar dissolves and mixture comes to simmer. Remove from heat. Add chocolate and both extracts. Stir until mixture is smooth. Pour 1 cup filling into heavy small saucepan and reserve for glaze. Pour remaining filling into large bowl. Chill until thickened but still spreadable, stirring occasionally, about 1 hour.
Whisk cold filling just until color lightens, about 2 minutes. Spoon into crust. Chill until firm, about 30 minutes.
Stir reserved 1 cup filling over low heat until just lukewarm. Spread over filling in crust to glaze tart. Chill until glaze sets, about 1 hour. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and keep chilled.) Serve cold.

In a saucepan, stir together a quarter cup (60ml) freshly squeezed lemon juice and its zest, a quarter cup freshly squeezed lime juice and its zest, and a half cup (100g) sugar. Simmer for a few minutes, until the sugar has dissolved. Taste and add more sugar if you’d like. Strain and let cool down in the fridge.
Stir in half a cup (125ml) heavy (double) cream and pour the mixture into an ice cube tray. When it’s frozen, spoon several cubes out into one big refreshing cup.

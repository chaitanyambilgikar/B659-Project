Place a rack in the upper third of the oven and preheat the oven to around 365°F (set the dial halfway between 350°F and 375°F). Generously grease an 8-inch square cake pan.
Combine the flour, baking powder, and powdered spices in a medium bowl and mix well; set aside. Pour the molasses into a 2-cup (or more) measuring cup, add the boiling water, and stir to dissolve thoroughly. Set aside.
Place the brown sugar and butter chunks in a large bowl and cream together with a wooden spoon, or a mixer. Briefly beat the eggs in another bowl, then stir them into the butter-sugar mixture. Add about 1/2 cup of the flour mixture and stir or beat in on low speed, then add about the same amount of warm molasses-water and stir. Continue to add the flour and liquid alternately, stirring or beating briefly each time. After the final addition, beat briefly (the batter will be quite liquid), then pour into the prepared pan.
Bake for 25 minutes, then lower the heat to 350°F and bake until done, for 15 to 20 minutes longer, until a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean.
Let cool in the pan for 20 minutes or more (to allow the crumb to set) before serving. Serve from the pan.

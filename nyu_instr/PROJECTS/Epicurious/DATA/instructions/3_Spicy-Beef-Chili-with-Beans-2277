Sauté bacon in heavy large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat until brown, about 4 minutes. Drain off fat and discard. Add beef to pot and sauté until brown, breaking up clumps with back of spoon, about 7 minutes. Add tomatoes with juices, beans and chili seasoning mix. Bring chili to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook until thickened to desired consistency, stirring occasionally, about 40 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Ladle chili into bowls. Serve, passing cheese, onions and sour cream separately.

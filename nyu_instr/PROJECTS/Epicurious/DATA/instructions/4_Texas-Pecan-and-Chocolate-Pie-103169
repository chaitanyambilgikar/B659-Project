For crust: Combine first 4 ingredients in processor. Using on/off turns, process until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Drizzle 2 tablespoons ice water over mixture. Process just until moist clumps form, adding more water by teaspoonfuls if mixture is dry. Gather dough into ball. Flatten into disk. Wrap dough in plastic and refrigerate 30 minutes. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Keep refrigerated.)
Preheat oven to 325°F. Roll out dough on floured surface to 13-inch round. Transfer to 9-inch-diameter glass pie dish. Trim overhang to 1 inch; fold under and crimp decoratively. Set aside.
For filling: Stir chocolate and butter in heavy small saucepan over low heat until melted. Cool slightly.
Whisk brown sugar, eggs and salt in large bowl to blend. Whisk in corn syrup and chocolate mixture. Sprinkle pecans over unbaked crust. Pour filling over pecans. Bake until crust is golden and filling is puffed, about 55 minutes.
Cool pie completely on rack.

Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add onion; sauté until golden, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and curry powder; stir 1 minute. Add 4 cups broth and lentils; bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until lentils are tender and almost all liquid is absorbed, stirring occasionally, about 40 minutes. Stir in tomatoes; thin with more broth if mixture is too thick. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Combine yogurt and ginger in small bowl. Serve lentil stew, passing ginger yogurt separately.

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Place the chuck, onion, parsley, 2 tablespoons of the chili sauce, the Worcestershire, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Toss together lightly.
2. Form the meat into a 5-inch by 3-inch oval loaf in a small baking pan. Spread the remaining tablespoon of chili sauce all over the surface of the meatloaf. Bake for 30 minutes, or until cooked through. Do not overbake.

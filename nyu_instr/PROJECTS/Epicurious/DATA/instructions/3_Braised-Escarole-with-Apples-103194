Heat 1 tablespoon butter in a large heavy skillet over moderately high heat until foam subsides, then sauté apple, stirring occasionally, until tender and slightly caramelized, about 2 minutes. Transfer apple to a dish with a slotted spoon.
Cook shallot in remaining tablespoon butter over moderate heat, stirring, until softened. Add garlic and cook, stirring, 30 seconds. Add escarole and toss over moderately high heat until it begins to wilt, about 1 minute. Add vinegar and water and cook, covered, until escarole is tender, about 4 minutes. Stir in apple, pecans, and salt and pepper to taste and cook until just heated through.

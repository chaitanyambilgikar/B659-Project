Stir together fennel seeds, 3/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Pat chicken dry, then sprinkle both sides with fennel mixture.
Heat 2 tablespoons butter with oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium heat until foam subsides, then cook 2 cutlets, turning once, until just cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes total. Transfer to a plate and cover loosely. Add remaining 2 cutlets to skillet and cook, then transfer to plate. (Butter will brown as chicken cooks.)
Add capers and orange juice to skillet along with any meat juices from plate and bring to a boil, scraping up brown bits. Remove from heat and swirl in remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Pour over chicken.

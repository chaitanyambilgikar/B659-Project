For vinaigrette: Thinly slice truffles, then dice finely. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in small skillet over medium heat. Add shallots; sauté 2 minutes. Add truffles and sauté until aromatic, about 1 minute. Place shallot mixture in small bowl.
Boil wine in heavy small saucepan until reduced to 2 tablespoons, about 10 minutes. Add to shallot mixture. Whisk in vinegar and thyme. Gradually whisk in remaining 7 tablespoons oil. Season vinaigrette to taste with coarse salt. (Can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.)
For steaks: Pat steaks dry. Brush 1 tablespoon oil over both sides of steaks. Sprinkle with coarse salt and coarsely ground black pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in each of 2 heavy large skillets over high heat. Add 2 steaks to each skillet and cook to desired doneness, about 2 minutes per side for rare to medium- rare (instant-read thermometer inserted into center of steaks registers 120°F to 125°F). Transfer steaks to platter; cover with foil to keep warm. Let rest 5 minutes.
Place steaks on plates. Spoon vinaigrette over and serve.

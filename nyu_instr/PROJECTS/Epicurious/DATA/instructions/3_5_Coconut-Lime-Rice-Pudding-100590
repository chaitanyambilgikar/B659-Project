In a bowl soak rice in cold water to cover 30 minutes. Drain rice in a sieve. In a 2- to 3-quart heavy saucepan bring coconut milk, whole milk, rice, sugar, and a pinch salt to a boil and gently simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, 25 minutes. Remove pan from heat.
Stir lime zest into pudding. Divide pudding among four 2/3-cup custard cups. Puddings may be made 2 days ahead and chilled, covered.
Serve puddings warm or chilled and garnish with flaked coconut.

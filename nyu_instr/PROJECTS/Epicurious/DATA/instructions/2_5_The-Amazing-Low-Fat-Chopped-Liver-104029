1. Preheat the oven to 450°. Trim the stem ends off the mushrooms and wipe the caps clean with a damp paper towl. Quarter any large mushrooms; halve medium size ones; leave any small mushrooms whole. Place the mushrooms and onion in a nonstick roasting pan and toss with the oil, salt, and pepper. Roast the mushrooms until lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes, stirring to insure even cooking.
2. Add the livers and continue roasting until the mushrooms are well browned and flavorful and the liver is cooked but still pink in the center, 8 to 10 minutes more.
3. Meanwhile, hard-cook the eggs for 11 minutes. When cool enough to handle, peel and halve the eggs. Remove and discard the yolks. Cut each white in half.
4. Place the mushrooms, onion, liver, hard-cooked egg whites, and parsley in a food processor and grind to a coarse purée. (Run the machine in short bursts.) Correct the seasoning, adding salt and pepper to taste: the mixture should be highly seasoned. Transfer the chopped liver to a bowl or platter, garnish with parsley sprigs, and serve with crackers or toasted challah.
Note: For a richer chop liver, keep two of the egg yolks. The fat level will still be below 4 g per servings.

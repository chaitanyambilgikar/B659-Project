Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Lightly oil a 24-cup mini muffin pan.
Whisk together flours, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Combine oil, rice syrup and erythritol in a small saucepan and cook, stirring, until the granules dissolve, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat and whisk in zests, juices and vanilla. Mix into dry ingredients and slowly mix in almond milk until a smooth batter forms. Fold in seeds until incorporated through the batter. Divide batter evenly among muffin cups, filling cups two-thirds full.
Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until the tops of the muffins spring back to the touch. Cool for 5 minutes before carefully removing the muffins from the cups. Transfer to a cooling rack and cool completely. (You can freeze and thaw these in pairs so you won't be tempted to eat the whole batch.)

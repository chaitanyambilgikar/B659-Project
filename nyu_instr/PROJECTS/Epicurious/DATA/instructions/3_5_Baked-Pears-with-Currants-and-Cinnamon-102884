Preheat oven to 350°F. Using apple corer, cut through stem of each pear and all the way through pear to base to remove core. Trim bottoms so that pears stand straight. Arrange pears in 15x10x2-inch glass baking dish. Combine sugar, brown sugar and cinnamon in medium bowl. Add currants. Fill pear cavities with half of sugar mixture. Stir cup water into remaining sugar mixture; pour around pears. (Can be made 8 hours ahead. Cover; chill.)
Bake pears uncovered until tender and sauce is syrupy, adding more water to dish by 1/4 cupfuls if syrup becomes too thick and basting occasionally, about 50 minutes. Serve pears warm with syrup.

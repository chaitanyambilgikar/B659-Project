Generously butter one 9 x 5 x 2 1/2-inch metal loaf pan or 2 clean 28-ounce food cans. Mix first 5 ingredients in large bowl. Whisk buttermilk, molasses and raisins in medium bowl to blend. Add buttermilk mixture to dry ingredients; stir until well blended.
Transfer all of batter to prepared loaf pan or divide batter between prepared cans (pan or each can will be about 3/4 full). Butter 1 piece of foil large enough to cover top of pan or each can and to overlap sides by 2 inches. Tightly cover top of pan or each can with foil, buttered side down. Tie kitchen string around foil. Place pan or cans in large wide pot. Pour enough water into pot to come halfway up sides of pan or cans. Bring water to boil. Reduce heat to low; cover pot tightly and simmer until tester inserted into center of bread comes out clean, adding more water to pot as necessary to keep water halfway up sides of pan or cans, about 3 hours.
Remove pan or cans from pot. Cool bread in pan or cans 15 minutes. Gently shake to remove bread from pan or cans. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cool completely. Return bread to pan or cans. Wrap tightly with foil. Store at room temperature. Before serving, if desired, steam in pan or cans, covered with foil and secured with kitchen string, on rack set over simmering water until heated through, about 15 minutes.) Cut bread into 1/3-inch-thick slices. Serve warm or at room temperature.

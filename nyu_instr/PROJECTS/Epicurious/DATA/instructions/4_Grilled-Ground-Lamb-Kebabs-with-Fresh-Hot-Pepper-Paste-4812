Combine lamb, onion, parsley, cilantro garlic, salt, pepper, paprika, and cayenne in large bowl and mix well. (Can be prepared 6 hours ahead. Cover and refrigerate.) Place bamboo skewers in shallow dish. Cover with cold water and let stand at least 1 hour.
Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Drain skewers. Form generous 1/4 cup lamb mixture into 3-inch-ling sausage around center of 1 bamboo skewer. Repeat with remaining lamb mixture and skewers. Brush lamb kebabs with oil. Grill kebabs until brown and cooked through, turning frequently, about 12 minutes. Serve in warm pita bread with Fresh Hot-Pepper Paste.

Position rack in top third of oven and preheat to 400°F. Place berries in 11x7-inch glass baking dish. Add 3/4 cup sugar, lemon juice, and 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon; mix gently. Bake berry mixture until juices are bubbling, about 40 minutes.
Meanwhile, mix flour, butter, remaining 1/2 cup sugar, and 1 teaspoon cinnamon in medium bowl. Rub topping together with fingertips, pressing until small moist clumps form.
Mix 2 tablespoons topping into warm berry mixture. Let stand 2 minutes. Sprinkle remaining topping over berry mixture. Bake until fruit is bubbling thickly and topping is golden brown and crisp, about 50 minutes longer. Let stand 10 minutes; serve with ice cream.

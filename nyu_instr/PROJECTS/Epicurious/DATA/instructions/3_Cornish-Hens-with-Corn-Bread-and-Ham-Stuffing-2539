For Stuffing: Heat oil in heavy medium skillet over medium heat. Add onion and celery; sauté until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Mix in remaining ingredients; stir until heated through. Remove skillet from heat. Season stuffing with salt and pepper. Cool slightly.
For Hens: Preheat oven to 375°F. Grease 13 x 9x2-inch baking dish. Season hens with salt and pepper. Place skin side down on work surface. Pack 1/4 of stuffing into each cavity. Arrange hens stuffing side down in prepared dish. Brush with mustard. Roast hens until golden brown and juices run clear when thighs are pierced, about 45 minutes. Transfer hens to platter and serve.

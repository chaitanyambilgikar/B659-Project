Combine broth and wine in saucepan. Bring to simmer over medium heat. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat. Add rice; stir 2 minutes. Stir in all but 1/4 cup broth-wine mixture. Stir constantly for 2 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer until rice is tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes.
Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms, sugar snap peas and bell pepper; sauté until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Stir into risotto along with cheese and mint. Mix in enough remaining broth mixture if needed to moisten. Season risotto with salt and pepper.

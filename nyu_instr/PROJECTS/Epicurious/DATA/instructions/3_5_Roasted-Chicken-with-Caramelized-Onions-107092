Preheat oven to 400°F. Bring garlic cloves and milk to boil in heavy medium saucepan over high heat. Drain. Discard milk. Transfer garlic cloves to 8x8x2-inch metal baking pan. Add 3 tablespoons oil and toss to coat. Roast until golden, about 13 minutes. Cool slightly. Transfer garlic with its cooking oil to processor; blend to form paste. Season to taste with salt and pepper. (Garlic paste can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
Melt butter and 1 tablespoon oil in heavy large skillet over medium-low heat. Add onions and sauté until golden brown, stirring occasionally, about 40 minutes. Add vinegar, thyme, and bay leaf. Simmer until liquid is reduced by half, about 3 minutes. Stir in cream. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Meanwhile, preheat oven to 450°F. Heat remaining 3 tablespoons oil in heavy large nonstick skillet over high heat. Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper. Working in 2 batches, add chicken, skin side down, to skillet and cook until skin is golden brown (do not turn), about 4 minutes. Place chicken, skin side up, on large rimmed baking sheet. Roast until chicken is cooked through and juices run clear when thigh is pierced with knife, about 20 minutes. Spread garlic paste atop chicken halves, dividing equally. Bake until golden brown, about 5 minutes longer.
Rewarm onions over medium-low heat, stirring often. Spoon onions in center of 4 plates. Place chicken halves atop onions. Sprinkle with parsley; serve.

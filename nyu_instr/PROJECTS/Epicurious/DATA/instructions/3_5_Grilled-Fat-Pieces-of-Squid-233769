Put the first seven ingredients in a small bowl and stir to combine. Set aside.
Place a large grill pan on two burners over medium-high heat or preheat an outdoor gas or charcoal grill and get it very hot. Take a few paper towels and fold them several times to make a square. Blot a small amount of oil on the paper towels and then carefully and quickly wipe the hot grates of the grill (or the ridges of the grill pan) to create a nonstick surface.
Rinse the squid under cool water and pat dry. Split the tubes from top to bottom, then cut in half diagonally so that you get 2 triangles from each squid. Score the flesh lightly in a diamond pattern. Thread a skewer through the length of each to keep the squid flat on the grill. Toss with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Lay the calamari on the grill and cook for 2 minutes on each side.
Serve the squid with the chili sauce, along with remaining lime juice and mint leaves.

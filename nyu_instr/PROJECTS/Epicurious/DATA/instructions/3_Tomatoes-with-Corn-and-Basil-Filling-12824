Cut 1/2 inch from the stem end of each tomato and with a melon-ball cutter scoop out and discard the seeds and pulp, leaving a 1/2-inch shell. Sprinkle the shells with salt and let them drain, inverted, on paper towels for 10 minutes. In a large saucepan combine the corn with enough salted cold water to cover it by 1 inch, bring the water to boil, and boil the corn for 5 minutes. Drain the corn, let it cool until it can be handled, and, working over a bowl, cut the kernels from the cobs with a serrated knife.
In a small bowl whisk together the vinegar and salt and pepper to taste, add the oil in a stream, whisking, and whisk the dressing until it is emulsified. To the corn add the dressing, the chopped basil, the scallion, and salt and pepper to taste.
In a skillet melt the butter over moderately high heat and in it sauté the bread cubes, stirring occasionally, until they are golden. Toss the croutons with the corn mixture, spoon the mixture into the tomatoes, and arrange the basil sprigs decoratively on the tomatoes.

In a large bowl whisk together yogurt, mayonnaise, vinegar, parsley, onion, and herbs.
In a kettle of boiling salted water cook pasta until tender, about 12 minutes. In a large colander drain pasta and rinse well under cold water. Drain pasta well and toss with dressing and salt and pepper to taste. Pasta salad may be made 4 hours ahead and chilled, covered. If pasta absorbs dressing while standing, toss with about 3 tablespoons warm water.

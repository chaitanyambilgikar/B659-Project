Make the filling: In a bowl toss together the scrod, the olives, the tomatoes, the scallions, the chilies, the lime juice, the vinegar, the oil, the coriander, and salt and black pepper to taste and chill the filling, covered, for at least 1 hour or overnight.
In a skillet heat 1/2 inch of the oil over moderately high heat until it is hot but not smoking, in it fry the tortillas, 1 at a time, folding them almost in half with tongs to form taco shells, for 1 minute, or until they are crisp and golden, and transfer them as they are fried with the tongs to paper towels to drain. Divide the filling among the tacos and top it with the lettuce and the radishes.

Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 325 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Set aside.
In a medium bowl, whisk together flaxseed, flaxseed meal, flours, baking soda, black pepper and salt. Add the butter, and using your fingers, quickly work the butter into the dry ingredients. Some of the butter will resemble oatmeal flakes; others will be the size of small pebbles. Make a well in the center of the mixture. Add the buttermilk, and use a fork to bring all of the ingredients together. Make sure that every bit of flour is moistened by the buttermilk. The dough will be shaggy.
Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead together about 10 times to bring the dough together. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 10 minutes.
When chilled, cut dough in half. On a lightly floured work surface, with a lightly floured rolling pin, roll out half of the dough. Roll just thinner than 1/8 inch thick. Use a 1 1/2-inch round cookie cutter to cut out crackers, or use a pizza cutter to trim the edges and cut the dough into 1 1/2-inch squares. Prick each cracker with the tines of a fork and place on baking sheet.
Bake crackers for 15 to 18 minutes, until slightly browned around the edges. Remove from the oven and allow to cool completely before placing in an airtight container to store.
Crackers will last, in an airtight container, at room temperature for up to 4 days.

Preheat the oven to 450°F. Bake the pie shell for 5 minutes. Set aside. Decrease the oven temperature to 375°F.
In a saucepan over low heat, melt the butter, salt, cane syrup, and brown sugar, stirring together until smooth, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a mixer bowl and allow to cool thoroughly (so the eggs don't cook in the next step). Add the eggs, vanilla, and rum and beat for 10 minutes at medium-high until fluffy smooth. Add the chopped pecans and pulse a few times until well mixed. Pour the filling into the pie shell and arrange the pecan halves over the top.
Bake for 50 minutes. Cool on a pie rack until well set before slicing.

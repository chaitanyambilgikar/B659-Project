Meanwhile, spread 1 tablespoon mustard on each Boboli. Sprinkle each with 1 1/2 ounces (about 1/3 cup packed) cheese. Arrange 3 ounces corned beef over, folding slices to fit if necessary. Spread 1/2 tablespoon mustard over beef. Arrange 2/3 cup sauerkraut over. Spread 1 1/2 ounces cheese over, pressing to adhere. Sprinkle each with 1/2 teaspoon caraway seeds.
Place pizzas on hot baking sheet. Bake until heated through and cheese on top melts and is beginning to color, about 12 minutes.

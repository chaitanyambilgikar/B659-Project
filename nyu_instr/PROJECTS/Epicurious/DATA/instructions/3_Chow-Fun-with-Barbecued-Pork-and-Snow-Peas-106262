Separate noodles, then toss with 1 teaspoon peanut oil.
Stir together 1/2 cup stock, oyster sauce, soy sauce, sugar, and rice wine.
Heat a wok over high heat until a bead of water dropped onto cooking surface evaporates immediately. Add remaining 1/4 cup peanut oil, swirling wok to coat evenly, and heat until it just begins to smoke. Stir-fry noodles, tossing frequently, until soft and translucent, 3 to 4 minutes (noodles will stick together). Add snow peas and scallions and stir-fry until snow peas are bright green and crisp-tender, about 1 minute. Add pork, garlic, and ginger and stir-fry 1 minute.
Add stock mixture and bring to a boil, stirring, then add remaining 1/4 cup stock. When mixture boils, stir cornstarch mixture and add to wok, then boil, stirring, until sauce is thickened and noodles are well coated, about 30 seconds. Stir in bean sprouts and remove wok from heat. Season with sesame oil and pepper.

Preheat oven to 325°F. Finely grind chocolate cookies in food processor. Add butter and process until crumbs are moist and stick together. Using plastic wrap as aid, firmly press crumbs onto bottom and up sides of 9-inch-diameter deep-dish glass pie plate. Bake crust 10 minutes. Freeze until cold, about 15 minutes.
Spread butterscotch sauce over bottom of crust; freeze until firm, about 15 minutes. Spoon ice cream into crust, pressing to compact and mounding slightly in center. Freeze 15 minutes. Spread fudge topping over ice cream; freeze 5 minutes. Press chopped toffee onto topping. Cover and freeze until very firm, at least 6 hours. (Can be prepared 3 days ahead. Keep frozen.)
Let pie stand at room temperature 15 minutes. Cut into wedges and serve.

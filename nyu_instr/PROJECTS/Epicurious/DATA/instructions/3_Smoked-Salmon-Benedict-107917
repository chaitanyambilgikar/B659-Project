Combine shallots and mustard in medium saucepan. Gradually whisk in wine. Boil over high heat until mixture is reduced to 1/2 cup, whisking often, about 10 minutes. Whisk in cream. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover; chill.)
Fill large bowl with cold water. Bring large skillet of water to boil; add vinegar. Reduce heat to medium-low. Working with 6 whole eggs at a time, crack eggs open and add to simmering water. Cook until whites are set, about 3 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer 1 egg at a time to cold water. Reserve skillet with vinegar water. (Can be prepared 1 hour ahead. Let stand at room temperature.)
Place 2 toast triangles on each of 6 plates. Top with salmon. Bring vinegar water to simmer. Transfer cream sauce to top of double boiler over simmering water. Whisk 3 raw egg yolks into cream sauce. Whisk constantly until sauce thickens and instant-read thermometer inserted into sauce registers 160°F, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat. Add chopped dill and whisk 1 minute. Using slotted spoon, gently transfer poached eggs, 1 at a time, from bowl of cold water to skillet of simmering vinegar water. Cook eggs until warm, about 30 seconds. Using slotted spoon, transfer 1 poached egg to each toast triangle. Spoon sauce over. Garnish with dill sprigs, if desired.

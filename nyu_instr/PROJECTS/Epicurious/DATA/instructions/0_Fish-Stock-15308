Place the fish carcass and all other ingredients in an 8-quart stockpot. Fill the stockpot with water and bring to a gentle simmer over medium heat. When the mixture is simmering, decrease the heat to low and simmer slowly for 1 hour, periodically skimming off any fat and impurities that rise to the surface.
Pour the stock mixture through a fine-mesh strainer. Discard the vegetables and herbs and use the stock as directed.

1. Preheat the oven to 400°F. Grease the cups of a muffin pan with nonstick cooking spray or butter or fill with paper liners.
2. In a medium bowl, stir the cornmeal with the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
3. In another medium bowl, whisk the eggs and buttermilk, then whisk in the butter and honey. Using a rubber spatula or large spoon, stir in the flour mixture until the batter is evenly combined and no dry streaks are visible. Add the raspberries and gently mix until everything is barely blended—to keep the muffins light it's important to not overmix the batter.
4. Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling them equally. Bake until a bamboo skewer or toothpick inserted into the middles of the muffins comes out clean and the tops are golden brown, about 20 minutes. Let cool in the pan for 5 minutes and then use a small paring knife to pop them out of the cups.

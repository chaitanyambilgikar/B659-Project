Preheat the oven to 350°.
Put the sliced apples in a large saucepan with the sugar, apricot preserves, and lemon and orange juices. Simmer over low heat on top of the stove until barely tender, about 15 minutes. Alternatively, cook on 100 percent power in the microwave for 7 minutes, stirring once.
Arrange the fruit mixture in a greased gratin or other oven-to-table dish 10 to 11 inches long and 2 inches deep.
Beat all the topping ingredients together in a bowl until they form a smooth mixture, then spread on top of the apple mixture.
Bake for 40 minutes, or until golden and firm to a gentle touch. Serve plain or with frozen yogurt or ice cream.
Keeps up to 3 days under refrigeration. Freeze leftovers up to 2 months.

Core and peel the apples and cut each into 4 thick slices. [See how to peel and core on streaming video.] Put them in a shallow dish with the sugar and brandy, rum, or liqueur, and turn them so that they are well coated. Leave for at least 1 hour, turning the slices over occasionally, so that they absorb the spirit.
For the batter, beat the yolks with the oil and salt, then stir in the flour and mix well. Now beat in the water gradually and vigorously, squashing any lumps. Leave for an hour, then fold in the stiffly beaten egg whites.
Heat at least 3/4 inch (2 cm) of oil in a large frying pan. Dip the apple slices in the batter — about 5 at a time — making sure that they are well covered with batter. Lift each one out carefully and lower into the hot oil. The oil must be sizzling but not too hot or the fritters will brown before the apple is soft inside. Fry in batches, and turn the slices over to brown both sides. Lift out with a slotted spatula and drain on kitchen paper before serving. Pass the superfine sugar for everyone to sprinkle on.
Variations: • You may use beer or milk instead of water for the batter. • Pass powdered cinnamon and sugar around for people to sprinkle on.

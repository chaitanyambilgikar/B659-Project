Prepare barbecue (medium heat). Stir flour and 1 tablespoon room-temperature butter in small bowl to paste. Boil wine and shallot in heavy medium saucepan until slightly reduced, about 3 minutes. Add cream and black beans and return to boil. Whisk in flour paste; simmer until sauce thickens, about 1 minute. Reduce heat to low. Add chilled butter 1 piece at a time, whisking until butter melts before adding next piece. Whisk in lemon juice. Season sauce with salt and pepper. Remove from heat; cover to keep warm.
Sprinkle steaks on both sides with crushed peppercorns and salt. Grill 5 minutes, then turn and grill to desired doneness, about 4 minutes for medium-rare. Serve steaks with sauce.

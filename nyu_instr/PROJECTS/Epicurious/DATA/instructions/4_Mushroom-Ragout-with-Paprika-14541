Cut white mushrooms lengthwise into 1/2-inch wedges and chop exotic mushrooms. Finely chop shallots.
In a deep 12-inch heavy skillet cook shallots in butter over moderately low heat, stirring, until softened. Add Cognac and cook over moderate heat, stirring, 1 minute. Stir in mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, 2 minutes. Add broth, heavy cream, paprika, and salt and pepper to taste and simmer, stirring occasionally, until liquid is reduced to about 1 1/2 cups, 12 to 15 minutes. (Ragout may be made up to this point 1 day ahead and cooled completely before being chilled, covered. Reheat ragout before proceeding.) Mince parsley. Remove skillet from heat and stir in parsley and sour cream. Heat ragout over moderate heat, stirring, until hot (do not let boil).

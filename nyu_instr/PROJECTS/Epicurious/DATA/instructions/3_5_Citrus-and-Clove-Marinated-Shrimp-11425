In an 8-quart kettle bring water and wine to a boil with lemon, lime, cloves, peppercorns, salt, bay leaf, chilies, and onion and boil 5 minutes. Add shrimp and cook, stirring occasionally, until just cooked through, about 3 minutes. Drain shrimp in a colander and cool 5 minutes.
Make marinade: In a bowl whisk together vinegar, lemon and lime juices, cloves, and salt and pepper to taste and whisk in oil in a stream until marinade is emulsified. Stir in garlic.
In a large glass bowl combine warm shrimp and marinade and cool shrimp completely. Marinate shrimp, covered and chilled, stirring occasionally, 8 hours or overnight.
Serve shrimp with lemon and lime wedges.

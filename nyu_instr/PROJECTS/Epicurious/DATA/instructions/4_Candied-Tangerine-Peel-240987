Remove peel, including a little of pith, from tangerines in (2- by 1-inch) strips with a sharp vegetable peeler (preferably Y-shaped). Cut into thin (1/8-inch) julienne strips.
Cover strips with cold water in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil. Drain in a sieve, then repeat procedure with more cold water 2 times.
Bring granulated sugar, water, and zest strips to a boil in a heavy medium saucepan, stirring until sugar has dissolved, then simmer until zest is translucent and syrup has thickened, 45 to 50 minutes.
Lightly oil a large rack and set over a wax-paper-lined baking sheet. Transfer candied peel to rack with a fork, separating strips. (Discard syrup or reserve for another use.) When peel is cool (but not completely dry), toss with superfine sugar in a bowl to coat. Return to rack until dry to the touch, about 30 minutes.

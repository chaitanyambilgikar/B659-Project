Preheat oven to 375°F. Line baking sheet with foil; butter foil. Mix breadcrumbs, 3 tablespoons sugar and brown sugar in medium bowl. Scatter over prepared baking sheet. Bake until sugar begins to melt and crumbs are slightly darker, stirring crumbs occasionally with metal spatula to prevent sticking, about 10 minutes. Transfer breadcrumbs to bowl and cool. Break crumbs into small pieces.
Place milk in medium saucepan. Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add bean. Bring to simmer. Remove from heat and let steep 30 minutes.
Whisk egg yolks and 5 tablespoons sugar in large bowl to blend. Gradually whisk in milk mixture. Return mixture to same saucepan. Stir over low heat until custard thickens and leaves path on back of spoon when finger is drawn across, about 5 minutes (do not boil). Strain into small bowl. Chill custard until cold, stirring occasionally, about 1 hour.
Beat whipping cream in large bowl until firm peaks form. Fold custard into cream. Gently fold into breadcrumbs. Transfer to covered containers and freeze. (Can be prepared 3 days ahead. Keep frozen.)
Combine strawberries and remaining 6 tablespoons sugar in medium bowl. Let stand until juices form, about 20 minutes. Scoop ice cream into bowls. Spoon strawberries and juices over and serve.

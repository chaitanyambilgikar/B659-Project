Preheat the oven to 375°F. In a bowl whisk together the flour, the baking powder, and the salt. In a bowl with an electric mixer cream together the butter and the sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy, beat in the vanilla and the egg, and beat in the flour mixture in batches alternately with the milk. Chill the dough, dusted with flour and wrapped in plastic wrap, in the freezer for 10 minutes.
Divide the dough into fourths and roll out 1 piece of the dough 1/8 inch thick on a well-floured surface, keeping the remaining pieces covered and chilled. Cut a 4-inch round from the dough, brush off any excess flour, and brush the edges with water. Put 1 tablespoon of the mincemeat in the center of the round, fold the dough over to enclose the mincemeat, and pinch the edges together to seal them. Make 3 more turnovers in the same manner with the remaining dough and mincemeat. Bake the turnovers on a buttered baking sheet in the middle of the oven for 15 minutes, or until the edges are golden.

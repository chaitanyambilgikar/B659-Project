1. To make spiced honey marinade, combine the honey, lime juice, lime zest, and soy sauce in a bowl. Slowly whisk in 1/4 cup of the oil. Stir in grated gingerroot, onion, cumin, coriander, cilantro, and cornstarch. Place locusts in liquid and marinate for 30 minutes.
2. Heat a wok or skillet over medium-high heat until it is nearly smoking. Add 2 tablespoons oil. When the oil is hot, add the garlic. Stir-fry until it is aromatic, then add the locusts. Stir and toss the locusts for 3 to 4 minutes, adding 1-2 tablespoons of marinade if they seem to be drying out. Stir-fry until locusts are just turning golden brown. Remove the locusts from the pan. Drain in a colander or on paper towels.
3. Add 2 tablespoons oil to the wok or skillet. When the oil is hot, add the minced gingerroot. Stir-fry until aromatic, then add the vegetables. Stir-fry for 1 to 2 minutes, until the vegetables are tender but still crisp. Stir in salt and sugar while stir-frying the vegetables, if desired. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons of marinade if the vegetables are drying out during stir-frying.
4. Add 1/2 cup of marinade and bring to a boil. Add the locusts back into the pan. Stir-fry for 2 more minutes to heat through and thoroughly cook the locusts. Serve hot.

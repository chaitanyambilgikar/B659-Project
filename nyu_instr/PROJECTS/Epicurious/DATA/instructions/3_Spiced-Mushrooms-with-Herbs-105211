Finely grind coriander and allspice in an electric coffee/spice grinder or with a mortar and pestle.
Heat oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then sauté mushrooms with spices, stirring occasionally, just until tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Stir in lemon juice, 1 teaspoon of each herb, and salt and pepper. Remove from heat and cool to warm or room temperature. Stir in remaining herbs.

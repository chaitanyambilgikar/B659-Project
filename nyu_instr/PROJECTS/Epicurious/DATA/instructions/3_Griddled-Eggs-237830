1. Place the eggs in a medium saucepan and add cold water to cover by at least 2 inches. Bring the water to a boil, then cover the pan and turn off the heat. Let rest, covered, for 9 minutes. Drain the eggs and cool under cold running water. Peel immediately, or refrigerate for up to 5 days before proceeding.
2. Place a large skillet, either nonstick or well-seasoned cast iron, over medium heat. Add 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and warm for 1 minute. Add the onion and cook and stir until the onion begins to soften, about 1 minute.
3. Halve the eggs lengthwise and place them in the skillet cut side down, pushing aside the onions so that the eggs lay flat against the pan. Cook, sliding the eggs around without turning them over so they cook evenly, until the cut sides are lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Season with the salt and pepper, then turn and cook the rounded side until slightly colored, 1 to 2 minutes.
4. Arrange the eggs, yolk up, on a platter and sprinkle with the cooked onions, parsley leaves, and remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. Season with additional salt and pepper if desired, and serve.

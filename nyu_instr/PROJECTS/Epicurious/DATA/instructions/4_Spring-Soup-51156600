1. Combine all of the ingredients, except the salt, in a large pot and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to low, and simmer, covered, for 40 minutes, or until the vegetables are soft.
2. Taste and season with salt, if desired. Serve the soup immediately. It is best served when freshly madeâ€”the therapeutic value decreases the longer the soup sits.

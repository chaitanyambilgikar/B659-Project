1. Set racks at the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 325°F.
2. Place the chocolates and butter in a bowl or the top of a double boiler and place over hot, not simmering, water. Stir occasionally until the chocolate and butter have melted. Cool.
3. In a bowl, whisk the eggs and sugar until lightened. Whisk in the chocolate mixture and vanilla.
4. Combine the flour, baking powder, and salt. Stir into the chocolate mixture. Stir in the chocolate chips and nuts.
5. Drop tablespoon-size cookies onto the prepared pans. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, until the cookies are slightly firm and cracked.
6. Cool in the pans.
SERVING. Chews are so rich, they are best on their own. Or try making them half size and serving them with ice cream for a really rich treat.
STORAGE. Keep chews at room temperature in a tin or tight-lidded plastic container, or freeze them, packed between sheets of wax paper, for longer storage.

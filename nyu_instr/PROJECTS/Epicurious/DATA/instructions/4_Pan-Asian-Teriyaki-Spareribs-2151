Position rack in middle of oven and preheat to 375°F. Sprinkle ribs with pepper. Wrap each rib rack tightly with heavy-duty foil. Set packets on large rimmed baking sheet. Bake ribs until just tender, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Cool ribs 30 minutes in foil. Unwrap foil. Pour all juices from ribs into medium bowl. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover ribs and pan juices separately and chill.)
Spoon off and discard fat from surface of pan juices. Stir teriyaki baste and next 4 ingredients into pan juices.
Prepare barbecue (medium heat). Place smoke chips in 8x6-inch foil packet with open top. Set packet atop coals about 5 minutes before grilling. Grill ribs until heated through and well glazed, turning and basting often with teriyaki mixture, about 20 minutes total.

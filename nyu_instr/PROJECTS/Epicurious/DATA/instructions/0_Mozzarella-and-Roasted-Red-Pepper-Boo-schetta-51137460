Heat oven to 400°F with rack in middle.
Arrange bread slices on a baking sheet and bake until pale golden, 6 to 12 minutes. Rub tops of slices with cut sides of garlic, then brush each bread slice with oil. Season toasts with salt and pepper and transfer to a wire rack to let cool completely.
Cut mozzarella crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices and trim, if necessary, to fit toasts.
Stir together pesto and mascarpone in a small bowl. If necessary, thin mixture with a little olive oil or water.
Dollop 1/2 teaspoon pesto mixture in center of each mozzarella-covered toast, then top each dollop with an olive slice to form the "irises" of the "eyeballs." Add 6 to 8 pepper slices for "veins," trimming to fit.
Serve within 1 hour of making.

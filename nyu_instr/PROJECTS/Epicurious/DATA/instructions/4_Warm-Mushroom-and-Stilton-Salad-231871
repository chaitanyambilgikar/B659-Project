Chop pancetta. Thinly slice shallots. Brush sand off 1 pound fresh chanterelle mushrooms and cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Crumble Stilton.
Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the pancetta and shallots; sauté until beginning to brown. Add 2 more tablespoons olive oil, then the mushrooms. Sprinkle with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Sauté until the mushrooms are just tender, about 5 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon Sherry wine vinegar and boil until evaporated, stirring constantly. Remove from heat.
Pour lettuce mix into a shallow salad bowl. Add 2 tablespoons olive oil and toss. Add 2 teaspoons Sherry wine vinegar, season with salt and pepper, and toss again. Add the mushrooms and cheese; toss lightly and serve immediately.

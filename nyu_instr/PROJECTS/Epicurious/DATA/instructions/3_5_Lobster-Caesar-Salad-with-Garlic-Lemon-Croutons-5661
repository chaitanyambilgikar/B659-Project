For dressing: Puree all ingredients in blender. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Chill.)
For salad: Cook lobsters in large pot of boiling salted water until just cooked through, about 12 minutes. Using tongs, transfer lobsters to large bowl; cool. Working over bowl, remove meat from tails and claws; reserve 1/4 cup lobster juices from bowl. Cut tail meat in half lengthwise. Whisk reserved juices into dressing; season with salt and pepper.
Arrange half of 1 romaine heart on each of 4 plates. Toss celery root with enough dressing to coat; mound on lettuce. Top with lobster meat; drizzle with dressing. Garnish each salad with grated Parmesan cheese and 3 croutons.

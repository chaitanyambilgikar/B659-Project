Preheat oven to 400°F with a baking sheet on bottom rack.
Stir together sake, soy sauce, ginger, and sugar in a bowl.
If fish fillets are more than 4 inches long, fold ends under. Put a fish fillet in center of each parchment square and season with 1/4 teaspoon salt (total). Working with 1 portion at a time, sprinkle fish with some of scallions and spoon some of sake mixture over top (hold up 2 corners of parchment to prevent liquid from running off). Gather sides of parchment up over fish to form a pouch, leaving no openings, and tie tightly with string.
Bake on hot baking sheet until fish is just cooked through, 10 to 12 minutes.

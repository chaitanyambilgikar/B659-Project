Combine sugar and 2 tablespoons water in heavy medium saucepan. Stir over low heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat; boil without stirring until mixture is deep amber color, occasionally brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush and swirling pan, about 3 minutes.
Add warm cream to caramel. Stir over medium-high heat until sauce is smooth and reduced to 1 1/4 cups, about 5 minutes. Add Cognac and cook 1 minute longer. Remove from heat. Add butter and stir until melted. (Can be prepared 8 hours ahead. Cover and chill. Rewarm over medium-low heat before serving.)
Transfer sauce to small fondue pot or flameproof ceramic bowl. Set pot over candle or canned heat burner. Serve with strawberries, apples or pears, bananas, tangerine segments and star fruit.

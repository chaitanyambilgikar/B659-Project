Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium heat. Add onions and bell pepper; sauté until vegetables begin to soften, about 8 minutes. Add curry powder and stir 1 minute. Add 5 cups broth and next 4 ingredients and bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer 15 minutes to blend flavors, stirring frequently. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cool slightly. Chill until cold, then cover and keep chilled. Rewarm over medium heat, adding more broth if soup is too thick.) Ladle soup into bowls. Top with grated cheese.

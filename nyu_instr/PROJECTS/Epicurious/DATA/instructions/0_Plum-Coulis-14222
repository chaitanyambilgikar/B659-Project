Pit plums and coarsely chop. In a blender purée plums with water and pour through a fine sieve into a bowl, pressing hard on solids. Discard solids. Coulis may be made 2 hours ahead and chilled, covered. Bring coulis to cool room temperature before serving.
Just before serving, add sugar, pepper, and salt to taste.

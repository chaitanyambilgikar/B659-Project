Whisk 1/3 cup dressing and paprika in small bowl to blend. Bring broth and saffron to boil in heavy medium sauce-pan over high heat. Mix in rice. Cover, reduce heat to low and simmer until rice is almost tender, about 15 minutes. Mix in peas. Cover and cook until rice and peas are tender and broth is absorbed, about 5 minutes.
Transfer rice mixture to large bowl. Cool 5 minutes; fluff with fork. Mix in turkey and red bell pepper. Add dressing mixture and toss to blend, adding more purchased dressing by tablespoonfuls, if desired. Season salad with salt and pepper. Serve at room temperature.

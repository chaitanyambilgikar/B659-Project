Preheat oven to 350°F.
In a large bowl with an electric mixer cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add tahini and beat until combined well. Beat in egg, vanilla, and salt. Add flour and beat batter until just combined. Beat in raisins and benne seeds. Spread batter evenly in a buttered jelly-roll pan, 15 1/2 by 10 1/2 by 1 inch, and bake in middle of oven until a tester comes out clean, about 16 to 20 minutes. Let cool in pan on a rack and cut into 36 bars. Bars may be made 3 days in advance and kept in an airtight container.

Heat broiler and move rack close to heat source. Soak wooden skewers in hot water. Combine oil, paprika, sugar, salt and pepper in a bowl. Thread chicken, tangelos and onion on skewers, alternating pieces and packing tightly. Place skewers on a large rimmed baking sheet and brush with oil mixture. Broil, turning once or twice and basting with pan drippings, until chicken is no longer pink inside and tangelos and onion are browned, 7 to 10 minutes.

In a heavy ovenproof kettle combine the duck, the fatback, the wine, the gingerroot, the salt, and the garlic, bring the wine to a boil, stirring, and braise the duck, covered, in a preheated 300°F. oven for 4 hours.
Drain the mixture in a colander set over a bowl and reserve the cooking liquid. Remove and discard the duck skin and bones, transfer the meat and fatback to a large plate, about 1 cup at a time, and shred them with forks, transferring the mixture as it is shredded to a bowl. Stir in the peppercorns and salt and black pepper to taste and transfer the mixture to crocks. Pour enough of the reserved liquid into each crock to cover the mixture by 1/4 inch and let the rillettes cool. The rillettes keep, covered and chilled, for 6 weeks. Serve the rillettes with the toast points.

Prepare a grill or grill pan to medium-high heat.
Grill the pineapple slices for 2 minutes per side, or until tender and grill-marked. Transfer the slices to a cutting board and chop them. Put the chopped pineapple in a medium bowl and stir in the cilantro, serrano chile, and lime juice. Season the salsa to taste with sugar, salt, and pepper. Serve warm.

Halve carrots lengthwise and, using a vegetable peeler along flat side of each half, cut about 18 long wide ribbons. Beginning with the wider end, wind each ribbon around your thumb, securing ends with wooden picks. Chill carrot curls in a bowl of ice and cold water 1 hour.
In a small bowl cream together Saga Blue, celery, and walnuts and drop level teaspoons onto a plate. Chill filling, covered, 45 minutes.
Drain carrot curls. Working with 1 carrot curl at a time, remove wooden pick and pat dry. Beginning with the wider end, wrap each carrot curl around a tablespoon of filling and resecure ends with wooden picks.

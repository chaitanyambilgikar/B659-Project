Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add tomatoes and cook, stirring frequently, until tomatoes begin to burst, about 8 minutes. Add garlic, lemon peel, and dried crushed red pepper; cook 2 minutes longer. Add frisée in batches and cook until wilted, about 3 minutes total. Season tomato-frisée mixture with salt and pepper.
Meanwhile, cook pasta in pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally. Drain, reserving 1 cup cooking liquid.
Add pasta to skillet with tomato-frisée mixture. Stir in butter. Add reserved pasta liquid by 1/4 cupfuls if dry. Divide pasta among shallow bowls and serve, passing cheese separately.

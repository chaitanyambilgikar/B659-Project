Rub the filet well with oil and freshly ground pepper. Place on a rack in a roasting pan and roast in a 350°F. oven for 45-50 minutes, or until the meat thermometer registers 120°F.-125°F. (for rare). Brush with oil occasionally, if necessary. Salt the roast and let it rest for 10 minutes. Remove to a hot platter and blaze with the heated cognac. Sprinkle lavishly with chopped parsley.

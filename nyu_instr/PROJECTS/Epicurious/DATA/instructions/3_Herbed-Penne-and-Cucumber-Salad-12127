In a kettle of boiling salted water cook the penne until it is tender and drain it in a colander. Refresh the pasta with under cold water and drain it well. In a large bowl toss the pasta with the dressing and the cucumber and chill the salad, covered, for 1 hour. The salad may be made 1 day in advance and kept covered and chilled.

Prepare a grill for direct-heat cooking over hot charcoal (high heat for gas); see grilling procedure.
Discard marinade and pat steaks dry.
Oil grill rack, then grill steaks, covered only if using a gas grill, turning occasionally, 6 to 8 minutes total for medium-rare. Let rest on a plate, uncovered, 10 minutes.

Cut the turkey wing into 2 pieces, and the breast into 3 or 4 pieces. Place in large kettle with enough water to cover, and bring to a boil. Add the salt, and simmer for 30 minutes. Meanwhile brown the onion in bacon fat or oil. Add to kettle, along with garlic, chili powder, red pepper, nuts and chocolate. Cover and simmer until turkey is tender and the sauce is well blended and thickened. Correct seasoning. Add olives about ten minutes before serving, if you wish.
Serve with polenta and a cucumber salad.

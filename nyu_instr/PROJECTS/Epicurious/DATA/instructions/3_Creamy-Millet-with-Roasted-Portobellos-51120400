Preheat the oven to 400°F. Rinse and drain the millet. Put it in a heavy pot (enameled cast-iron, if you have one). Add the milk, 2 cups water, and a big pinch of salt. Stir. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce to a gentle simmer, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally so the bottom doesn’t burn, until tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Stir in the nutmeg and thyme and cook another 3 minutes. The consistency should be like that of a soft polenta with some millet nuggets in it. If it starts to thicken too much or the texture is too coarse, add another 1/2 cup water as it cooks. Stir in both cheeses, taste, and add salt and pepper, if desired. Turn off the heat and leave the lid ajar.
In a large bowl, stir together the oil, vinegar, herbes de Provence, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Brush both sides of the mushrooms with the dressing and gently toss the kale with the remaining dressing. Put the mushrooms on a rimmed baking sheet, stem side up. Bake until the mushrooms have shrunk down and softened, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove the baking sheet from the oven, spread the kale in the remaining space, sprinkle with the red pepper flakes, and roast until the kale is just softened and crisped a bit, another 5 minutes.
To serve, place a generous scoop of the cheesy millet on each plate. Top with a portobello, some roasted kale, some Pecorino, and serve.

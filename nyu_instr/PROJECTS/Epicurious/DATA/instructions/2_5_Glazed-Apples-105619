Bring water and 1/2 cup sugar to a boil in a 3-quart saucepan, stirring until sugar is dissolved, then reduce heat and simmer 5 minutes. Add apples and simmer, stirring occasionally, until just tender, about 15 minutes. Transfer apples with a slotted spoon to a rack set over a baking pan, reserving poaching syrup, and drain apples 10 minutes.
Preheat broiler.
Arrange apple wedges in 1 layer in a flameproof shallow baking pan and sprinkle with remaining tablespoon sugar. Broil about 6 inches from heat, rotating pan occasionally and basting twice with poaching syrup, until apples are lightly browned on edges, 3 to 5 minutes.

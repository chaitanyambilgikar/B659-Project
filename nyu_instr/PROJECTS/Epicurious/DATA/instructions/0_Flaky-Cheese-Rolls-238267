Mix cheese and parsley in medium bowl. Season filling with salt and pepper.
If using yufka, place 1 sheet on work surface; keep remaining sheets covered with plastic and damp towel. Shape 1 tablespoon filling into 4- to 5-inch log, 1 inch in from rounded side of wedge. Fold sides in over filling. Starting at filling end, roll toward pointed end, moisten end, and seal, forming cigar. (If using phyllo, shape 1 tablespoon filling into log, 1 inch in from 1 short side. Fold long sides in. Starting at filling end, roll toward opposite end, moisten end, and seal.) Place cigar on baking sheet. Repeat with remaining filling and pastry. Cover with plastic. DO AHEAD Can be made 2 hours ahead. Chill.
Pour oil into large skillet to depth of 1/2 inch. Heat oil to 350°F. Working in batches, fry pastries until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side for yufka and 1 1/2 minutes per side for phyllo. Drain on paper towels; serve.

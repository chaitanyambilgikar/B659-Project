Preheat oven to 325° F.
On a small baking sheet toast almonds in one layer in middle of oven until golden, about 10 minutes, and cool. In a food processor finely grind almonds. Add remaining ingredients and salt and pepper to taste and blend until combined well. Chutney may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.

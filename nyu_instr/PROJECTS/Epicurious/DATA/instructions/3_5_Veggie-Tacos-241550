1. Place the eggplant in a colander and sprinkle with the salt. Let stand for 1 hour. Pat dry with paper towels. Meanwhile, heat 4 tablespoons of the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the eggplant and sauté until almost tender, adding more oil if necessary. Remove to a casserole.
2. Heat the remaining oil in the same skillet over low heat; wilt the onion, garlic and red pepper for 10 minutes, then add to the casserole. Place casserole over low heat and add the ingredients up through the parsley. Cook, uncovered, stirring frequently, for 30 minutes.
3. Stir in the kidney beans and chickpeas; cook for 15 minutes. The skin of the eggplant should be tender. Adjust seasonings.
4. Prepare the tacos: Place 1/4 cup of the cooked veggies in each taco shell. Top with some shredded lettuce and 1 tablespoon each of the onion and tomatoes. Dollop with sour cream and sprinkle with cheese. Serve immediately.

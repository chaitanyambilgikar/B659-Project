Slice off the base of the endive and separate the endive leaves, carefully pulling them off at the base so they're intact.
Lay the leaves on a large servign tray in a decorative pattern — such as concentric circles or diagonal rows.
Fill the base of each leaf (the strongest and whitest part) with a heaping teaspoon of blue cheese crumbles. Sprinkle each with nuts and top with a drop or two of honey.
Now slip into something fabulous.

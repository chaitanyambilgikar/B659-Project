For Sauce: Combine 6 tablespoons butter and 1/4 cup corn syrup in heavy small saucepan. Stir over low heat until well blended. Add semisweet chocolate, 1/4 cup water and instant espresso powder and stir until chocolate melts, espresso dissolves and sauce is smooth. Transfer sauce to small heatproof pitcher.
For Crust: Preheat oven to 350°F. Spray 9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom with nonstick spray. Mix cookie crumbs, butter and espresso in medium bowl. Press crumb mixture firmly onto bottom and up sides of prepared tart pan. Bake until crust looks dry and feels firm to touch, about 20 minutes. cool crust completely.
Meanwhile, using ice cream scoop, scoop chocolate ice cream into balls and arrange in single layer on baking sheet; freeze until firm. Using clean scoop, scoop coffee ice cream into balls and arrange in single layer on another baking sheet; freeze until firm.
In cooled crust, alternate chocolate and coffee ice cream balls in single tightly packed layer. Form second layer, then third layer of ice cream balls, mounding in center. Drizzle 1/2 cup mocha sauce over. Freeze tart until ice cream and sauce topping are firm, about 2 hours. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover tart and keep frozen. Cover sauce and let stand at room temperature.)
Gently press up pan bottom to loosen crust; remove pan sides. Transfer ice cream tart to platter. Let stand 15 minutes to soften slightly. Press cookies upright into ice cream, if desired. Cut tart into wedges. Serve, passing remaining sauce separately.

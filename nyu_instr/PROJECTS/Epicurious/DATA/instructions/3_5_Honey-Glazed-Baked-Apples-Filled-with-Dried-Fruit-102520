Preheat oven to 350°F. Cut a thin slice from the bottom of each apple so that apples will stand upright. Place apples in 9-inch-diameter glass pie dish or 8x8x2-inch glass baking dish. Fill cored-out section of each apple with 2 tablespoons dried fruit bits. Pour apple juice around apples in dish. Drizzle honey over dried fruit filling and apples.
Bake apples until tender when pierced with skewer, basting frequently with pan juices, about 55 minutes. Serve warm, spooning pan juices over.

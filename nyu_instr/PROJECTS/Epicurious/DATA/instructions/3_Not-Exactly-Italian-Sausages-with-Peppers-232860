1. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the sausages and cook, stirring occasionally, until they are lightly browned, about 3 minutes.
2. Add the onions, bell peppers, and garlic. Cook, stirring often, until the vegetables soften, about 6 minutes. Add the tomatoes, basil, and oregano. Cook, stirring often, until the tomatoes and sausage are heated through, about 5 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper. Serve hot.

1 Heat a dry grill pan over medium-high heat. Grill the corn, turning occasionally, until darkened in spots, about 10 minutes. Set aside until it is cool enough to handle.
2 Using a sharp knife, carefully cut the kernels off the cobs and add them to a medium bowl. Mix in the tomatoes, onion, cilantro, lime juice, and serrano. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and chill for at least 30 minutes, until flavors blend. (The salsa can be made up to 4 hours ahead.)

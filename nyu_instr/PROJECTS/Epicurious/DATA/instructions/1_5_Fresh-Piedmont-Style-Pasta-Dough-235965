Mound flour on a work surface and make a large well in center. Crack whole eggs into center of well and add yolks, salt, and oil (if using). Beat egg mixture with a fork until well blended, then continue to beat egg mixture, incorporating flour a little at a time, starting with the inside wall of well and keeping wall intact by supporting outside with other hand.
When you have a thick paste, begin to mix flour with your hands. When dough begins to take shape but is still quite soft and moist, transfer it to a clean area of work surface. Using pastry scraper, scrape up remaining flour and transfer it to a sieve, then sift flour over dough, discarding any bits of dough. Knead enough of flour into dough to allow it to form a soft ball.
Brush remaining flour on work surface to the side and knead dough, flouring surface as needed to keep dough from sticking, until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Lightly dust dough with flour, then wrap in plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature 1 hour.

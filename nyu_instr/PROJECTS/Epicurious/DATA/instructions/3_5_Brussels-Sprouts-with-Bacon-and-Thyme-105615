Cook Brussels sprouts in a 4-quart pot of boiling salted water until crisp-tender, about 6 minutes, then drain in a colander. Cook bacon in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat, stirring, until browned and crisp, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to moderate and stir in Brussels sprouts, thyme, salt, and pepper, then cook, stirring, 3 minutes.

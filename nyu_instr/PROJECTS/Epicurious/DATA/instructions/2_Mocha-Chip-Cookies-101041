Preheat oven to 375°F. Mix both flours and baking soda in medium bowl. Using electric mixer, beat butter and both sugars in large bowl until light. Beat in eggs, coffee powder and vanilla. Beat in flour mixture. Stir in chocolate chips and nuts.
Drop dough by tablespoonfuls onto ungreased baking sheets, spacing 2 inches apart. Bake until golden brown but still soft, about 9 minutes. Cool on sheets 2 minutes. Transfer to racks and cool.

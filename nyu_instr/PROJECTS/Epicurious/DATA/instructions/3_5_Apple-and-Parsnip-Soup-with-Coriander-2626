Melt butter in heavy large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add apples, parsnips, onion and coriander and sauté until slightly softened, about 12 minutes. Add 4 cups broth and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover and simmer until apples and parsnips are tender, about 40 minutes.
Puree soup in blender in batches. Return puree to saucepan. Thin with more broth if desired. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Rewarm over medium heat before continuing.) Season soup with salt and pepper. Ladle into bowls. Sprinkle with parsley; garnish with apple slices if desired and serve.

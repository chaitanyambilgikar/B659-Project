For gazpacho: Combine first 8 ingredients and 1 teaspoon coarse salt in processor. Blend to almost smooth puree (some texture should remain). Season with pepper and more salt, if desired. Transfer to medium bowl. Cover; chill at least 3 hours and up to 1 day.
For sandwiches: Cut each bread slice into rectangle (about 4 1/2 x 2 1/2 inches). Arrange 4 bread rectangles on work surface. Top bread with half of cheese slices (trimming to fit) and 2 tomato slices. Sprinkle tomatoes with salt and pepper. Top with remaining cheese, then remaining bread; press to compact.
Melt butter in large skillet over medium heat. Add sandwiches. Cover and cook until bread is golden, turning once, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer sandwiches to paper towels. Cut each sandwich in half.
Divide gazpacho among 4 bowls; place on plates. Arrange sandwiches alongside.

Cook noodles and peas together in a 6- to 8-quart pot of lightly salted boiling water until noodles are tender, 4 to 6 minutes.
While noodles cook, whisk together scallions, oil, lemon juice, soy sauce, sugar, salt, and pepper in a large bowl.
Drain noodles and peas well in a colander, then rinse under cold running water to stop cooking. Drain well again, then add to dressing along with feta. Grind pepper to taste over salad.
*Can be found in natural food stores, Japanese markets, and many supermarkets.

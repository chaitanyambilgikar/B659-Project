Preheat the oven to 325°F. Line four half-sheet pans with parchment paper.
Combine the all-purpose flour, red fife flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and lemon zest in a medium bowl, and set aside.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar. Combine the eggs with the vanilla and add slowly to the creamed batter. With a silicone spatula, fold in the flour mixture and mix just until combined.
Using a tablespoon-size ice-cream scoop, drop the batter onto the prepared pans, spacing the cookies 2 inches apart. (They are very buttery and will run if placed too closely together.) Press the pumpkin seeds onto the cookies. Bake for 5 minutes. Turn the pans in the oven and bake for 5 more minutes. Cool completely on wire racks. Sprinkle confectioners' sugar on top of the cooled cookies.

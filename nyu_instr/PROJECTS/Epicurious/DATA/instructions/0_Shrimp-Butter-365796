In a 12" skillet, caramelize onion, garlic cloves, and thyme in unsalted butter. Toss in shrimp; cook slowly until golden. Transfer to a food processor and purée until smooth; with processor running, add softened butter, 1 Tbsp. at a time. Force through a fine-mesh strainer. Season with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. For a super-fine texture, strain again.

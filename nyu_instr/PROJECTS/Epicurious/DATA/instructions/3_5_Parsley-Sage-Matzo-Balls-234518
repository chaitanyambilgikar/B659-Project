Whisk eggs in medium bowl until frothy. Whisk in melted margarine, salt, and pepper, then herbs. Gradually mix in matzo meal. Stir in club soda. Cover and chill batter until cold and firm, at least 2 hours and up to 1 day.
Line baking sheet with plastic wrap. Using wet hands and 1 heaping teaspoonful for each, shape batter into matzo balls. Arrange on prepared sheet.
Drop matzo balls into large pot of boiling salted water. Cover partially and reduce heat to medium. Simmer until matzo balls are tender, about 1 hour. Using slotted spoon, transfer matzo balls to clean baking sheet. (Can be made ahead. Let stand at room temperature 2 hours or cover and chill up to 1 day. Rewarm in soup before serving.)

In large sealable plastic bag, combine chives, basil, tarragon, parsley, 2 tablespoons mint, garlic, and 3/4 cup olive oil. Add salmon and seal bag, pressing out air. Turn bag to coat salmon, then refrigerate, turning bag over occasionally, at least 1 hour and up to 4 hours. (Alternatively, marinate salmon in large glass baking dish.)
Preheat grill to moderate heat.
Remove fish from marinade and pat dry. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill steaks, turning once, until just opaque in center, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer to platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm.
In 6-quart heavy stock pot over moderate heat, heat remaining 1/2 cup olive oil until hot but not smoking. Add fennel and onion and sauté until just soft, about 2 minutes. Add wine, butter, saffron, remaining 1/2 cup mint, and clams, cover and bring to boil. Cook until clams open, about 10 minutes. Discard any clams that have not opened.
Place 1 piece salmon on center of each of 8 wide shallow bowls. Spoon clams, broth, onions, and fennel around salmon and serve immediately.

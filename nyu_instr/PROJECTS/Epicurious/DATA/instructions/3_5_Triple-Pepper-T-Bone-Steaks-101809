Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Blend first 5 ingredients in small bowl. Sprinkle steaks on both sides with salt. Spread 1/4 of pepper sauce over 1 side of each steak. Place steaks, sauce side down, on grill. Spread top of steaks with remaining sauce. Grill steaks until cooked to desired doneness, about 5 minutes per side for medium-rare. Transfer steaks to plates.

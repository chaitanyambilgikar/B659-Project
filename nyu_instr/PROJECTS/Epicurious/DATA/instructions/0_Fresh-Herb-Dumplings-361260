Whisk first 7 ingredients, 1 teaspoon coarse salt, and pepper in large bowl until blended. Whisk in flour (batter will be soft).
Bring large pot of water to boil. Stir in 1 1/2 tablespoons coarse salt. Working with half of batter at a time, quickly add dumpling batter to pot by teaspoonfuls, submerging teaspoon with batter into boiling water each time and shaking spoon to dislodge batter. Cook dumplings at gentle boil until just tender (do not overcook), about 8 minutes per batch. Using large skimmer, transfer dumplings to large rimmed baking sheet. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Cool, cover, and chill.

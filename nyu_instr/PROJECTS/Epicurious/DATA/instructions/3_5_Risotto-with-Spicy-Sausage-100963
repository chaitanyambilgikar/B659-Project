Sauté sausage, onion and garlic in heavy large saucepan over medium heat until onion is tender, breaking up sausage with spoon, about 8 minutes. Add rice and stir 1 minute. Add 4 cups broth. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until broth is absorbed, stirring frequently, about 15 minutes. Continue to simmer until rice is just tender and mixture is creamy, adding more broth 1/4 cup at a time and stirring frequently, about 6 minutes longer. Mix in 1/4 cup cheese and 1/4 cup parsley. Season with salt and pepper.
Transfer risotto to large bowl. Sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup parsley. Pass remaining 1 cup cheese separately.

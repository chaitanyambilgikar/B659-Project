Square off curved side of cheese wedge with a knife so it fits slicer, then slice cheese into generous 1/8-inch-thick rectangles (about 8). Arrange in 1 layer on a sheet of parchment or wax paper.
Cut quince paste into 1/16-inch-thick rectangular slices with slicer or a knife and put on top of Manchego slices, piecing quince-paste slices together to cover cheese evenly. Make "napoleons" by stacking 2 cheese/paste layers together. Press almonds decoratively into quince paste on top.
Cut stacks into serving pieces (about 1 1/2- by 1/2-inch rectangles or 1-inch squares), trimming edges.

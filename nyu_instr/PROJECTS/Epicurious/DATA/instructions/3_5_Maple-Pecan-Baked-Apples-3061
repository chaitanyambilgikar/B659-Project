Preheat oven to 375°F. Core apples. Peel top third of each apple. Using small sharp knife, cut 1/4-inch-deep line all around each where peel and flesh meet. Using small sharp knife, cut about 1 1/4-inch-wide, 1-inch-deep hollow in top of each apple. Cut off thin slice from bottom of each to allow apples to stand flat. Place apples in 13x9x2-inch glass baking dish.
Finely chop 2/3 cup pecans, raisins and coconut in processor. Transfer to small bowl. Mix in maple syrup, lemon peel, cinnamon and nutmeg. Divide filling equally among hollows in apples.
Spread 1 tablespoon preserves over top of each apple and into hollows. Press 1 tablespoon chopped pecans atop each.
Combine apple juice and butter in small saucepan. Stir over medium heat until butter melts. Pour into dish around apples. Cover dish loosely with foil. Bake apples 30 minutes. Remove foil; bake until apples are tender, basting with juices every 10 minutes, about 35 minutes longer. Serve apples warm with pan juices.

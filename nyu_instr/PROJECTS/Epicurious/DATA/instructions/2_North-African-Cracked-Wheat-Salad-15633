In a large bowl, combine the cracked wheat, lemon juice, and oil. Mix well. Add the tomatoes, red peppers, green peppers, cucumbers, celery, scallions, parsley, and mint. Season with the salt and black pepper. Toss well to combine.
Cover and refrigerate for at least 8 hours, or until the wheat has softened.

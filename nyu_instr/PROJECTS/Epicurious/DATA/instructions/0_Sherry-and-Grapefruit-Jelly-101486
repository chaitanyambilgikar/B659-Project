Mix gelatin and sugar in a pan, add water and cook over a low fire, stirring, until gelatin is completely dissolved. Remove from fire and add lime juice, sherry, Angostura bitters, and grapefruit juice. Pour into 8 individual molds and chill until firm. To serve, unmold on dessert dishes, garnish with grapefruit sections and dust lightly with grated orange rind. Serve with sherry-flavored whipped cream.

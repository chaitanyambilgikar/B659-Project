1. Place a plate lined with wax paper in the freezer for 10 minutes.
2. With a small ice cream scoop or a melon baller, quickly scoop small balls of the ice cream, using about 1 tablespoon for each; make 3 or 4 at a time, placing them on a plate, then transferring them to the plate in the freezer. Freeze for at least 30 minutes, or until firm.
3. Pulse the wafers in a food processor until finely ground. Transfer to a sheet of wax paper.
4. Working quickly, roll the ice cream balls in the ground wafers to coat completely. Return to the wax-paper-lined plate, cover with plastic wrap, and freeze for at least 30 minutes, or up to 2 days.
5. Serve in foil bonbon cups, if desired, or simply arranged on small plates.

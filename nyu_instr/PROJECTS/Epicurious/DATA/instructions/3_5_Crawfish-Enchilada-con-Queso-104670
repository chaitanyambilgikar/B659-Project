1. Heat oven to 350°F. Heat lard and chili powder in a 10-inch skillet. Add onion, red pepper, and celery. Cook, stirring frequently, until soft, about 5 minutes. Add corn flour and stir to combine. Add cream and stock. Bring to a boil, and reduce heat to simmer. Add cheddar cheese and stir to combine. Add crawfish and green onions. Season with salt and pepper.
2. Meanwhile, heat vegetable oil in a large skillet. Add tortillas, one at a time, to soften. Remove to a plate lined with paper towels to drain.
3. Place tortilla in shallow baking dish. Using a slotted spoon, fill tortilla with crawfish mixture and roll to seal. Repeat with remaining ingredients. Pour over cream mixture. Top with grated Monterey Jack. Transfer to oven and cook until cheese is melted and bubbly, 15 to 20 minutes.
4. Remove from oven. Place on a rack to cool and set, about 5 minutes. Serve immediately with salsa.

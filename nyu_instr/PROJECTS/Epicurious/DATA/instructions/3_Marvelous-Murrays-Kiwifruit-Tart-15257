Reserve a quarter of dough for another use. On a floured surface with a floured rolling pin roll out remaining dough into a 14-inch round (about 1/8 inch thick) and fit into an 11- by 1 1/4-inch round tart pan with a removable fluted rim. Trim dough flush with rim. (Don't worry if dough cracks; press dough together to patch any holes.) Prick shell lightly all over with a fork. Chill shell, covered, 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 425°F.
Line shell with foil and fill with pie weights or raw rice. Bake shell in middle of oven 15 minutes and remove weights or rice. Bake shell until pale golden, about 10 minutes more, and transfer to a rack to cool.
Reduce temperature to 350°F.
Chop hazelnuts. Peel kiwifruits and quarter lengthwise. Halve vanilla bean half lengthwise and scrape seeds into a small saucepan, reserving pod for another use. Add butter and melt over moderately low heat until golden brown. Cool mixture to room temperature.
Into a small bowl sift flour. In a bowl with an electric mixer beat eggs with sugar and rum until thick and pale. Fold in flour gently but thoroughly. Fold butter into egg mixture gently but thoroughly.
Arrange kiwifruits evenly in one layer in tart shell and pour filling over them, spreading evenly. Sprinkle hazelnuts over filling and bake in middle of oven 35 minutes, or until top is golden. Cool tart in pan on a rack.

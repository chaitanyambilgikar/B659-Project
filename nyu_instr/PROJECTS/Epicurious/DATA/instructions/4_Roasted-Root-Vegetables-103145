Preheat oven to 375°F. Combine first 5 ingredients in large bowl. Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. Add olive oil and toss to coat. Spread vegetables out on large rimmed baking sheet. Roast vegetables until almost tender, stirring occasionally, about 50 minutes. Mix green onions and stock into vegetables. Bake until vegetables are just tender, about 15 minutes longer.

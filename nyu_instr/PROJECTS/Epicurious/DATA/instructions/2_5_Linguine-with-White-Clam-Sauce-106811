1. Wash clams thoroughly. To clean and remove any dirt, place clams in a bowl of cold water and run cold water gently over them for 5 minutes; drain. Place in a large pot; add the wine.
2. Thinly slice one shallot and finely chop the other; reserve. Add the sliced shallot, garlic and bay leaves to the pot. Boil, cover, and simmer 5 minutes or until the clams open. (Discard any clams that don't open.) Remove and discard bay leaves.
3. Remove the clams to a bowl with a slotted spoon; reserve. Add the lemon juice and chopped shallots to the pot. Cook for 1 minute to meld the flavors in the sauce. Stir in the butter, tomatoes, and chopped tarragon leaves.
4. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the linguine and cook until just tender. Drain well and mix with the sauce in the pot. Add the clams and chopped parsley; toss together over low heat to warm through. Serve in a large pasta bowl.

1. Preheat oven to 425°F.
2. Rinse chicken inside and out, then pat dry. Remove excess fat from the cavities and season with salt and pepper. Place half of the lemon inside. Tie legs together with kitchen string and place in a roasting pan.
3. In a saucepan, melt the butter with the olive oil over low heat. Squeeze the remaining lemon half into the mixture. Brush over the chicken. Season with salt and pepper. Bake in the center of the oven, basting often with the drippings, until juices run clear when the thigh is pierced with a sharp knife, about 1 hours. The temperature should be 175°F when a meat thermometer is placed in the thickest part of the thigh.
4. Remove chicken from the oven and transfer to a carving board; let rest for 10 minutes. Remove the lemon from the cavity and squeeze it into the pan juices. Stir in the water. Bring the pan juices to a low boil, scraping up the brown bits, and cook until the sauce is reduced, about 2 minutes. Defat the sauce.
5. Carve the chicken and arrange on a large platter. Pour the sauce over it and garnish with watercress. Serve immediately.

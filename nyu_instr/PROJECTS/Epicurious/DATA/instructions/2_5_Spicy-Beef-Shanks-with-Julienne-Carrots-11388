Preheat oven to 275°F.
In a heavy ovenproof kettle large enough to hold beef shanks in one layer arrange shanks and season with salt and pepper. Roast meat, covered tightly, in middle of oven 2 1/2 hours, or until tender. (Meat will give off juices as it cooks.)
Stir Worcestershire sauce into pan juices and cool meat, covered partially, basting it as it cools. Transfer meat with a slotted spoon to a platter and discard bones and gristle. Skim fat from pan juices. Return meat to pan juices and heat, covered partially, over moderate heat until just heated through.
In a steamer set over simmering water steam carrots, covered, 3 minutes, or until crisp-tender, and transfer to a bowl. Toss carrots with butter, horseradish, parsley, and salt and pepper to taste.
Divide carrots among 4 plates, mounding slightly, and arrange meat over them. Drizzle meat with pan juices.

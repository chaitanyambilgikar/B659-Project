Reserve 1/2 cup broth. Combine remaining broth and 2 cups water in heavy medium saucepan and bring to simmer. Remove from heat. Cover to keep warm. Heat olive oil in large saucepan over medium heat. Add green onions; sauté 1 minute. Add rice; sauté 2 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons Sherry and stir until absorbed. Add 3/4 cup warm broth mixture and stir until liquid is absorbed. Continue adding remaining broth mixture, 3/4 cup at a time, stirring occasionally, until rice is tender, about 30 minutes. Season risotto with salt and pepper.
Meanwhile, melt butter in large skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle livers with salt and pepper and dust with flour. Add livers to skillet and sauté until pink in center, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to plate. Add 1/4 cup Sherry and reserved 1/2 cup broth to skillet. Boil until reduced to glaze, stirring up any browned bits, about 4 minutes. Return livers to skillet and stir to coat. Divide risotto among plates; spoon livers and pan juices over. Drizzle with truffle oil.

Preheat oven to 350°F. Spray large baking sheet with vegetable oil spray. Finely grind 1/2 cup toasted pine nuts with sugar and flour in processor. Transfer to bowl. Mix in butter, egg whites and vanilla.
Form 3 cookies by spooning 1 tablespoonful batter for each onto prepared baking sheet, spacing 4 inches apart. Using knife, spread each to 4-inch round. Sprinkle each round with 1 teaspoon untoasted pine nuts.
Bake cookies until golden around edges, about 10 minutes. Working quickly, run thin metal spatula around edges of cookies to loosen. Drape each cookie over inverted 3/4-cup custard cup, molding and crimping sides of cookie to shape (cookie cups will be shallow). Transfer cookies to rack. Repeat with remaining batter and untoasted nuts, spraying baking sheet with vegetable oil spray between batches. Cool before using. (Can be prepared 3 days ahead. Store at room temperature in airtight container.)

Preheat oven to 475°F.
Stack won ton wrappers and cut into 1/4-inch-wide strips. In a small bowl toss strips with salt and pepper to taste and arrange, overlapping slightly, in one layer on a non-stick baking sheet. Bake strips in middle of oven, stirring strips and breaking them up into large clusters halfway through baking, until golden brown and slightly crisp, about 6 minutes total.
Transfer strips to a plate to cool and season with salt (strips will continue to crisp as they cool). (Strips may be made 2 days ahead, cooled completely, and kept in an airtight container at room temperature.)

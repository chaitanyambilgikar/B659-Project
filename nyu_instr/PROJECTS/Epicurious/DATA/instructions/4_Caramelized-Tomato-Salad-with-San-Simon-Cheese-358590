Preheat oven to 275°F. Place oil, 3/4 pound tomatoes, sugar, and thyme in 8 x 8 x 2-inch metal baking dish. Roast until tomatoes are very tender, about 2 1/2 hours. Cool caramelized tomatoes in oil. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 days ahead; cover and chill. Bring to room temperature before continuing.
Using slotted spoon, transfer tomatoes to large bowl. Transfer 1 cup oil from tomatoes to medium bowl (reserve any remaining oil for another use). Add vinegar to oil in medium bowl; whisk to blend. Season dressing with salt and pepper.
Add 1 pound fresh tomatoes, cheese, and dressing to bowl with caramelized tomatoes; toss gently. Top with green onions and chervil. Serve with toasts.

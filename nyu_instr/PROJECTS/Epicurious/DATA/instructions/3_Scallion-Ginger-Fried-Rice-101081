Finely chop enough scallions to measure about 3 cups. Rinse bean sprouts and trim stringy root ends if desired.
Make seasoning liquid: In a small bowl stir together seasoning liquid ingredients.
Spread rice in a shallow baking pan and separate grains with a fork.
In a deep 12-inch heavy non-stick skillet heat corn or safflower oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and stir-fry scallions and gingerroot until fragrant, about 20 seconds. Add bean sprouts and rice wine or sake and stir-fry until sprouts begin to soften, about 1 minute. Add rice and cook, stirring frequently, 2 to 3 minutes, or until heated through. Stir seasoning liquid and add to fried rice, tossing to coat evenly.

Make goat cheese blossoms: Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 375°F. Brush muffin cups with some melted butter.
Stir together goat cheese, cream, egg, mustard, and pepper in a bowl until combined well.
Cover phyllo with 2 overlapping sheets of plastic wrap and then a dampened kitchen towel. Arrange 1 sheet of phyllo on a work surface, then brush with some melted butter. Cut phyllo into 4 (8 1/2- by 6-inch) rectangles and arrange 2 of them one over the other in a crisscross pattern, then line a muffin cup with overlapping phyllo. Line another muffin cup with remaining 2 phyllo rectangles in same manner. Repeat procedure with remaining 2 phyllo sheets and melted butter, lining remaining 4 muffin cups.
Spoon goat cheese filling into cups and loosely gather edges of phyllo over center (if pieces of phyllo break off, arrange in center).
Bake phyllo blossoms until tops are golden brown and sides are golden, 25 to 35 minutes, then transfer from pan to a rack to cool slightly.
Prepare salad while goat cheese blossoms bake: Cook bacon in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until browned and crisp, about 12 minutes. If necessary pour off all but 1 tablespoon fat. Add oil and shallot to skillet and cook, stirring, until softened, about 2 minutes. Add vinegar, quickly stirring and scraping up brown bits, then stir in sugar and salt. Immediately pour hot dressing and bacon over dandelion greens in a large bowl and toss well.
Divide salad among plates and put a warm goat cheese blossom alongside each salad. Serve immediately.

Wash spinach well, discarding coarse stems, and drain in a colander. In a wok or large heavy skillet heat oil over moderately high heat until very hot but not smoking and stir-fry gingerroot and garlic until fragrant, 10 to 15 seconds. Add spinach and stir-fry until wilted, about 1 minute. Season spinach with salt and pepper.

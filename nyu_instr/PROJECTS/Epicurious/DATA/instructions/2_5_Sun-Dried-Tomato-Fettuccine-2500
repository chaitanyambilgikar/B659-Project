Place sun-dried tomatoes in small bowl. Add enough boiling water to just cover tomatoes. Let stand until tomatoes are soft, about 1 minute. Drain. Coarsely chop tomatoes.
Heat olive oil in heavy small skillet. Add sun-dried tomatoes, garlic and dried crushed red pepper. Sauté until garlic is just golden, about 3 minutes. Transfer mixture to large bowl. Add spaghetti and 1 cup Parmesan. Toss well. Sprinkle with pine nuts. Serve, passing additional parmesan separately.

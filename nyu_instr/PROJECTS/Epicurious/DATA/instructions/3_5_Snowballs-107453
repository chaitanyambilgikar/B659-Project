Preheat oven to 350°F.
Pulse sweetened and unsweetened coconuts, granulated sugar, and salt together in a food processor until flaked coconut is finely chopped. Add whites and water and pulse until mixture is moistened and holds together when squeezed.
Roll level tablespoons of coconut mixture into balls with wet hands (you'll need to rinse your hands every 3 or 4 balls). Make an indentation in center of each ball and insert a piece of chocolate, then pinch hole closed and reroll into a ball. Arrange balls 1 inch apart on a parchment-lined large baking sheet.
Bake macaroons in middle of oven until bottoms are golden and balls are puffed but still white, 13 to 15 minutes. Slide macaroons on parchment to a rack to cool completely, then peel off paper. Dust macaroons lightly with confectioners sugar just before serving.

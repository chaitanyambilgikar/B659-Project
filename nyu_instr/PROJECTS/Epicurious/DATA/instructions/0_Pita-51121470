1. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a hook attachment, add the flour, yeast, sugar, salt, and water. Mix on low speed for 1 minute to combine the ingredients, then increase the speed to medium and continue mixing until the dough is smooth and elastic, about 4 minutes more.
2. Divide the dough into 12 equal portions (or, for smaller pitas, 24 equal portions) and shape each into a smooth ball. Place the dough balls on a lightly floured surface and cover with a slightly damp towel.
3. Roll each round into a disc about 1/4-inch thick (about 3 1/2 inches in diameter for small pitas or 5 inches for larger ones). As each pita is rolled, carefully place it on a floured surface and cover with a clean, dry towel to keep the surface from drying out. Allow the discs to rise in a warm, draft-free area until puffed, about 45 minutes.
4. To bake, preheat the oven to 450°F with a pizza stone; if you don't have a pizza stone, place a sheet pan in the oven to heat up with the oven. Gently press your fingers into the surface of each pita to press a little of the air out. Put the dough directly on the stone (or sheet pan) and bake until the bottom is golden brown and bread is slightly puffed in the middle, about 5 minutes.
5. Remove hot pitas from the oven and wrap immediately in clean, dry towels to serve warm.

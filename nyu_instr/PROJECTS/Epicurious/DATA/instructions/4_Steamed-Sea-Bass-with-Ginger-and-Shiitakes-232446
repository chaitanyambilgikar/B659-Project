Bring water to a boil under a metal or bamboo steamer. Sprinkle sea bass with salt, black pepper, and cayenne; place on a piece of parchment paper inside steamer. Top with ginger and shiitakes, cover and steam 15 minutes. Remove fish and place on a plate. Sprinkle cilantro and green onions on fish; drizzle with juices from parchment. In a small sauté pan, heat oil over medium heat for 1 to 2 minutes or until smoking. Pour some oil over each fillet to wilt cilantro and green onions. Drizzle plates with soy sauce.

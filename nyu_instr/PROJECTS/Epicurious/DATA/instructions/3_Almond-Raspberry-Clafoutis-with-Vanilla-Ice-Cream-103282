Puree frozen raspberries with their syrup in processor until smooth. (Raspberry sauce can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
Preheat oven to 350°F. Finely grind almonds in processor. Transfer almonds to large bowl. Add sugar, egg whites, flour, orange juice and orange peel and whisk to blend well.
Melt butter in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat; cook until butter browns, stirring frequently, about 4 minutes. Whisk hot browned butter into almond batter until well blended. Divide batter equally among six 1 1/4-cup custard cups (batter will fill cups only halfway). Drop 8 raspberries into batter in each cup. Bake clafoutis until golden brown and set in center, about 40 minutes. Cool 15 minutes. Serve warm with raspberry sauce and vanilla ice cream, if desired. Garnish clafoutis with any remaining fresh raspberries and serve immediately.

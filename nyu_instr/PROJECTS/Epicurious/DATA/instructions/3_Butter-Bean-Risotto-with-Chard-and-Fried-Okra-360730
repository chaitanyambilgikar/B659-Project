For fried okra: Preheat oven to 375°F. Place okra in small bowl; pour buttermilk over. Let stand 15 minutes. Drain off buttermilk.
Place cornmeal in medium bowl. Mix in salt and pepper. Add okra; toss to coat.
Heat oil in small saucepan over medium-high heat. Add okra; sauté until brown on all sides, about 4 minutes. Transfer to baking sheet. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature. Rewarm in 375°F oven 5 minutes before using.
For risotto: Heat oil in heavy medium skillet over medium heat. Add chard and toss until wilted and tender, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside.
Bring broth to simmer in large saucepan over medium heat. Reduce heat to very low and keep broth warm.
Melt 1 tablespoon butter in medium saucepan over medium heat. Add onion; sauté until soft but not brown, about 2 minutes. Add rice; stir to coat well, about 3 minutes. Add wine; simmer until wine evaporates, stirring constantly, about 1 minute. Add 1 cup broth. Simmer until absorbed, stirring almost constantly, about 2 minutes. Continue to add broth, 1/2 cup at a time, simmering until broth is absorbed each time and rice is creamy and just tender, stirring almost constantly, about 18 minutes longer. Mix in chard, then beans, 1 tablespoon Parmesan, and 1 tablespoon butter. Season risotto with salt and pepper.
Divide risotto among bowls; sprinkle with okra. Pass more Parmesan alongside.

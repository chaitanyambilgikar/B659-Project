Trim root ends of radishes so radishes will stand upright and cut 1/4 inch from stem ends. With a small melon-ball cutter scoop out center of each radish, leaving a 1/3-inch-thick shell.
In a small bowl whisk together cream cheese, lemon juice, chives, and salt and pepper to taste. With a small knife fill radishes with cream cheese mixture.

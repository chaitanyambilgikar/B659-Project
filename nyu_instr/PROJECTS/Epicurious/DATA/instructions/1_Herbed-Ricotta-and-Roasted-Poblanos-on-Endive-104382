Lay chiles on their sides on rack of a gas burner and turn flame on high. (Or put chiles on rack of broiler pan about 2 inches from heat.) Roast chiles, turning with tongs, until skins are blackened, 5 to 8 minutes. Transfer chiles to a bowl and let stand, covered, 15 minutes.
While chiles stand, stir together ricotta, scallions, cilantro, mint, and salt.
Rub skins off chiles with paper towels and discard stems and seeds (if desired, devein to further reduce heat). Finely chop chiles and stir into ricotta mixture. Spoon some of mixture onto base of each endive leaf.

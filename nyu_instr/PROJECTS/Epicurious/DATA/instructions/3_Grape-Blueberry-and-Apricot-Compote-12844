In a saucepan combine the grape juice, the wine, 1/4 cup water, the honey, the vanilla bean, and the nutmeg and boil the mixture for 2 minutes. Add the blueberries and the apricots and simmer the mixture for 1 minute. Add the grapes and simmer the mixture for 2 minutes. Transfer the fruit with a slotted spoon to a bowl. Remove the vanilla bean, scrape the seeds into the syrup, and boil the syrup for 2 to 3 minutes, or until it is thickened slightly. Stir in the lime juice and the lime zest and pour the syrup over the fruit. Chill the compote, covered, for at least 3 hours or overnight and serve it with ice cream if desired.

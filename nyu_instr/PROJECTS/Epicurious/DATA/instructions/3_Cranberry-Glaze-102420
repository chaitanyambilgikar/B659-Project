Combine cranberries and sugar in processor. Using on/off turns, coarsely chop cranberries. Transfer mixture to heavy medium saucepan. Add 1 cup water and orange peel and bring to boil, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat; simmer until mixture is reduced to 2 1/3 cups, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. Cool to room temperature. Cover; chill overnight or up to 2 days (mixture will thicken).

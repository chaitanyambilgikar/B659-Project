Mix flour and salt together. Rub in margarine with fingertips.
Add sugar, and stir. Add beaten egg and milk to make a smooth batter.
Pour a little oil on a well-greased griddle or frying pan. (Mum's note: Pan needs to be pretty damned hot.) Drop three separate spoonfuls in at a time. Leave until bubbles pop on the surface and then turn over and cook till brown on bottom.
When done, place in a clean dish towel and cover till all have been cooked. (Mum's note: Not sure why we need to do this, but that is the way I was shown.)
Cool, then butter them (liberally) as you serve them.

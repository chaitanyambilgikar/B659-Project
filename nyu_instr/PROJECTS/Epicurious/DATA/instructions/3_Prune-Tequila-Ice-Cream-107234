Pack prunes into a 1/2-pint jar and add tequila (it should just cover them). Cover jar and let prunes macerate at least 12 hours at room temperature.
Bring cream, half-and-half, and vanilla bean to a boil in a 2- to 3-quart heavy saucepan. Whisk together yolks and sugar in a bowl, then add hot cream mixture in a stream, whisking. Pour custard into saucepan and cook over moderately low heat, stirring with a wooden spoon, until it registers 170 to 175°F on an instant-read thermometer. Immediately pour custard through a very fine sieve into a bowl, then cool to room temperature, stirring occasionally. Chill custard, covered, until very cold, about 4 hours.
Pulse prunes with macerating liquid in a food processor until prunes form a thick, slightly chunky purée. Add about 1 cup cold custard and pulse just until combined well, then whisk into remaining custard.
Freeze custard in ice cream maker. Transfer ice cream to an airtight container and put in freezer to harden at least 12 hours. (The tequila gives this ice cream a slightly softer texture than regular ice cream.)

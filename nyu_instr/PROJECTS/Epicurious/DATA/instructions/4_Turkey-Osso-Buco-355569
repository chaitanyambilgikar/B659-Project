1. Preheat oven to 325°F.
2. In an uncovered Dutch oven over medium heat, brown the turkey pieces on both sides in 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, about 20 minutes. Remove them from the pan; set aside.
3. Brown the onion, celery, and carrot in the remaining olive oil until soft, about 5 minutes.
4. Return the turkey pieces to the pan and add the mari-nara, broth or wine, and herbs. Simmer in the oven, covered, until the meat is fork-tender, about 1/1/2 hours.

Preheat oven to 400°F.
Quarter puff pastry sheet with a sharp knife to form 4 squares. Stir together cream cheese and 1 1/2 tablespoons sugar, then divide among squares, spreading to leave a 3/4-inch border of pastry all around. Sprinkle fruit over cream cheese. Brush some egg on pastry border. Fold pastry into a triangle to enclose filling and crimp edges with a fork. Cut a small steam vent in tops of turnovers. Brush tops with more egg and sprinkle with remaining â€š tablespoon sugar.
Arrange on a lightly buttered baking sheet and bake in lower third of oven until puffed and golden brown, about 25 minutes.

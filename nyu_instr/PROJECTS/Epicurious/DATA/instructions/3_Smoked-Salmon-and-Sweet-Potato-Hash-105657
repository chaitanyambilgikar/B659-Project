Spray six 3/4-cup ramekins with nonstick spray. Heat vegetable oil in large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add sweet potatoes, leeks, and red bell pepper and sauté 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low; cover and cook until potatoes are tender, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. Uncover, increase heat to medium-high and cook without stirring until potatoes are brown on bottom, about 5 minutes. Using spatula, break mixture into pieces and turn over. Cook until brown on bottom, about 3 minutes. Stir in salmon, dill, and orange peel. Season mixture with salt and pepper. Divide hash among prepared ramekins; press to compact. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Uncover and reheat in 325°F oven 15 minutes before serving.)
Unmold hash onto 6 plates. Top each serving with 2 teaspoons crème fraîche.

Bake each pound cake in a loaf pan according to package directions. Allow to cool. Using a large serrated knife, trim crust off all sides of cake to make an even rectangle. Slice the rectangle in half lengthwise, then cut each piece in half lengthwise. Cut each long section crosswise three times to make 16 small squares. Repeat with second loaf.
Using a small serrated knife, cut a square from the center of each cube, leaving a 1/2-inch wall around the edges. Remove the cut sections carefully, making sure to leave enough cake on the bottom to hold the filling.
Place the squares on an unlined baking sheet. Brush the upper edges of the cake squares with the melted butter using a pastry brush. Place under broiler for a few minutes until lightly toasted, making sure to watch closely — the squares brown quickly. Remove from oven and let cool.
These can be made up to 2 days ahead. If storing, pound cake squares can be transferred to airtight containers or placed closely together on a baking sheet and covered with plastic wrap, and stored in the refrigerator.
Place the whipping cream in the bowl of an electric mixer and whip until soft peaks form. Add the sugar slowly and whip until slightly stiff. Place a spoonful of whipped cream on each square, topped with sliced and whole berries, and serve.

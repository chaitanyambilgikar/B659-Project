In a saucepan heat milk, butter, and syrup just until warm (about 105°F.) and butter begins to melt and remove pan from heat. Stir in yeast and let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes.
In a bowl of a standing electric mixer (or a large bowl if kneading by hand) whisk together flour and salt. In a small bowl lightly beat together whole egg, yolk, and mustard.
With dough hook stir milk mixture and egg mixture into flour mixture to form a sticky dough. With dough hook knead dough 5 minutes, or until smooth and elastic (dough will be soft). (Alternatively, dough may be formed with a wooden spoon and kneaded on a floured surface with floured hands until smooth and elastic, 10 to 15 minutes.)
Transfer dough to a lightly oiled large bowl and turn to coat with oil. Let dough rise, covered loosely, in a warm place 1 hour, or until doubled in bulk.
Make glaze: In a small bowl with a fork stir together butter, syrup, and egg.
Grease a 13- by 9-inch roasting or baking pan.
Punch down dough and divide into 20 pieces. Form each piece into a smooth ball and transfer to pan. Brush rolls with about half of glaze and let rise, covered loosely with plastic wrap, in a warm place about 1 hour, or until doubled in bulk.
Preheat oven to 400°F. Brush rolls with remaining glaze and sprinkle with seeds. Bake rolls in middle of oven 20 minutes, or until golden brown, and cool in pan on a rack 20 minutes. Rolls may be made 1 day ahead and kept, covered, in a cool dry place. (Alternatively, rolls may be made 2 weeks ahead and frozen in pan, wrapped well. Thaw rolls at room temperature.) Serve rolls warm or at room temperature.

In a bowl cream together the butter and the sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy, add the egg white and the vanilla, and beat the mixture until it is just combined. Sift the flour over the mixture, fold it in, and fold in the coconut. Working in batches drop the batter by rounded teaspoons 4 inches apart into well-buttered baking sheets and pat it into 3-inch rounds with the back of a fork dipped in water. Bake the cookies in batches in the middle of a preheated 425°F. oven for 4 to 5 minutes, or until they are golden around the edges. Working quickly loosen the cookies carefully with a metal spatula, transfer them to a rolling pin, pressing gently to curl them around the pin, and let them cool completely on the pin. (If the cookies become too firm to remove from the baking sheet, return them to the oven for a few seconds to soften.) The tuiles may be made 1 day in advance and kept in an airtight container.

For mostarda: Bring all ingredients except mustard to simmer in heavy large pot over medium heat, stirring until sugar dissolves. Simmer until liquids thicken and grapes are soft but most are still intact, stirring often, about 30 minutes. Mix in mustard. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 week ahead. Cool, cover, and chill.
For gnocchi: Stir warm milk and sugar in small bowl; mix in yeast. Let stand until mixture looks spongy, about 6 minutes.
Combine 3/4 cup flour, salt, and cayenne in large bowl. Add 7 tablespoons lukewarm water, 1 teaspoon olive oil, and yeast mixture; stir until soft slightly sticky dough forms. Coat another large bowl with olive oil. Add dough and turn to coat. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and kitchen towel. Let dough rise in warm draft-free area until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
Knead dough on work surface until smooth, sprinkling lightly with more flour if very sticky. Divide dough in half. Shape each half into 2-inch-wide 1/3-inch-thick rectangle. Cover with plastic wrap.
Set pasta machine to widest setting. Run 1 rectangle through machine 6 times. Cut dough in half crosswise; turn machine to next-narrower setting. Continue to run dough through machine, adjusting to next-narrower setting after each 6 passes, until each strip is about 4 inches wide, 12 inches long, and 1/16 inch thick. Repeat with second dough rectangle. Cut each dough strip crosswise into 1-inch-wide strips.
Pour canola oil into large saucepan to depth of 1 inch. Attach deep-fry thermometer to pan; heat oil over medium heat to 350°F. Fry dough in batches until golden and crisp, about 2 minutes per batch. Transfer to paper-towel-lined baking sheet. Sprinkle hot gnocchi with cheese. DO AHEAD: Can be made 6 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature. Rewarm in 350°F oven about 5 minutes.
For salumi: Arrange salumi on platter. Serve with mostarda and gnocchi.

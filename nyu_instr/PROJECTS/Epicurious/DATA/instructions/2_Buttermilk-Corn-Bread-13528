Into a large bowl sift together the flour, the cornmeal, the baking powder, the baking soda, and the salt, add the buttermilk, the eggs, the butter, and the sage, and stir the batter until it is just combined. Pour the batter into a well-buttered 8-inch-square baking pan and bake the corn bread in the middle of a preheated 425°F. oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a tester comes out clean. Let the corn bread cool in the pan for 5 minutes, invert it onto a rack, and let it cool completely. (If using the corn bread for stuffing, crumble it coarse into a shallow baking pan and toast it in the middle of a preheated 325°F. oven, stirring occasionally, for 30 to 35 minutes, or until it is dried and deep golden.)

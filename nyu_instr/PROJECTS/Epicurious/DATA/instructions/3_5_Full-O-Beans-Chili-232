Heat oil in heavy large saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic and sauté until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add next 7 ingredients and bring to simmer. Cover, reduce heat to low and simmer until flavors are blended and lima beans are tender, about 30 minutes. Season to taste with salt, pepper and cayenne. Add vinegar to taste. (Can be prepared 2 days ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Reheat chili gently before serving.)

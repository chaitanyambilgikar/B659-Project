Thinly slice mozzarella. Pit, peel, and thinly slice avocado. Spread butter on one side of each bread slice and turn slices over. Spread mustard on bread slices and top 2 slices with mozzarella, avocado, and turkey. Season turkey with salt and pepper and top with remaining 2 bread slices, buttered sides up.
Heat a heavy skillet over moderate heat until hot but not smoking and cook sandwiches until bread is crisp and cheese is melted, about 1 1/2 minutes on each side.
Serve sandwiches with cucumber salad.

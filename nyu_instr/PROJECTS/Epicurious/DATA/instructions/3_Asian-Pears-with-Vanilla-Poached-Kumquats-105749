Scrape seeds from vanilla bean into water with lime juice in a small heavy saucepan, then add pod, sugar, and a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, stirring until sugar is dissolved, then simmer 3 minutes. Add kumquats and simmer, covered, until they just begin to soften, 3 to 4 minutes.
Put pears in a heatproof bowl. Pour kumquats and syrup over pears and toss gently, then cool.
Chill fruit, covered, at least 2 hours.

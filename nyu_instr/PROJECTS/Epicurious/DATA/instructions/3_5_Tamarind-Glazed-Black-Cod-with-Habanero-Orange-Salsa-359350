Heat chiles over gas flame or in broiler until softened, turning often with tongs to avoid burning, 1 to 2 minutes. Cool. Remove stems and seeds. Tear chiles into 2-inch pieces; place in small bowl. Add 1/2 cup hot water. Let stand until softened, about 20 minutes. Place chiles with soaking liquid, orange juice, and next 6 ingredients in blender. Puree until smooth. Strain into small saucepan; discard solids in strainer. Simmer uncovered over medium-low heat until slightly thickened and glaze measures 1 1/3 cups, about 10 minutes. Season glaze with salt and pepper. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.
Preheat broiler. Sprinkle fillets with salt and pepper. Broil until brown, about 2 minutes per side. Spoon 1 tablespoon glaze over each fillet; sprinkle with pepper. Broil until just cooked through and glaze is bubbling, about 2 minutes. Top with Habanero-Orange Salsa; serve immediately.

Heat the olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the garlic and onion and sauté until the onion is soft, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes, chiles, chocolate, sesame seeds, peanut butter, sugar, crackers, and chicken broth. Simmer for 5 minutes.
Transfer the mixture to a blender and puree until smooth. Salt to taste. If the mole has any grittiness, return it to the blender and puree again. Serve warm or cover and store in refrigerator for up to a week.

Make raspberry layers: Blend together all raspberry-ice ingredients in a blender until smooth. Force thourough a fine-mesh sieve set over a bowl, discarding solids.
Make chocolate layers: Bring water, corn syrup, and sugar to a boil in a small saucepan, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Whisk in cocoa and a pinch of salt, then whisk in vanilla. Transfer to a metal bowl. Quick-chill by setting bowl in a larger bowl of ice and cold water and stirring occasionally until cold, about 15 minutes.
Make ice pops: Divide half of raspberry purée among molds, then freeze until partially frozen, about 20 minutes. Divide all of chocolate mixture among molds (layers may run into each other a little) and freeze again until partially frozen (not hard), about 30 minutes.
Fill molds with remaining raspberry purée, then place cover on molds and insert sticks at least thourough middle layer, making sure they are straight (important for removing top when unmolding). Freeze until completely firm, at least 3 hours.
Unmold ice pops: Put molds in a container with room-temperature water up to 1/4 inch from top of molds. Let stand 30 seconds, then remove cover and pull out pops. Serve immediately or wrap individually in plastic wrap and freeze until ready to serve.

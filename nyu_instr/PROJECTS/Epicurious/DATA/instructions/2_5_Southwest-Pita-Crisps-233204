Arrange oven racks in upper and lower thirds of oven and preheat to 350°F. Line 2 large shallow baking sheets with foil.
In small bowl, stir together vegetable oil, chili powder, cumin, and cayenne. Lay 1 pita round on cutting board. Brush both sides with oil mixture and sprinkle one side with 1/4 cup Cheddar. Cut into 6 triangles and place, cheese side up, on baking sheet. Repeat with 5 more pitas (3 pitas per sheet).
Bake 6 minutes. Remove pans from oven, turn chips over with tongs, and bake until golden and crisp, about 3 to 4 minutes more. Transfer crisps to a rack and let cool.
Repeat process with remaining pitas. Store airtight at room temperature up to one month.

Heat 3 tablespoons oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1 1/2 cups green onions, ham, and bell pepper. Sauté until vegetables begin to soften, about 3 minutes. Add potatoes, thyme, and Cajun seasoning; stir to combine. Reduce heat to medium. Cover and cook 8 minutes. Uncover and continue cooking until potatoes are tender and crusty, occasionally scraping up browned bits, adding more oil by tablespoonfuls if potatoes are sticking, about 7 minutes longer. Mix in remaining 1/2 cup green onions. Season with salt and pepper.

In a microwave-safe bowl, mix together the TVP granules and the broth, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and microwave for 5 to 6 minutes. Alternatively, bring the broth to a boil, pour over the TVP granules, cover, and let sit for 10 minutes. Let cool.
In a mixing bowl, crumble the tofu and tempeh. Mix in the reconstituted TVP.
Add the mayonnaise, Sriracha sauce, and sesame oil. Mix well.
Slowly knead in the flour until well incorporated and form into 6 patties. Cook as desired.
Bake at 350°F (180°C, or gas mark 4) for 30 minutes, flipping halfway through, or bake first, then finish off by lightly frying in a smidge of oil until golden and crispy, 2 to 3 minutes on each side.

In a small bowl with a fork combine well the butter, the cream cheese, the chives, the zest, the Tabasco, and salt to taste and transfer the mixture to a pastry bag fitted with a medium-sized open-star tip. Arrange the radishes, cut sides up, on a platter, put a parsley leaf on each radish half, and pipe the chive butter onto it.

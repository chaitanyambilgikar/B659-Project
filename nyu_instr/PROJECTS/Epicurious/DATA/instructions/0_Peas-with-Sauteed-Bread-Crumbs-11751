In a small saucepan simmer the onion in the water, covered, for 4 minutes, stir in the peas, and simmer the mixture, covered, for 4 minutes, or until the peas are just tender. In a small heavy skillet heat the butter over moderately high heat until the foam subsides, add the bread crumbs, and sauté them, stirring, for 3 minutes, or until they are golden. Drain the pea mixture, add it to the bread crumbs with salt and pepper to taste, and sauté the mixture, stirring, for 1 minute.

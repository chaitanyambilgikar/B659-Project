In a large bowl, combine all of the ingredients except the allspice and the vinegar. Allow to stand for 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, toast the allspice berries in a small saucepan until they just begin to smoke. Add the vinegar, bring to a simmer, and reduce to 1/4 cup. Strain, and discard the allspice berries.
Combine the reduced vinegar with the fruit mixture in a large heavy saucepan and simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally, for 20 to 30 minutes until the liquid is almost syrupy. Refrigerated, this will keep for up to 3 months.

Preheat oven to 300°F. Place pecans in medium bowl. Melt butter in heavy small saucepan. Add cumin and cayenne and stir until aromatic, about 15 seconds. Pour over pecans. Add sugar and salt and stir to coat. Transfer to baking pan. Bake until nuts are toasted, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature. (Pecans can be prepared 5 days ahead. Store in airtight container.)

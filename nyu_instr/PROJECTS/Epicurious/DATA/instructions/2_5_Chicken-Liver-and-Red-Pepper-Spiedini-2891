Whisk first 5 ingredients in medium bowl to blend; season dressing to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer half of dressing to small bowl and reserve. Add chicken livers and pepper squares to dressing in medium bowl. Toss to coat well. Marinate 1 hour at room temperature. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover liver mixture and reserved dressing separately and refrigerate.)
Preheat oven to 400deg;F. Alternate 4 pepper squares and 3 liver pieces on each skewer. Arrange on large baking sheet. Place bread, cut side up, on same sheet. Brush bread with some reserved dressing. Bake skewers and bread 6 minutes. Turn skewers over and bake skewers and bread until livers are brown and just cooked through, about 8 minutes longer.
Place 1 toast on each plate. Place 1 skewer atop each toast. Brush lightly with remaining reserved dressing. Garnish with fresh rosemary, if desired.

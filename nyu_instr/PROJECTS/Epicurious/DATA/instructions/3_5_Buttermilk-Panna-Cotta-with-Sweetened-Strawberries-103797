Place six 3/4-cup custard cups on small baking sheet. Combine 1/3 cup sugar and 2 tablespoons water in heavy small saucepan. Stir over medium-low heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat and boil without stirring until syrup turns deep amber, occasionally brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush and swirling pan, about 8 minutes. Immediately pour caramel into custard cups, dividing equally; tilt cups to cover bottoms evenly (caramel layer will be thin). Cool until caramel is set.
Pour 1/4 cup whipping cream into small bowl; sprinkle gelatin over. Let stand until gelatin softens, about 10 minutes. Combine remaining 6 tablespoons sugar and remaining 1 3/4 cups cream in heavy medium saucepan. Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add bean. Bring just to simmer. Remove from heat. Add gelatin mixture and whisk until gelatin dissolves. Strain mixture into 4-cup glass measuring cup. Whisk in buttermilk. Divide mixture among caramel-lined custard cups. Refrigerate panna cotta uncovered overnight. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Cover; keep chilled.)
Toss strawberries and brown sugar in large bowl. Let stand until juices form, about 30 minutes and up to 2 hours.
Run small knife between panna cotta and custard cups to loosen. Invert onto plates. Using rubber spatula, scrape any caramel remaining on bottom of cups over panna cotta. Spoon sweetened strawberries alongside and serve.

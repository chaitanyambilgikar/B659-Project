Cook pasta as directed on package; reserve 1/4 cup cooking water. Heat cooking spray in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Sauté onion and pepper until tender, about 7 minutes. Raise heat to medium and add turkey; cook until browned, about 8 minutes. Stir in marinara, reduce heat and stir occasionally, until sauce comes to a low simmer, about 6 minutes. Mix 1/2 cup sauce with reserved water in a bowl; toss pasta and sauce; divide among 4 bowls. Top each with equal amounts of remaining sauce and sprinkle with Parmesan.

Whisk 1 cup warm water, egg, and 2 tablespoons oil in large bowl to blend. Add yeast, then flour, whisking until smooth. Cover and let stand at room temperature until batter has almost doubled in volume, about 2 hours. Stir in coconut, sesame seeds, and nutmeg. Cut bananas on deep diagonal into eighteen 1/2-inch-thick slices. (Reserve any remaining bananas for another use.) Add banana slices to batter; stir gently to coat. (Can be prepared up to 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.)
Pour vegetable oil into heavy medium saucepan to depth of 1 1/2 inches. Attach deep-fry thermometer and heat oil to 350°F. Insert fork into 1 banana slice and transfer to oil. Repeat with 5 banana slices. Fry until crisp and golden on all sides, about 3 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer fritters to paper-towel-lined plate to drain. Repeat with remaining bananas in 2 more batches. Divide fritters among 6 plates. Drizzle with honey and serve warm with ice cream.

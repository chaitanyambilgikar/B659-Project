Make filling: Heat the oil in a sauté pan over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook gently for 15-20 seconds, being careful not to let it color.
Add the stock and immediately put the spinach in on top of it. Cook, stirring quickly, because the spinach will cook down rapidly. Season with salt and pepper. Continue to cook for about 1 minute, then remove from the heat and spread out on a cookie sheet to cool.
When cool, transfer to a mixing bowl and gently combine with the goat cheese.Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary.
* If making in advance, store in a tightly covered container in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours.
Make and assemble chicken: Cover the chicken breasts, 1 at a time, with a sheet of plastic wrap and gently pound to a thickness of 1/2 inch. Season with salt and pepper.
Lay each breast in the center of a clean 12 x 18- or 20-inch piece of plastic wrap.
Place one-fourth of the cooled prepared filling in the center of each breast.
Wrap the plastic tightly around the breast and roll up the ends, turning tighter and tighter until the breast is in a cylindrical shape; take care to keep the plastic wrap tight around the roll.
Once the cylinder is formed, continue to twist the ends tightly until they are well sealed. Set aside and repeat with the other 3 breasts.
* If making in advance, the stuffed chicken breasts can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours or frozen for up to several days. When ready to proceed, allow to come to room temperature.
To cook the chicken breasts, set a large pot of water over medium-high heat and bring to a simmer. Carefully place the wrapped chicken breasts in the water and poach for 15-16 minutes.
Remove the chicken breasts with tongs and allow to rest for 5 minutes.
Carefully remove the plastic, using a sharp knife for scissors. Cut the chicken on a bias into 1/2-inch-thick slices and serve.

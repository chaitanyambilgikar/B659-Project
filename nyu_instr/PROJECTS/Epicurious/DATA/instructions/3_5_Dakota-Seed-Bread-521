Cook rice in medium pot of boiling salted water until very tender, about 40 minutes. Drain. Cool completely.
Stir warm water and honey in large bowl. Sprinkle yeast over, let stand until foamy, about 8 minutes. Add rice, whole wheat flour, dry milk, 1/2 cup sunflower seeds, wheat germ, oil and salt and stir until well blended. Gradually mix in enough bread flour to form dough. Cover dough and let rest 15 minutes.
Turn out dough onto floured surface. Knead until smooth and elastic, adding more bread flour if sticky, about 10 minutes. Oil large bowl. Add dough, turning to coat. Cover bowl with clean kitchen towel. Let dough rise in warm area until doubled, about 1 hour.
Line large baking sheet with parchment. Punch down dough. Turn out onto lightly oiled surface. Knead briefly. Divide dough into 2 pieces. Roll each piece between work surface and palms into 12x3-inch loaf. Transfer loaves to oiled baking sheet, spacing evenly. Cover with kitchen towel. Let rise in warm area until almost doubled, about 45 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375°F. Brush loaves generously with egg mixture. Sprinkle with 1/4 cup sunflower seeds. Using sharp knife, cut 3 slashes crosswise in surface of each loaf. Bake until golden and tester inserted into center comes out clean, 35 minutes. Transfer loaves to racks; cool.(Can be made 1 day ahead. Wrap in plastic and store at room temperature.)

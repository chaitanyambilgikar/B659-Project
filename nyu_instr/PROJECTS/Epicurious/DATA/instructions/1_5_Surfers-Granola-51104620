Heat oven to 300°F. Mix oats, millet and flaxseeds (if using), 1/4 teaspoon salt, cinnamon, and ginger in a medium bowl. Add 1 cup hot tap water. Mix thoroughly and let stand for 15 minutes to soften oats.

Increase oven temperature to 350°F. Mix remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, remaining 2 tablespoons oil, almonds, pumpkin and sunflower seeds, and sugar in a medium bowl. Spread in an even layer on another rimmed baking sheet. Bake, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, 10-12 minutes. Place sheet on a wire rack and let nut mixture cool completely.

Cut butter into bits.
In a bowl with a pastry blender or in a food processor blend or pulse together flour, sugar, salt, and butter until mixture resembles coarse meal. In a small bowl whisk together yolks and ice water. Add yolk mixture to flour mixture and toss or pulse until incorporated. Form dough into a ball and wrap in plastic wrap. Chill dough 1 hour.

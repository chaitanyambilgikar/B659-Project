Arrange chicken in single layer in large skillet. Add enough water to cover chicken; bring to boil. Reduce heat, cover and simmer gently until chicken is cooked through, about 12 minutes. Drain chicken; cool slightly. Remove skin and bones; coarsely shred meat. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add onions and sauté until tender, about 10 minutes. Add garlic and jalapeño chili; sauté 1 minute. Mix in chili powder, cumin, oregano and coriander. Add tomatoes, beer and broth. Bring to simmer. Simmer over medium-low heat 1 hour to blend flavors, stirring occasionally.
Add beans to chili. Simmer uncovered until chili thickens, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes. Add shredded chicken. Simmer until chicken is heated through.
Ladle chili into bowls. Serve with salsa, chips, green onions, sour cream and cheese.

In a small heavy dry skillet toast cumin seeds over moderate heat, swirling skillet, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. In a serving bowl whisk together cumin seeds, vinegar, orange juice, zest, and salt and pepper to taste and add oil, whisking until emulsified. Add romaine and toss to coat with dressing.

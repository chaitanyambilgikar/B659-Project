Separate slices into rings, reserving small inner rings for another use if desired.
Stir together flour, baking powder, and 1 teaspoon salt in a bowl. Whisk together egg and milk in another bowl. Spread bread crumbs out on a plate.
Coating rings in batches of 4, dredge rings in flour mixture, shaking off excess, then dip in egg mixture, letting excess drip off, and dredge in crumbs, shaking off excess. Transfer to sheets of wax paper.
Heat 1 inch oil in a 5-quart pot over medium-high heat until it registers 360°F on thermometer. Fry rings in batches of 4 to 6, without crowding, turning over once or twice, until golden brown, about 3 minutes per batch. Transfer to paper towels to drain.

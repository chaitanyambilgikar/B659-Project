Trim endives and quarter lengthwise. Cut out and discard cores, then cut endives diagonally into 1/2-inch-wide strips. Toss with sugar, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1 tablespoon lemon juice in a bowl.
Melt butter in a 10-inch nonstick skillet over moderately low heat and add endive mixture, tossing to coat. Cook, covered, stirring occasionally, until endive is tender, 10 to 12 minutes.
While endive is cooking, toss shrimp with remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/2 tablespoon lemon juice in a bowl.
When endive is tender, increase heat to moderate and cook, uncovered, stirring, until juices are evaporated, about 2 minutes. Stir in cream and simmer 1 minute.
Scatter shrimp over endive and cook, covered, over low heat, without stirring, until shrimp are just cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes.

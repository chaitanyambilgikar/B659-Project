Mash 2 cloves of garlic and blend with 1/4 pound butter. Let this stand for 1/2 hour. Meanwhile, chop 2 more cloves of garlic very fine and sprinkle them inside the cavity of a chicken. Add the parsley and the cube of butter and close the vent with foil. Truss the chicken well.
Melt the garlic butter, add the lemon juice and salt and pepper. Roast the chicken on a spit, basting it frequently with the melted butter mixture.
Serve this highly flavored fowl with noodles dressed with butter and cheese, celery sticks and toasted herbed bread. Split a loaf of French bread and spread it with butter to which you have added parsley, chives and rosemary. Toast until heated through and crisp. Choose a robust Chianti to drink with this garlicky chicken.

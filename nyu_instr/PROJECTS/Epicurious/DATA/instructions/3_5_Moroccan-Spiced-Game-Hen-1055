Preheat oven to 450°F. Combine garlic and salt in small bowl. Using fork, mash into paste. Mix in ginger, cumin, coriander and cayenne. Loosen skin of each game hen quarter, creating pocket but leaving skin attached. Rub seasoning mixture onto meat under loosened skin, dividing equally. Arrange quarters in shallow roasting pan. Season lightly with salt and pepper.
Bake until cooked through and juices run clear when thigh meat is pierced, about 25 minutes. Transfer hen quarters to platter and serve.

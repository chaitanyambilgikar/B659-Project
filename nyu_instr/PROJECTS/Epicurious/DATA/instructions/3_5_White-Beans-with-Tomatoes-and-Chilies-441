Heat olive oil in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat. Add jalapeño chilies, sage and chopped garlic and sauté until garlic is tender but not brown, about 5 minutes. Add cannellini beans and tomatoes and simmer until mixture thickens and flavors blend, about 15 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve.

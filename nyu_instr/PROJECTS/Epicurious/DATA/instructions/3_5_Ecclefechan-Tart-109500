For crust: Blend flour, sugar, and salt in processor 5 seconds. Add butter. Using on/off turns, process until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add cream. Using on/off turns, process until dough comes together in moist clumps. Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk. Wrap and chill at least 1 hour and up to 1 day.
Roll out dough on lightly floured surface to 12-inch round. Transfer dough to 9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom. Cut overhang to 1/2 inch and fold in, forming double-thick sides. Refrigerate crust 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375°F. Line crust with foil; fill with dried beans or pie weights. Bake until sides are set and slightly brown, about 30 minutes. Remove foil and beans. Continue to bake until pale golden brown, pressing with back of fork and piercing if crust bubbles, about 10 minutes. Cool crust in pan on rack 30 minutes.
For filling: Blend butter and sugar in bowl. Whisk in eggs 1 at a time, then lemon juice, lemon peel, and cinnamon. Stir in raisins and 1 cup chopped nuts.
Pour filling into crust. Bake tart until filling is deep brown and set in center, covering crust edges with foil if browning too quickly, about 30 minutes. Cool tart. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and let stand at room temperature.)
Beat cream in medium bowl until peaks form. Push up pan bottom, releasing tart. Cut tart into wedges; arrange on plates. Spoon cream alongside and garnish with toasted nuts.

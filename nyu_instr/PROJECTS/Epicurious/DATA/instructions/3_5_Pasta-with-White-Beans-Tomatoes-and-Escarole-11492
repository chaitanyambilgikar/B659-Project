In a kettle combine the beans with enough cold water to cover them by 2-inches and simmer them, covered, for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, or until they are tender. Drain the beans in a colander set over a bowl and reserve the cooking liquid. In a large deep skillet cook the onion, the garlic, the sage, the rosemary, the thyme, the red pepper flakes, and salt and pepper to taste in the oil over moderately low heat, stirring, until the onion is softened, add the escarole in 2 batches, and cook each batch, stirring, for 2 minutes, or until the escarole is wilted. Add the wine and simmer the mixture for 3 minutes. In a blender or food processor purée 1 1/2 cups of the cooked beans with 2 cups of the reserved cooking liquid and add to the skillet with the remaining beans, the tomatoes with the reserved juice, and salt and pepper to taste. Simmer the sauce, uncovered, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes, or until it is thickened slightly, and stir in the parsley. In a kettle of boiling salted water cook the fusilli until it is al dente, drain it well, and in a large bowl toss it with the sauce and the Parmesan.

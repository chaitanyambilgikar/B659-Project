Combine the tuna, 2 tablespoons mayonnaise, and wasabi paste in a small bowl and mix until blended.
Lay the tortillas on a work surface. Spread 1/2 tablespoon mayonnaise on each tortilla and arrange the lettuce on top of both; arrange cucumber, carrot, and avocado lengthwise in rows near one edge. Spoon the tuna in a line next to the vegetables (away from the edge). Roll each tortilla up snugly into a cylinder. Cut crosswise in half.

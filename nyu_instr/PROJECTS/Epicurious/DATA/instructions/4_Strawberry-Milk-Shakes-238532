For milk shakes: Place four 12-ounce glasses in freezer for 1 hour.
Place 1 cup Strawberry Syrup, 1 cup milk, and 1 pint ice cream in blender; purée until smooth. Add second pint of ice cream and purée until almost smooth. Divide mixture among frozen glasses. Drizzle each with some Strawberry Syrup, garnish with strawberry, if desired, and serve with spoon and straw.

In a bowl combine well the flour and the thyme and in the mixture dredge the chicken, shaking off the excess. In a skillet heat the oil over moderate heat until it is hot but not smoking and in it cook the chicken, patted dry, for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, or until it is browned lightly. Add the brandy, deglaze the skillet, scraping up any brown bits, and boil the mixture for 2 minutes. Stir in the mushrooms, the pecans, the apples, and the shallot and cook the mixture for 2 minutes. Add the apple juice and the cream and cook the mixture for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the sauce is thickened slightly and the chicken is just cooked through. Transfer the chicken with a slotted spoon to 2 heated plates and spoon the sauce over it.

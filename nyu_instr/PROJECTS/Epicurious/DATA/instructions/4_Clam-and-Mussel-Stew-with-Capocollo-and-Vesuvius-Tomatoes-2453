To prepare the clams: Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium heat. Add leeks and garlic and sauté until tender, about 10 minutes. Add Vesuvius Tomatoes and wine and boil 2 minutes. Add clams and clam juice. Cover and cook 5 minutes. Add mussels, cover and cook until clams and mussels open, about 4 minutes longer (discard any shellfish that do not open). Mix in capocollo and parsley. Serve hot.
To prepare the tomatoes: Preheat oven to 250°F. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add onions and sauté until tender, about 8 minutes. Place tomatoes in single layer in large roasting pan. Add onions, 1/2 cup oil, garlic, basil, salt, sugar and red pepper; toss to coat. Roast until tomatoes are tender but not falling apart, stirring occasionally, about 2 hours.

Using vegetable peeler, remove peel (yellow part only) from lemons in long strips. Squeeze 6 tablespoons juice from lemons. Blanch peel in small saucepan of boiling water 10 seconds; drain. Repeat twice. Place reserved 6 tablespoons lemon juice, sugar, and peppercorns in small saucepan. Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add bean. Bring to boil, stirring to dissolve sugar. Add peel, reduce heat to low, and simmer gently until tender and partly translucent, about 12 minutes. Cool lemon peel in syrup. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 month ahead. Keep chilled and completely covered in syrup. Always use clean fork to remove lemon.

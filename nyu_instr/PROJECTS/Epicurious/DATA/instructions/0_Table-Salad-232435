Arrange the greens in an attractive manner on one side of a large platter. Place the cucumber, bean sprouts and herbs on the other side. Place the platter in the center of the table and serve.
NOTE: If a table salad accompanies a grilled meat dish, you can also serve presoaked rice papers on the side. Just layer some lettuce in between the rice sheets so they don't stick. Or let the guests wet the rice sheets themselves by soaking them in a bowl of warm water at the table.

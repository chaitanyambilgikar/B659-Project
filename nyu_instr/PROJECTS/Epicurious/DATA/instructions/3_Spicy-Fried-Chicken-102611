Put the chicken pieces in a large bowl and cover with milk. Refrigerate for 1 hour or longer. Drain the chicken and shake off the excess liquid. Mix the garlic powder, seasoning salt, black pepper, and cayenne; sprinkle the spices over the chicken so that the pieces are evenly coated.
Pour the flour into a large plastic bag and add the chicken pieces, a few at a time, shaking gently. As the pieces are floured, transfer them to a wire rack or a sheet of waxed paper, placing them well apart from one another. Let stand for 20 to 25 minutes.
Heat the oil in a large, heavy skillet over high heat until it is nearly smoking. Add the chicken pieces in one layer; the fat should come halfway up the pieces. Cover and cook 10 to 12 minutes, or until golden brown on one side; turn the pieces and reduce the heat to medium-low. Continue cooking, covered, until evenly browned on both sides, turning as needed. Total cooking time should be 20 to 25 minutes. As the pieces are cooked through, remove them to a rack to drain.

On a plate stir together flour and salt and pepper to taste. Dredge chicken in flour, shaking off excess.
In a large heavy skillet heat oil and butter over moderately high heat until foam subsides and brown chicken, turning it once, until golden. Add wine and broth and simmer chicken, turning it once, until just cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer chicken to a plate to cool completely.
While chicken is cooling, in a bowl whisk together mayonnaise, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, water, and salt and pepper to taste. Cut chicken into very thin slices.
Discard coarse stems from arugula and mound arugula on each of 6 plates. Arrange chicken slices over arugula and drizzle with sauce.

In a saucepan combine the lentils, the water, and the bay leaf, bring the water to a boil, and simmer the mixture, covered, for 15 minutes. Add salt to taste and simmer the mixture, covered, for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the lentils are just tender.
While the lentils are simmering, in a heavy skillet cook the onion, the carrot, the celery, the garlic, and the thyme with salt and pepper to taste in the oil over moderately low heat, stirring, until the vegetables are softened. Drain the lentils in a sieve, discarding the bay leaf. Add the lentils, the vinegar, and the parsley to the skillet, heat the mixture over low heat, stirring, until it is heated through, and keep the lentil mixture warm, covered. In another heavy skillet brown the kielbasa over moderate heat and transfer it to paper towels to drain. Divide the lentil mixture between 2 plates, mounding it, and top it with the kielbasa.

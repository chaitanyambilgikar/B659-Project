Allow the lamb to come to room temperature, approximately 1 hour if straight from the refrigerator.
Prepare a "mature level" coal bed, with a clean thin grate or rack set over it if you like; the fire should be very hot.
Season the lamb chops on both sides with the seasoning blend, then lightly moisten your hands with water and work the seasonings into the meat. Allow to stand for 5 minutes to develop a "meat paste."*
Fan or blow-dry excess ash from the coal fire.
Using an herb brush, brush the chops lightly all over with the butter baste. Put the lamb chops on the grill grate or directly on the coals and cook, without moving them, for 3 minutes. Turn, baste lightly, and cook for 3 minutes, then repeat, basting each time the chops are flipped.
Put the foil-wrapped brick on the grill grate or on the coals to be used as a steady point for the chops, lean the chops up against it, fat side down, and cook for 1 minute, or until the internal temperature registers 120°F on an instant-read thermometer.
Meanwhile, pour the dressing board onto a cutting board (or mix it directly on the board). Finely chop the tip of the herb brush and mix the herbs into the dressing.
Transfer the lamb chops to the cutting board and turn in the dressing to coat, then transfer to plates and serve.

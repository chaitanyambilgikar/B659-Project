Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 400°F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
Whisk together flour, baking powder, granulated sugar, and salt in a bowl. Blend in butter cubes with your fingertips or a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse meal. Stir together egg and buttermilk in another bowl, then add to flour mixture, stirring with a fork until a dough forms.
Gather dough into a ball, then turn out onto a floured surface and gently knead 7 or 8 times. Roll out dough with a floured rolling pin into a 1/2-inch-thick round and cut out as many biscuits as possible with biscuit cutter. Gather scraps and knead once, then pat out into a 1/2-inch-thick round and cut out more biscuits.
Arrange biscuits 1 inch apart on baking sheet and brush tops and sides with melted butter. Stir together turbinado sugar and cinnamon and sprinkle over biscuits (sugar will form a crust).
Bake until golden brown and cooked through, about 15 minutes. Transfer biscuits to a rack and cool to warm, about 10 minutes.

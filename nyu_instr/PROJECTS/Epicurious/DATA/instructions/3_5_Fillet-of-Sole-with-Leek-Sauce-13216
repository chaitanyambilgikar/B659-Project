In a microwave-safe glass casserole microwave the butter at high power (100%) for 1 minute, or until it is melted. Stir in the leeks and salt to taste and microwave the mixture, covered with the lid, at high power (100%) for 10 minutes, or until the leek is tender. Transfer the leek mixture to a saucepan and add the wine. Season the sole with salt and pepper and fold the fillets, skinned sides in, into thirds. Arrange the fillets in the casserole and microwave them, covered with lid, at high power (100%) for 3 minutes, or until they just flake. While the fish is cooking, boil the leek mixture until almost all the liquid is evaporated. Transfer the fish with a slotted spatula to heated plates and keep it warm, covered with foil. Add the fish liquid remaining in the casserole to the leek mixture and boil the mixture until the liquid is reduced by half. Add the cream and boil the mixture, stirring, until the sauce is thickened slightly. Season the sauce with the lemon juice and salt and pepper, spoon it around the fish, and garnish each serving with the parsley.

In a blender purée the garlic and the gingerroot with the soy sauce, the vinegar, the honey, the aniseed, and the salt. In a resealable plastic bag combine the marinade with the chicken thighs and let the chicken marinate at room temperature for 15 minutes. Arrange the chicken on the rack of a foil-lined broiler pan, discarding the marinade, and roast it in the middle of a preheated 425°F. oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until it is cooked through.

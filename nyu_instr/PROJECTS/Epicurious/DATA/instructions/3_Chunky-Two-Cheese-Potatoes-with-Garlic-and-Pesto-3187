Preheat oven to 375°F. Place potatoes in 18x12-inch rimmed baking sheet. Mix cream, sun-dried tomatoes, shallots, garlic, pesto and white pepper in large bowl to blend. Pour over potatoes; stir gently to coat. Sprinkle both cheeses over potato mixture. Bake until potatoes are tender and cheese is golden brown on top, about 45 minutes. Let cool 10 minutes before serving.

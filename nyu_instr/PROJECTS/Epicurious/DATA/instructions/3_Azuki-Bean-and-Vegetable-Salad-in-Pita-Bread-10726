In a small saucepan combine beans with water to cover by 2 inches and simmer until tender, about 45 minutes for azuki beans or about 15 minutes for lentils. In a sieve drain beans and rinse. Drain beans well and transfer to a bowl.
In a large saucepan of boiling salted water blanch carrots 1 minute and add broccoli stems. Blanch carrot mixture 2 minutes and drain in sieve. Rinse vegetables under cold water until cool and drain well. Add blanched vegetables to beans with celery, bell pepper, parsley, garlic, and provolone.
In a small bowl whisk together vinegar and salt and pepper to taste. Add oil in a stream, whisking, and whisk until emulsified. Pour dressing over bean mixture and toss well. Salad may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.
Serve salad in pita halves.

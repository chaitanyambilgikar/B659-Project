Preheat oven to 350°F. Set rings on a baking sheet and lightly spray insides with cooking spray.
In a large bowl with an electric mixer beat whites until frothy. Add cream of tartar and beat until whites just hold soft peaks. Beat in superfine sugar, a little at a time, and beat until whites just hold stiff peaks. Sift flour with salt over whites and gently fold in with remaining ingredients.
Spoon batter into rings, mounding batter, and bake in middle of oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes (cakes will fall slightly during baking). Transfer rings on sheet to a rack to cool. Run a thin knife around edges of rings and gently remove cakes, transferring them to plates.
Dust cakes with confectioners' sugar and spoon syrup around them.

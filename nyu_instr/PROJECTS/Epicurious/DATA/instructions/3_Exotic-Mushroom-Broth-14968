Chop shallots and slice garlic. In a 6-quart kettle bring broth and water to a boil with shallots, garlic, dried mushrooms, and thyme and cook at a bare simmer 1 hour. Line a large sieve with a double thickness of cheesecloth or dampened paper towels and pour liquid through sieve into a large bowl. Press hard on solids and discard. Broth may be made 3 days ahead and chilled, covered.
Discard shiitake stems and thinly slice caps. In cleaned kettle simmer broth, shiitake caps, parsley, and Sherry, stirring occasionally, 10 minutes, or until mushrooms are tender, and season with salt and pepper.

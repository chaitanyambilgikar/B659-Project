Make chips: Peel beets with a vegetable peeler, then slice paper-thin with slicer, using stems as handles.
Bring water and sugar to a boil in a 3-quart heavy saucepan, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Add beets, then remove pan from heat and let stand15 minutes. Drain beets in a colander, discarding liquid, then let stand in colander 15 minutes more.
Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 225°F.
Line a shallow baking pan with nonstick liner, then arrange beet slices snugly in 1 layer (it's not necessary to use any partial or broken slices) and season with salt and pepper. Bake beets until dry, about 1 hour. Immediately transfer chips to a rack to cool (chips will crisp as they cool).
Make curried cream while beets bake: Cook shallot in oil in a small skillet over moderate heat, stirring frequently, until golden, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in curry powder and cook, stirring, 1 minute.
Stir shallot into sour cream in a bowl along with chives, salt, and pepper. Serve curried cream with beet chips.

Mix first 4 ingredients in small bowl. Pour sauce into ramekin.
Submerge 1 rice paper round in large bowl filled with room-temperature water. Let stand until soft and pliable but not limp, lifting occasionally to determine if soft, about 1 minute. Place softened round on work surface. Mound 2/3 cup coleslaw mix at end of round closest to you; sprinkle with 1 tablespoon cilantro and 2 teaspoons mint. Top with 4 shrimp halves, cut side down, in single layer. Fold in ends of round; roll up tightly into cylinder. Repeat with remaining ingredients to form 3 more rolls. Cut rolls diagonally in half; arrange on plate and serve with sauce.

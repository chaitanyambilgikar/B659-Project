Peel and finely chop the onion, carrot, and garlic. Finely chop the celery. Sauté the vegetables in the olive oil in a medium saucepan over low heat, stirring, until they begin to soften, about 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, if using fresh tomatoes, peel and seed them, then roughly chop.
Stir the fresh or canned tomatoes into the vegetables. For extra zing, add some red pepper flakes. Simmer gently for 2 hours, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is thick and flavorful. Season with salt and pepper.

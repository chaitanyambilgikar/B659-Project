Heat oil in heavy medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onions and garlic and sauté until beginning to soften, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes with juices, jalapeños and chipotles. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer 15 minutes to blend flavors, stirring occasionally.
Puree 1 cup salsa in blender. Return to same saucepan. Stir in cilantro. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Rewarm over medium heat.)

Transfer the oven rack to the lowest level. Preheat oven to 325°F. Sift 1 cup sugar with flour, cocoa, and salt; set aside. Using an electric mixer set at medium-high speed, whip egg whites, lemon juice, and vanilla in a medium-sized bowl until peaks form. Set mixer to high speed and whip in remaining 1/2 cup sugar until semistiff peaks form (do not overbeat). With a plastic spatula, slowly fold in the remaining dry ingredients, 1/4 cup at a time, until flour mix disappears. Scoop batter into a 10" ungreased tube pan and spread evenly. Bake until cake springs back when touched, 45 to 55 minutes. Remove from oven, invert cake pan, and place upside down on a cooling rack. Thoroughly wash and dry berries. Combine berries, nectar, and honey in a small bowl. Mix slowly, being careful not to crush the berries. In a separate bowl, combine yogurt and syrup until blended. Remove cake gently from pan and cut into 8 slices. Serve each slice with fruit and a dollop of maple yogurt.

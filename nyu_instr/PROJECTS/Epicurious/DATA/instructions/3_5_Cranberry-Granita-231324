Combine 4 cups cranberries and next 4 ingredients in heavy large saucepan. Bring to boil, stirring until sugar dissolves. Remove from heat, cover, and let steep 30 minutes. Working in batches, puree mixture in processor. Strain puree into large bowl, pressing to extract as much liquid as possible.
Pour strained puree into 15x10x2-inch dish. Freeze 45 minutes. Using fork, stir to blend in any frozen portions. Freeze until granita has uniform slushy consistency, stirring every 45 minutes to incorporate frozen portions, about 5 hours. Cover and keep frozen up to 1 day.
Using fork tines, scrape granita, forming icy flakes. Spoon into goblets. Garnish with cranberries and mint sprigs.

Make coeurs: Beat together cream cheese, sour cream, confectioners sugar, vanilla, juice, and a pinch of salt with an electric mixer until smooth. Force mixture through a fine sieve into a bowl to remove any fine lumps.
Line molds with a single layer of dampened cheesecloth and divide cheese mixture among molds, smoothing tops. Fold overhanging cheesecloth over tops, pressing it lightly. Refrigerate molds in a shallow pan or dish (to catch drips) at least 4 hours.
Make topping: Mash half of blackberries with granulated sugar. Stir in remaining whole berries, cassis, and juice, then macerate, stirring occasionally, 20 minutes.
Unmold coeurs and carefully peel off cheesecloth. Let coeurs stand at room temperature 20 minutes before serving. Spoon topping over coeurs.

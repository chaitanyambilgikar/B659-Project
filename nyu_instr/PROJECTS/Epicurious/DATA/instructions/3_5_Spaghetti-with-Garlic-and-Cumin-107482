Mix first 5 ingredients in small bowl; set aside. Cook spaghetti in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally. Drain spaghetti, reserving 3/4 cup cooking liquid. Return pasta to pot. Add oil mixture and toss over medium heat to coat, about 1 minute, adding reserved cooking liquid by 1/4 cupfuls if dry. Season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and serve.

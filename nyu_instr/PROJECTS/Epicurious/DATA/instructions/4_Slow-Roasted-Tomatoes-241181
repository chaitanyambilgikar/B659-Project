Preheat oven to 350°F with rack in middle. Lightly butter an 8-inch shallow baking dish.
Stir together sugar, salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a cup.
Put tomatoes in baking dish and sprinkle all over with sugar mixture. Dot tomatoes with butter, then bake until tomatoes are partially collapsed and deeply caramelized in places, 1 to 2 hours. Serve warm or at room temperature.

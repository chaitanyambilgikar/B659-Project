Uncover vegetables; add tomatoes and garlic and sauté until tomatoes soften and almost all liquid evaporates, about 8 minutes. Increase heat to medium. Add wine and boil 1 minute. Strain shrimp stock into vegetable mixture. Boil until mixture is reduced to 8 generous cups, about 1 hour 15 minutes.
Puree half of soup in blender in batches. Combine with remaining soup. Season soup with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Bring to simmer before continuing.)

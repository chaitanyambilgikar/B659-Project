Method To prepare the vinaigrette: Place the shallots and 3/4 cup of the olive oil in a small ovenproof pan and cover tightly. Bake at 350 degrees for 50 to 60 minutes, or until the shallots are soft. Let the shallots cool in the olive oil, and then remove, reserving the oil. Julienne the shallots and put them in a bowl. Add the balsamic vinegar and slowly whisk in the reserved olive oil. Add the chopped chives and season to taste with salt and pepper.
To prepare the polenta: Cook the garlic in 3 tablespoons of butter for 1 minute. Fold into the polenta and season to taste with salt and pepper. Spread the polenta into a 1/2-inch thick layer on a small sheet pan. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2 hours. Cut the polenta into four 3-inch discs and sauté in the remaining 1 tablespoon butter in a hot, nonstick pan for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and crispy. Blot on paper towels.
To prepare the steak: Season the steak with salt and pepper and rub with 1/4 cup olive oil. Remove the thyme leaves from the stems and rub them onto the beef. Grill for 5 to 7 minutes on each side, or until medium-rare.
Assembly Place a piece of the polenta in the center of each plate and top with a piece of the steak. Spoon the Roasted Shallot Vinaigrette over the steak and around the plates and top with freshly ground black pepper.
Wine Notes The warm garlic flavors in the polenta mesh beautifully with Italian varietals. The rich fruit of Barbera d'Alba from a producer like Giacomo Conterno beautifully balances the garlic, and has the full acidity needed for the shallot vinaigrette.

Marinate shrimp: Butterfly shrimp by cutting almost, but not all the way, through backs. Toss with garlic, oil, and lime juice. Season with salt. Marinate, chilled, 1 hour.
Make chutney: Drain yogurt in a fine-mesh sieve set over a bowl, chilled, 1 hour. Cook coriander and cumin in oil in a small skillet over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until fragrant. Coarsely chop chiles, then purée in a blender with drained yogurt, coriander mixture, and cilantro until smooth. Stir in lime juice, pistachios, and salt to taste.
Make satés: Preheat broiler.
Gently press 1 shrimp open and thread lengthwise onto a skewer near pointed end. Repeat with remaining shrimp and skewers.
Arrange satÃ©s in a row on 1 long side of a broiler pan so that blunt ends of skewers point toward middle of pan. Cover exposed portions of skewers with a sheet of foil (donâ€™t cover shrimp). Arrange another row of satÃ©s over foil. Continue adding rows of satÃ©s and layers of foil until pan is full, making sure exposed skewer ends of last row of satÃ©s are covered with foil.
Broil until shrimp are just cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes.
Serve satés with chutney for dipping.

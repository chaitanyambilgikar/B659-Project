Boil apricot syrup in heavy small saucepan until reduced to 2/3 cup, about 15 minutes. Mix in 3 tablespoons raisins, 2 tablespoons rum and 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 1 minute. Transfer to medium bowl and mix in 3 tablespoons honey. Refrigerate sauce until cold, at least 1 hour. Mix in apricots. (Rum-raisin sauce can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and keep refrigerated.) Scoop ice cream into bowls; top with apricots and sauce.

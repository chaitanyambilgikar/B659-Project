Preheat oven to 400°F and grease 36 1 3/4- by 1-inch muffin cups (see note, above).
In a large bowl whisk together eggs, oil, matzo meal, salt, and baking powder. Grate onion on large holes of a 4-sided grater and whisk into egg mixture. Working quickly, in 2 batches, peel and quarter potatoes and in a food processor finely chop. Add potatoes as chopped to egg mixture and stir until coated well.
Working quickly, spoon a rounded tablespoon potato mixture into each muffin cup and bake in upper and lower thirds of oven, switching position of pans halfway through baking, until golden brown, about 30 minutes.
Cool potato bites in pans on racks 2 minutes. Run a thin knife around edge of each cup and transfer potato bites to a serving plate. Potato bites may be chilled, covered, 2 days or frozen 1 month. Reheat potato bites on a baking sheet in a 400°F oven until crisp, 10 to 15 minutes.

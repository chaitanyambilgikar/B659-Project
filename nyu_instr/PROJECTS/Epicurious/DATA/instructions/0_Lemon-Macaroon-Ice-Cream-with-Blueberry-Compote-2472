Using vegetable peeler, cut peel (yellow part only) in wide strips from 3 lemons. Finely grate enough peel from remaining lemon to measure 1 1/4 teaspoons packed peel. Squeeze enough juice from lemon to yield 5 teaspoons. Combine milk and lemon peel strips in medium saucepan and bring to simmer. Remove from heat; cover pan and let steep 20 minutes.

Trim fennel stalks flush with bulb, discarding stalks, and cut enough of bulb into 1/4-inch dice to measure 1/3 cup. Peel and seed tomato. Separately cut enough tomato and zucchini into 1/4-inch dice to measure 1/2 cup each. In a small saucepan of boiling water blanch zucchini 1 minute and drain in a sieve. Rinse zucchini under cold water to stop cooking and drain well.

Add garlic and olives to vegetable mixture with parsley, basil, capers, and oils, stirring to combine well. Chill salad, covered, at least 2 hours and up to 6.

Repeat procedure with liquid remaining in skillet and remaining mussels.

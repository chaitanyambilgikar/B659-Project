Coat each fish with 1/2 tablespoon of the oil and freshly ground black pepper. Set aside while you prepare the peperonata.
Cut the peppers into long, thin strips, no more than 1/4" wide, making sure to remove all of the seeds.
In a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Add the pepper strips, 1/2 teaspoon whole black peppercorns, and 1/2 teaspoon coarse salt. Reduce the heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally, until the peppers are soft and lightly browned, about 20 minutes. Remove the peppers from the heat and set aside.
Heat an iron-ribbed grill pan or nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Add the fish and cook on both sides, about 3 minutes per side, until the fish is browned on the outside and moist inside. Meanwhile, briefly warm the peppers. Serve the fish with the warm peperonata on top.
nutritionist's note:The olive oil in this dish gives the peppers a nutritional boost. Fat allows your body to better absorb the beta-carotene found in bell peppers.

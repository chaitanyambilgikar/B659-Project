Toss cucumber with salt in a colander and let drain 15 minutes.
Whisk together sour cream, vinegar, sugar, and pepper in a medium bowl until just combined.
Rinse cucumber under running water, then wrap in a kitchen towel and squeeze out excess moisture. Add cucumber and onion to sour cream mixture and toss to coat.

1 In a large saucepan, combine 3 1/2 cups of the milk with the rice, cardamom (if using), salt, vanilla, and sugar. Bring to a boil.
2 Reduce heat to medium and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until the rice is cooked and the milk has begun to thicken, about 40 minutes.
3 In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, cornstarch, and the remaining milk.
4 Slowly stir the mixture into the rice. Reduce heat to low and continue cooking, stirring constantly, until the texture turns creamy, about 1 minute.
5 Remove the pudding from heat and pour it into 4 serving dishes. Chill them in the fridge, covered, for at least 2 hours before serving.

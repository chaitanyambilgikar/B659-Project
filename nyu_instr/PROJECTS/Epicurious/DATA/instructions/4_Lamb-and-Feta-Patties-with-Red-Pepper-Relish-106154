Make relish: Bring vinegar and sugar to a boil in a 2-quart nonreactive heavy saucepan, stirring until sugar is dissolved, then boil, uncovered, 1 minute. Add remaining relish ingredients and simmer briskly, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until peppers and apple are tender, about 25 minutes.
Make patties while relish is simmering: Preheat broiler.
Pulse bread, scallion, garlic, and mint in a food processor until finely chopped and add to lamb in a bowl along with egg, feta, salt, and pepper. Blend with your hands until just combined (do not overwork mixture, or patties will be tough). Form into 4 1/2-inch patties (about 1/2 inch thick).
Broil patties on oiled rack of a broiler pan 5 inches from heat until browned but still slightly pink in center, about 4 minutes on each side. Serve patties with relish.

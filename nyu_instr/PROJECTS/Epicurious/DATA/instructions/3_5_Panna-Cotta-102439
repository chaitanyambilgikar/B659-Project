Heat cream with sugar, simmering for 15 minutes. Sprinkle gelatin over 2 tablespoons of cream. Remove simmered cream from heat and add gelatin mixture, stirring to dissolve. Pour 1/2 cup of this new mixture into four lightly-oiled metal molds and refrigerate for 4-6 hours. Dip mold in hot water and run a knife around the edge; unmold panna cotta onto individual serving dishes. Serve each with 1-2 tablespoons sauce, either fruit puree, sweetened fruit or chocolate sauce. (Osteria Giusti uses saba — grape must cooked for 12 hours until thick — not worth attempting without a source of wine-grape must.)

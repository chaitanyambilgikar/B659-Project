Prepare a medium-hot fire (425° to 450°F) in a wood-fired grill.
Stir the sugar into the orange juice until dissolved. Brush the cut fruit with the sugar mixture.
Grill the fruit, cut side down, for about 5 minutes, or until the fruit is slightly soft and well marked. Move to indirect heat and continue to cook to the desired softness. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool.
Slice the fruit and keep each kind in a separate bowl. Let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes to allow flavors to mix.
Portion an assortment of the fruits into 6 bowls. Top with the zabaglione and garnish with mint leaves.

Steam potatoes until tender, about 10 minutes. Transfer potatoes to large bowl and mash. Steam fish until cooked through, about 10 minutes. Transfer fish to plate; cool 5 minutes. Flake fish and add to potatoes. Mix in shrimp, smoked salmon, green onions, dill and lemon peel. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Using about 1/3 cupful at a time, shape fish mixture into 12 balls; flatten into 1/2-inch-thick cakes. Place bread- crumbs in shallow bowl. Coat each cake with breadcrumbs, pressing to adhere.
Heat 3 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Working in batches, sauté fish cakes until brown and heated through, adding more oil as needed, about 3 minutes per side.
Divide fish cakes among 4 plates. Serve with lemon wedges.

1. For the marinade, combine pineapple juice, ketchup, soy sauce, and honey in a saucepan. Simmer 7 to 8 minutes to thicken. Cool. Cut the rack of ribs in half crosswise, if necessary. Cover with the cooled marinade and refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight.
2. Bake the ribs in a 350°F oven for 45 minutes, basting occasionally. When cooked through, finish them off on the grill, 3 inches from the heat source over medium heat. Grill 4 to 5 minutes per side, basting with the remaining marinade. Serve immediately.

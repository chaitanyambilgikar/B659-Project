1. Rinse, then drain, soaked ham hock. Place ham hock, large onion, celery, peppercorns, bay leaf, and thyme in a large saucepan. Cover with water. Bring to a boil, then simmer, partially covered, for 2 1/2 hours or until tender. Cool.
2. Strain ham stock through a fine-mesh sieve into a Tupperware or glass bowl with lid. Reserve the stock, and shred ham into bite-sized pieces. If stock is too spicy, distill with some water.
3. Rinse soaked peas until water runs clear.
4. In a large saucepan or pot over medium-low heat, melt butter. Sauté the onion until it is soft and translucent. Add carrot, peas, and the stock. Bring soup to a boil, then reduce to a simmer, and skim off any fat floating at the top.
5. Simmer until the peas are very soft, about 45 minutes. Purée soup in small batches using an immersion or regular blender. If too thick, add more stock. Return soup to saucepan, add leftover ham, then heat through. Serve in warm bowls, perhaps with chopped celery sprinkled on top.

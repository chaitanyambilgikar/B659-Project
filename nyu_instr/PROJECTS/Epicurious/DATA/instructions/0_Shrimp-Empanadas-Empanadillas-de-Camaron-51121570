To prepare the dough: 1. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a hook attachment, combine the flour, salt, sugar, and butter. Mix on medium speed to combine the ingredients, then add the beer.
2. Continue mixing to form a smooth, elastic dough, 4 to 5 minutes. Turn the dough out into a mixing bowl, and rest covered in the refrigerator for at least 15 minutes before using.
To prepare the filling: 1. In a medium skillet over low heat, melt the butter. Add the onion and garlic, and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 15 minutes.
2. Add the tomato, paprika, pinch of cloves, cumin, parsley, and shrimp, and cook until the shrimp are cooked through, 5 to 6 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste, and cool.
To form the empanadas: 1. Roll the dough out onto a floured surface to a thickness of about 1/4 inch. Cut out into 4-inch rounds. Brush the rounds with egg wash and fill each with about 1 1/2 tablespoons of shrimp filling. Fold over into a half moon and press the edges to seal (for a decorative touch, crimp the sealed edges with a fork). Repeat as needed to use up all of the dough and filling.
2. In a medium pot over medium-heat heat, add enough oil to come about 2 inches up the side of the pot. Heat the oil to 350°F. Set a cooling rack over a sheet pan and reserve nearby.
3. Working in batches, gently fry the empanadas until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Reserve cooked empanadas on the cooling screen while the remaining finish frying. Serve warm.

Cook 1/2 pound trimmed green beans in a large pot of boiling salted water until crisp-tender, 2-3 minutes; drain. Transfer to a bowl of ice water to cool; drain. Whisk 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons room-temperature unsalted butter with 2 teaspoons miso in a small bowl. Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add beans; season with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Toss to coat. Stir in 2 teaspoons minced shallot and 1 minced garlic clove; cook for 1 minute. Add 1/4 cup sake; cook until almost evaporated, 1-2 minutes. Add 1/4 cup vegetable broth or water; cook until sauce thickens and reduces by half, about 1 minute. Lower heat to medium; add miso butter and stir until a creamy sauce forms. Garnish with sesame seeds, if desired.

Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350°F. Lightly butter large nonstick cookie sheet. Blend first 5 ingredients in processor 1 minute. Using electric mixer, cream butter in medium bowl until light. Gradually beat in sugar mixture, egg whites and vanilla. Add flour and beat until combined.
Drop 1 teaspoon batter onto prepared cookie sheet. Using back of spoon, spread into 3-inch round. Repeat 5 more times, spacing cookies evenly. Bake until cookies are golden brown on edges, about 5 minutes.
Immediately run tip of small knife under edge of 1 cookie. Using fingertips, pick up cookie at lifted edge and turn over onto work surface. Working quickly, roll cookie around handle of wooden spoon, pressing cookie against handle as you roll. Slide cookie off handle. Repeat rolling with remaining cookies on sheet, returning sheet briefly to oven if cookies begin to harden.
Rinse cookie sheet under cold water. Dry with towel. Lightly butter cookie sheet. Repeat making cookies with remaining batter in batches, rinsing, drying and buttering sheet between each batch. Cool cookies. (Can be prepared 2 weeks ahead. Transfer to airtight container; store at room temperature.)

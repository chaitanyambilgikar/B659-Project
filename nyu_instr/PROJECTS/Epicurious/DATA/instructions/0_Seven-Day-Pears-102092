Peel, core and quarter the pears. Mix the vinegar, sugar and ginger in a large pot and add the pears. Add the pickling spices (tied in a cheesecloth bag). Bring to a rolling boil over a medium heat. Remove from heat and pour into a large bowl. The next day, drain off the juice, bring to a rolling boil and pour it back over the pears. Repeat for 5 more days. On the seventh day, discard the spice bag, pour the pears and juices into a large pot, bring to a rolling boil and ladle into hot, sterilized preserving jars Cover and seal. (The pears will shrink and turn amber color during this pickling process.)

Heat sugar in a dry heavy medium skillet over medium heat, stirring with a fork to heat sugar evenly, until it starts to melt. Stop stirring and cook, swirling skillet occasionally so sugar melts evenly, until it is dark amber.
Remove from heat and immediately add water (mixture will bubble up and steam), then cook over medium heat, stirring, until any solids are dissolved and mixture is smooth, about 2 minutes.
Remove from heat and add butter, swirling skillet until incorporated.
Serve peaches and ice cream with warm caramel sauce.

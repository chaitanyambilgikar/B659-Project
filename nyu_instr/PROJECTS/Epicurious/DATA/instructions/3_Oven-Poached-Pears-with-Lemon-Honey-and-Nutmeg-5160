Preheat oven to 400°F. Place large baking sheet in oven to heat. Cut 4 sheets of foil, each about 12 inches long. Place 1 foil sheet on work surface. Arrange 6 pear wedges, overlapping slightly, on 1 half of foil. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon honey. Sprinkle with 1 teaspoon currants, 1/4 teaspoon lemon peel and pinch of nutmeg. Fold foil over, enclosing contents completely and crimping edges tightly to seal. Repeat with remaining foil sheets, pears, honey, currants, lemon peel and nutmeg.
Place foil packets on heated baking sheet. Bake until pears are tender, about 5 minutes. Allow to cool completely.
Open foil packets into 4 shallow bowls to retain juices. Top each serving with 3 tablespoons vanilla yogurt.

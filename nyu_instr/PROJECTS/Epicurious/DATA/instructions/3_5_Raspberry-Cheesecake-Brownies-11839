Preheat the oven to 350°F. and butter and flour a 13-by-9 inch baking pan.
Make brownie bar: In a metal bowl set over a pan of barely simmering water melt chocolates with butter, stirring, and cool. Whisk in sugar and eggs, 1 at a time, and whisk in vanilla and salt. Whisk in flour until just combined and spread batter evenly in prepared pan.
Make cheesecake topping: In a bowl with an electric mixer cream together cream cheese and sugar until light and fluffy and beat in lemon juice, egg, vanilla, and salt. Beat in flour and spread mixture in an even layer over batter.
Scatter raspberries over topping and sprinkle with sugar.
Bake brownies in middle of oven 35 to 40 minutes, or until top is puffed and pale golden and a tester comes out with crumbs adhering to it. Cool brownies completely in pan on a rack and chill, covered, at least 6 hours or overnight.
Cut brownies into bars and sprinkle with confectioners' sugar.
Serve brownies cold or at room temperature.

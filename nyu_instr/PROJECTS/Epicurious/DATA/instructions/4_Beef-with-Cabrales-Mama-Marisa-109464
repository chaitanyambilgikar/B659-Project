1. Preheat the oven to 250°F.
2. Heat 6 tablespoons of the olive oil in an ovenproof skillet over medium heat. Rub the beef on all sides with salt and pepper. Add the beef to the skillet and cook, turning it as necessary, until browned on all sides, about 10 minutes.
3. Roast the beef tenderloin until the inside reaches 145°F at its thickest point, about 30 minutes. Let it rest 5 minutes before cutting.
4. Meanwhile, mash the peeled roasted garlic and mix with the Cabrales and brandy.
5. Carve the tenderloin into 1/2-inch slices. Sprinkle the slices with sea salt to taste and spread a little of the Cabrales mix on each. Sprinkle the chives over the beef and serve.

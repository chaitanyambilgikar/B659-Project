Whisk first 7 ingredients in medium bowl, then whisk in beer. Pour marinade into large resealable plastic bag. Add steaks, seal bag, and chill 1 day, turning bag occasionally.
Spray large ridged skillet or grill pan with nonstick spray and heat over medium-high heat. Remove steaks from marinade and pat dry; discard marinade. Place steaks in hot skillet and cook until well browned and thermometer inserted into center registers 125F to 130F for medium-rare, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer steaks to carving board and let rest 5 minutes.
Slice steaks thinly across grain. Arrange on platter; spoon any accumulated juices over and serve.

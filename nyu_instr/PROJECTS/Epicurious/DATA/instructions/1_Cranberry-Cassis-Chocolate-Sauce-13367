In a saucepan combine the cream, the sugar, the cranberries, and the cassis and simmer the mixture, stirring occasionally, for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the berries have burst. Remove the pan from the heat, stir in the chocolates, stirring until the mixture is smooth, and strain the mixture through a sieve into a bowl. The sauce keeps, covered and chilled, for 2 weeks. Serve the sauce warm over ice cream.

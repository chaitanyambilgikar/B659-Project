In a pan just large enough to hold them in a single layer, brown the veal shanks on both sides in oil over high heat. Remove the shanks, discard the oil, and return the shanks to the pan.
Pour over enough white wine to come a quarter of the way up the sides of the shanks. Simmer over medium heat until only a couple of tablespoons of liquid remain in the bottom of the pan.
Add julienned carrots, leeks, and turnips to the pan and pour over enough veal or chicken broth or water to come about halfway up the sides of the shanks. Bring to a gentle simmer on the stove.
Cover the pan and bake at 325°F for 2 hours, or until the shanks offer no resistance when poked with a skewer; the julienned vegetables will be meltingly tender. Check periodically to make sure the liquid isn't boiling; a bubble should rise to the surface only every 2 or 3 seconds.
Carefully transfer the shanks to individual soup plates, place a mound of the julienned vegetables on each shank, and ladle over the hot braising liquid. (If the braising liquid seems to thin, reduce it slightly; if it seems greasy, transfer it to a saucepan and remove the fat with a spoon or small ladle or with a degreasing cup.)

Bring chicken, water, soy sauce, sugar, Sherry, ginger, and star anise to a simmer, covered, in a 3-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat. Cook until meat is tender, about 10 minutes.
Transfer chicken to a serving bowl and keep warm, covered.
Skim off any fat from sauce and boil sauce until syrupy and reduced by half, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir cornstarch mixture and whisk into sauce. Boil, whisking, until thickened and shiny, about 1 minute. Discard ginger and star anise.
Pour sauce over chicken and sprinkle with scallions.

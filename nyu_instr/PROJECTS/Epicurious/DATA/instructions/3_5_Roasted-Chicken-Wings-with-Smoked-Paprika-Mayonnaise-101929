Cut off wing tips, reserving for another use, and halve wings at joint. Put wings in a large sealable plastic bag. Finely chop garlic and add to bag with wine, water, paprika, vinegar, sugar, and salt. Seal bag, pressing out excess air. Marinate wings in bag in a large bowl, chilled, turning bag once, at least 8 hours and up to 24.
Preheat oven to 400°F.
Arrange wings in a roasting pan or large shallow baking pan large enough to hold them in one layer and pour marinade over them. Roast wings in middle of oven 30 minutes. Turn wings over and roast until marinade is reduced to a glaze and wings are golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes more.
Make mayonnaise: In a bowl whisk together all mayonnaise ingredients. Serve wings with mayonnaise.

Soak skewers in water 15 minutes. Heat broiler; coat a broiler pan with cooking spray. In a bowl, stir cornstarch into 1 tablespoon hot sauce until smooth; stir in remaining hot sauce. Add chicken; toss to coat. Thread chicken lengthwise on skewers; reserve remaining hot sauce mixture. Place chicken in pan so skewers hang off edge; cover exposed sticks with aluminum foil. Broil 4 minutes. Turn chicken; brush with remaining sauce. Broil until chicken is cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes. In another bowl, combine blue cheese and dressing. Serve chicken with vegetable sticks and blue cheese dipping sauce.

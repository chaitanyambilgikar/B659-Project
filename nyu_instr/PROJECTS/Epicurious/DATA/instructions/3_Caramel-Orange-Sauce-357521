Very thinly slice 1 orange into rounds (about 1/16 to 1/8 inch thick). Remove any seeds. Place slices in medium bowl and add 1/2 cup sugar; let stand at room temperature 1 hour.
Combine 1 cup sugar and 1/4 cup water in heavy large saucepan. Stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat; boil without stirring until syrup is deep amber, occasionally brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush and swirling pan, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat. Carefully add orange-sugar mixture to caramel (mixture will bubble up). Return pan to medium heat; simmer until orange slices are tender, stirring occasionally, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool 10 minutes.
Transfer orange mixture to processor; add butter and coarse salt and process until orange slices are very finely chopped. Pour mixture through fine strainer set over bowl, pressing on solids to release as much liquid as possible (sauce will be thick). Cool. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and chill. Rewarm before using.
Using sharp knife, cut off peel and white pith from 4 oranges. Working over bowl to catch juices and using small sharp knife, cut between membranes to release segments into bowl. Mix orange segments and juices from bowl into warm sauce.

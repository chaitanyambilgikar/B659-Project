To make the patties, mix all the ingredients in a large bowl and form into 4 patties.
Set up the outdoor grill for direct-heat cooking over medium-high heat. Place the patties on the grill and cook for 5 minutes, then turn and continue cooking for a couple of minutes until just done. A minute before you finish cooking the patties, lay the cheese slices on the patties and let melt. Remove and set aside to keep warm.
Meanwhile, place a griddle, plancha or piastra suitable for an outdoor grill on the grill to preheat. Cook the onion on the griddle until golden. Cook the bacon on the griddle to your liking.
Butter the rolls and place, butter side down, on the grill and cook until just golden with a bit of crunch to them. Remove and construct your burger starting with some sauce, the patties with cheese, then the bacon, onion, tomato, cornichons and arugula.

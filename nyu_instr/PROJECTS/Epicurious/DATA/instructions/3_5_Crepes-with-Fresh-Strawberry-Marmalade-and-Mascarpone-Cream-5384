Stir first 3 ingredients in medium bowl to blend. Cover mascarpone cream; chill.
Stir strawberry preserves in heavy small saucepan over low heat until melted. Spread 1/2 tablespoon preserves over 1 side of each crepe. Fold crepes in half, enclosing preserves. Fold crepes in half again, forming triangles.
Mix sugar and cinnamon in small bowl. Spread butter over both sides of crepes. Sprinkle cinnamon sugar over both sides of crepes. Transfer to baking sheet. (Can be made 6 hours ahead. Cover crepes and refrigerate. Keep mascarpone cream refrigerated.)
Preheat oven to 200°F. Spray large nonstick skillet with vegetable oil spray and heat over medium-high heat. Add 6 crepes to skillet. Sauté until sugar begins to caramelize, about 45 seconds per side. Transfer crepes to another baking sheet; keep warm in oven. Repeat with remaining crepes, wiping skillet and spraying with vegetable oil spray before each batch.
Arrange 3 crepes on each plate. Spoon Fresh strawberry marmalade over crepes. Spoon dollops of mascarpone cream atop marmalade and serve.

Preheat oven to 400°F. Rinse hen halves and pat dry. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Line rimmed baking sheet with foil. Arrange hen halves, skin side up, on prepared baking sheet.
Combine plum jam, chutney, and curry powder in small saucepan. Stir over low heat until curried plum glaze comes to boil. Brush 2 tablespoons glaze over each hen half, coating generously. Add chicken broth to remaining glaze and reserve for sauce.
Bake hen halves until golden and tender, about 25 minutes. Transfer hen halves to plates. Squeeze fresh lime juice over each hen half. Pour pan juices into reserved glaze mixture and bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer to thicken slightly, about 3 minutes. Spoon sauce around hen halves. Sprinkle with chopped green onions and chopped peanuts.

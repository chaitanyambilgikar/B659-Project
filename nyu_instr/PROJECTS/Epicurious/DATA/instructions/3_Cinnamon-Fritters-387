Mix sugar and cinnamon in shallow bowl. Set aside. Combine 3/4 cup water, butter and salt in heavy medium saucepan. Stir over medium heat until butter melts. Increase heat and bring to boil. Add flour all at once and stir with wooden spoon to blend. Stir over medium heat until dough forms a ball in center of pan, about 1 minute. Transfer dough to bowl. Using electric mixer, beat dough until slightly cool, about 15 seconds. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating until blended after each addition.
Heat vegetable oil in heavy large deep saucepan to 370°F. Working in batches, carefully drop mounded 1/2 teaspoonfuls of dough into hot oil and cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes per batch. Using slotted spoon, transfer fritters to paper towels and drain 20 seconds. Immediately roll fritters in cinnamon sugar. Serve fritters hot; or cool up to 3 hours and serve fritters at room temperature.

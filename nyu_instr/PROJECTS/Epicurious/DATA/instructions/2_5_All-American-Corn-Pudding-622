Preheat oven to 375°F. Spray 8x8x2-inch glass baking dish with nonstick vegetable oil spray. Puree 1 1/4 cups corn kernels and cornstarch in processor until almost smooth; set aside.
Melt butter in small skillet over low heat. Add green onions; sauté 3 minutes. Whisk eggs, egg white, milk, stock, sugar, salt, pepper and nutmeg in large bowl to blend. Add corn puree, green onions, 1 tablespoon Parmesan and remaining 3/4 cup corn kernels and stir until blended.
Pour mixture into prepared dish. Sprinkle remaining 1 tablespoon Parmesan over. Place dish in large roasting pan. Pour enough hot water into roasting pan to come halfway up sides of dish. Bake until pudding is just set and light golden, about 45 minutes. Remove dish from water and let stand 5 minutes. Cut into squares and serve.

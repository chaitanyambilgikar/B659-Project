Microwave first 3 ingredients in medium bowl until jam and butter melt, about 20 seconds. Stir to blend. Stir lime peel into glaze. Thread 4 shrimp onto each skewer. DO AHEAD: Glaze and shrimp can be made 8 hours ahead.
Cover separately and chill. Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Sprinkle shrimp with sea salt. Place 3 tablespoons glaze in bowl; set aside. Brush shrimp with some of remaining glaze. Grill shrimp until just opaque in center, brushing occasionally with glaze, about 2 minutes per side. Drizzle with reserved glaze and serve.

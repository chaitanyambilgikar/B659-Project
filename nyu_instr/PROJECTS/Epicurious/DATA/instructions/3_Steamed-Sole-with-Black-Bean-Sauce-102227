Thoroughly rinse the fish in cold water and pat dry. Sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon salt over the outside and into the cavity of the fish.
Rinse the black beans in several changes of cold water and drain them. In a small bowl, mash beans, garlic, and sugar with the back of a wooden spoon. Stir in sesame oil, rice wine, pepper, and 1/8 teaspoon salt.
Place fish in a 9-inch shallow heatproof bowl and spread black beans over fish on both sides and in cavity.
Bring water to a boil over high heat in a covered steamer large enough to fit the dish without touching the sides of the steamer. Carefully place dish into steamer, cover, and steam 5 minutes. Turn off heat and let stand, covered, 4 minutes. Test fish for doneness by poling the thickest part with a fork or chopstick; flesh should flake. If not, resteam for 1 to 2 minutes or until fish just flakes. Carefully remove the dish from the steamer and pour off any liquid in the dish.
In a small skillet, heat oil until hot but not smoking over high heat. Sprinkle ginger and scallion over fish. The oil will make a crackling sound as it hits the fish. Serve immediately.

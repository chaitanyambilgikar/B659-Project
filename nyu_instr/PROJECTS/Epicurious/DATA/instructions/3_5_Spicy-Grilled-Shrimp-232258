Whisk first 8 ingredients in small bowl.
Thread 6 shrimp onto each of six 10- to 12-inch-long metal skewers. Place skewers in 15x10x2-inch glass baking dish. Spoon all but 1/4 cup marinade over shrimp; turn to coat. Cover and chill shrimp and reserved 1/4 cup marinade at least 30 minutes and up to 2 hours.
Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Grill shrimp with some marinade still clinging until just opaque in center, about 2 1/2 minutes per side. Arrange skewers on platter. Spoon reserved 1/4 cup marinade over and serve.

In a kettle cook the potato, peeled and diced, and the onion in the oil over moderately low heat until the onion is softened, add 1 cup water, and simmer the mixture, covered, for 5 to 10 minutes, or until the potato is tender. In a blender purée the mixture with the milk and in the kettle combine the mixture with the roasted peppers, the Worcestershire sauce, and the Tabasco. Heat the mixture over moderately low heat, stirring in handfuls of the Cheddar, until the Cheddar is melted and the soup is hot (but do not let it boil), and garnish the soup with the coriander and the croutons.

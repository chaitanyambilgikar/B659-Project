Heat oil in a medium pan over low heat. Cook onion until golden brown, about 30 minutes. (Add 1 to 2 tablespoons water if onions stick.) Add 1/4 teaspoon sea salt; set aside. Place a grater over a bowl. Rub cut surfaces of tomatoes across grater. Discard skins. Add remaining ¼ tsp salt. Spread grated tomato over toasts (about 1 teaspoon per toast). Top with onion and tuna. Garnish with chives.

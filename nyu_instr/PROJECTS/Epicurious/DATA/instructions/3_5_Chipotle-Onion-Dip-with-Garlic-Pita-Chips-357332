Melt butter with olive oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions; sprinkle lightly with sea salt and sauté until onions begin to turn golden brown, stirring frequently, about 15 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and continue to sauté until onions are deep golden brown, about 10 minutes longer. Remove from heat and cool onions to room temperature.

Transfer to serving bowl. Cover; chill at least 1 hour. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Keep refrigerated.

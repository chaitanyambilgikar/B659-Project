Make swordfish conserva: In heavy deep 12-inch sauté pan over moderate heat, heat oil until deep-fat thermometer registers 170°F. Carefully add garlic, basil, and red pepper flakes. Gently lower fish into oil and poach fish, adjusting heat to maintain temperature at 170°F, until fish is tender and no longer translucent, about 20 minutes. Carefully transfer both fish and oil to large heatproof bowl and refrigerate, uncovered, until cool, about 30 minutes.
Make polenta: In 6-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat, combine milk and cream. Bring to boil, then gradually whisk in polenta. Cook, whisking constantly, until polenta starts to bubble, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer, whisking for 1 minute every 10 minutes, until liquid is absorbed and polenta is thick and soft, about 45 minutes. Stir in tarragon, parsley, nutmeg, salt, pepper, and butter.
Assemble and serve: In small bowl, stir together tarragon, parsley, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Remove swordfish from oil (discard oil) and pat dry.
Ladle 3/4 cup polenta into each of 8 warm bowls and top each with 1 swordfish steak. Top each steak with 1 teaspoon herb mixture and serve.

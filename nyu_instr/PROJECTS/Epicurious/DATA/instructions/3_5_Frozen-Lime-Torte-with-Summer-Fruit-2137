For Nut crust: Finely chop first 4 ingredients in processor, using on/off turns. Add butter and blend until moist crumbs form. Transfer 3 1/2 cups nut mixture to 10-inch-diameter springform pan with 2 1/2-inch-high sides; transfer remaining nut mixture to 6-inch-diameter springform pan with 2 1/2-inch-high sides. Using plastic wrap as aid, press crumbs firmly up sides, then over bottom of each pan, covering completely. Freeze.
For Lime Filling: Combine first 5 ingredients in medium metal bowl. Place bowl over saucepan of simmering water (do not allow bottom of bowl to touch water). Whisk constantly until candy thermometer registers 170°F, about 5 minutes. Remove bowl from over water. Add white chocolate and whisk until melted and smooth. Freeze lime mixture until cold and thickened, whisking occasionally, about 45 minutes.
Beat cream in large bowl until stiff. Pour lime mixture over whipped cream; using rubber spatula, fold lime mixture and cream together. Divide between crust. Cover and freeze overnight.
For Blackberry Sauce: Bring all ingredients to boil in heavy medium saucepan, stirring frequently. Cool slightly. Puree mixture in batches in processor. Strain through sieve set over bowl, pressing on solids. Chill until cold. (Can be made 1 day ahead.)
For Assembly: Using electric mixer, beat cream and sugar in large bowl until peaks form. Run sharp knife around pan sides to loosen torte tiers. Release pan sides. Center 6-inch tier on its pan bottom atop 10-inch tier. Spread whipped cream over sides (not tops) of tiers, covering crusts completely. Freeze until firm, about 30 minutes. (Can be prepared 2 days ahead. Wrap in plastic; keep frozen.)
Transfer tiered torte to platter. Mound fruit decoratively atop torte. Garnish with mint. To serve, slide spatula under 6-inch tier and transfer to work surface. Cut tiers into wedges. Serve with sauce and additional fruit.

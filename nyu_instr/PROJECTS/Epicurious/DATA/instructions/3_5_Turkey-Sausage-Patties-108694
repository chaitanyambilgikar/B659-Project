Makes 4 servings. Stir together all ingredients except oil in a large bowl until combined well.
Form 1/4 cups of sausage mixture into patties (3 inches in diameter; about 8 total) using moistened hands and arrange on a wax-paper-lined tray.
Lightly brush a 12-inch nonstick skillet with oil and heat over moderate heat until hot but not smoking.
Cook patties in batches of 4, turning over once, until browned and cooked through, about 6 minutes per batch. Transfer to a plate as cooked and keep warm, covered with foil.

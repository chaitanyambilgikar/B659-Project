Heat 1 tablespoon oil in large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add fenugreek seeds, nigella seeds, and mustard seeds. Cover and cook until seeds sizzle and begin to pop, about 45 seconds. Add garlic and stir 1 minute. Add tomatoes with juices, coriander, 1/2 teaspoon turmeric, and 1/4 teaspoon cayenne. Boil over medium heat until juices evaporate and mixture thickens, stirring occasionally, 12 minutes. Season chutney with salt and pepper. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Rewarm over low heat, stirring often.)
Mix 1/2 teaspoon turmeric and 1/4 teaspoon cayenne in small bowl. Sprinkle spice mixture over both sides of fish fillets; rub into fish to adhere. Sprinkle fish with salt. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add fish fillets and cook until opaque in center, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer fish to plates. Top each with warm chutney. Garnish with lemon slices and serve.

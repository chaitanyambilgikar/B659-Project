Preheat oven to 400° F. and lightly flour a baking sheet.
In a bowl whisk together yolk, sour cream, and salt and pepper to taste. Arrange pastry squares on baking sheet and spoon one fourth of mixture onto center of each. Top mixture with artichokes and tomatoes. Spoon remaining sour cream mixture over vegetables and sprinkle with thyme.
Bake tarts in middle of oven until pastry is golden, about 12 minutes.

In a small heatproof bowl sprinkle gelatin over 1/4 cup consommé to soften 1 minute.
In a small saucepan bring remaining consommé just to a boil and remove pan from heat. Stir hot consommé into gelatin mixture, continuing to stir until mixture is dissolved completely, and cool.
In a blender combine cream cheese, consommé mixture, curry powder, and garlic and blend 30 seconds. Pour dip through a fine sieve into a medium serving bowl. Chop coriander and stir into dip. Chill dip, covered, 6 hours, or until thickened (dip will not set firm).
Serve dip with breadsticks and crudités.

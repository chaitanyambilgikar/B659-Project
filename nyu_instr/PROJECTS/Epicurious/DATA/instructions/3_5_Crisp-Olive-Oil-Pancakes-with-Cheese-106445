Stir flour and salt in large bowl to blend. Using rubber spatula, mix in 1/4 cup oil, then egg. Gradually stir in 3/4 cup warm water to form soft dough. Knead in bowl until smooth and elastic, flouring lightly if necessary, about 5 minutes. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest 20 minutes.
Cut dough into 4 equal pieces; cover 3 pieces with plastic. Roll out remaining piece on work surface to 13-inch rope. Cut rope into 10 equal pieces. Roll 1 piece at a time into 5-inch rope. Dip fingers in oil and flatten rope to 1-inch-wide ribbon. Roll ribbon tightly into coil. Stand coil up on 1 end. Flatten slightly and roll out coil to 3-inch-diameter round. Cover round with plastic. Repeat with remaining dough, covering rounds with plastic to prevent drying.
Pour enough oil into heavy large saucepan to reach depth of 1/2 inch. Attach deep-fry thermometer to side of pan; heat oil to 350°F. Fry dough rounds in batches until golden brown, about 1 1/2 minutes per side. Transfer pancakes to paper towels to drain. Sprinkle warm pancakes with cheese. Serve warm or at room temperature.

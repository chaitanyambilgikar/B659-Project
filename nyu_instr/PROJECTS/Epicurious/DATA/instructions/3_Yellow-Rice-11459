In a large bowl wash the rice in several changes of cold water until the water runs clear and drain it well in a large sieve. In a large heavy saucepan heat the oil over moderately high heat until it is hot but not smoking, add the rice, and sauté it, stirring, for 1 to 2 minutes, or until it begins to turn opaque and is coated well. Add the water, the salt, and the turmeric and boil the rice, uncovered and without stirring, until the surface of the rice is covered with stem holes and the grains on the top appear dry (about 8 to 10 minutes). Reduce the heat to as low as possible, cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid, and cook the rice for 15 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and let the rice stand, covered, for 5 minutes. Fluff the rice with a fork and transfer it to a heated serving dish.

In a bowl whisk together the shallots, the vinegar, the parsley, the minced tarragon, and with salt and pepper to taste, add the oil in a stream, whisking, and whisk the dressing until it is emulsified. Add the arugula, the chicken, and the melon balls, toss the salad until it is combined well, and garnish it with the tarragon sprigs.

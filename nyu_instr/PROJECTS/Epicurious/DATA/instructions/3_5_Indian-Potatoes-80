Heat oil in heavy large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add garlic, ginger, turmeric, coriander and paprika and sauté 1 minute. Mix in potatoes, then broth. Cover and cook 5 minutes. Uncover, increase heat to medium-high and cook until potatoes are tender and liquid is reduced to glaze, stirring gently, about 8 minutes more. Season generously with salt and pepper. Drizzle lemon juice over. Sprinkle with chopped cilantro and serve.

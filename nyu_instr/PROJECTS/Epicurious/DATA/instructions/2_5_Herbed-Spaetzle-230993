Bring a 4- to 6-quart heavy pot of salted water to a boil and keep at a bare simmer. Fill a large bowl with very cold water and set aside.
Whisk together flour and 1 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl. Whisk together milk, eggs, and crème fraîche in another bowl, then whisk into flour until batter is smooth.
Working over barely simmering water, force half of batter through spaetzlemaker, food mill, or colander.
As spaetzle float to surface (after about 1 minute), transfer to bowl of cold water with a mesh skimmer or sieve, then into a large sieve to drain. Repeat with remaining batter. Toss drained spaetzle with oil.
Cut 1 stick butter into pieces, then heat in a deep 12-inch heavy nonstick skillet over moderately high heat until foam subsides and add spaetzle. (Skillet will be full.) Sauté, stirring occasionally, until golden on the edges, 10 to 15 minutes. Cut remaining 1/2 stick butter into pieces and add to spaetzle along with parsley, chives, thyme, sage, nutmeg, remaining 3/4 teaspoon salt, and pepper. Gently stir to coat.

Preheat oven to 350°F. Line 11x7-inch glass baking dish with foil. Combine first 3 ingredients in medium bowl; whisk to blend. Using electric mixer, beat butter in large bowl until light and fluffy. Add sugar and beat until light. Beat in vanilla and almond extracts. Add flour mixture and beat just until dough begins to come together. Mix in almonds. Press dough onto bottom of prepared dish. Pierce all over with fork. Bake until just firm to touch, about 45 minutes.
Stir preserves in small saucepan over medium-low heat until melted and hot; spread over warm pastry. Bake until preserves bubble in center, about 15 minutes. Cool in dish on rack.
Using foil as aid, lift entire cookie from dish; trim edges. Cut into 2x1-inch bars. (Can be prepared 2 days ahead. Cover and store in single layer in refrigerator.)

Cut a small X in skin of blossom end of each tomato. Blanch tomatoes, 5 at a time, in a saucepan of boiling water 3 seconds and immediately transfer with a slotted spoon to a bowl of ice and cold water to stop cooking.
Drain and peel, transferring to a large shallow dish.
Stir together vodka, vinegar, sugar, and zest until sugar is dissolved, then pour over tomatoes, gently tossing to coat. Marinate, covered and chilled, at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour.
Stir together salt and pepper and serve with tomatoes for dipping.

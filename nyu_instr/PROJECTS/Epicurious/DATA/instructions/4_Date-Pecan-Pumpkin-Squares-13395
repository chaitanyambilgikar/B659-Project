Into a bowl sift together the flour, the baking powder, the cinnamon, the nutmeg, the cloves, and the salt. In another bowl with an electric mixer cream the butter and the sugar, add the eggs, 1 at a time, beating, and beat in the pumpkin, the vanilla, and 1/4 cup water. In a small bowl toss the dates with 1/4 cup of the flour mixture until they are coated well. Gradually add the remaining flour mixture to the pumpkin mixture, beating slowly, and stir in the date mixture and the pecans, stirring until the batter is combined well. Pour the batter into a greased baking pan, 13 by 9 by 2 inches, and bake the cake in the middle of a preheated 350°F. oven for 1 hour, or until a tester comes out clean. Let the cake cool on a rack, cut it into 12 squares, and serve it with the nutmeg ice cream and the bourbon burnt sugar sauce.

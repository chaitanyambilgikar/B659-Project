Preheat oven to 325°F. Place half and half in heavy medium saucepan. Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add bean. Bring to simmer. Remove from heat. Cover; steep 15 minutes. Discard vanilla bean.
Whisk yolks, sugar, bourbon, 1/8 teaspoon nutmeg and salt in large bowl to blend. Gradually whisk in hot half and half mixture. Strain custard into 4-cup glass measuring cup.
Place six 3/4-cup custard cups or soufflé dishes in roasting pan. Divide custard equally among cups. Cover each cup with foil. Pour enough hot water into pan to come halfway up sides of custard cups. Bake until custard is just set around edges but still soft in center, about 45 minutes. Remove cups from water. Remove foil and cool. Cover custards and chill until cold, at least 2 hours. (Can be prepared 3 days ahead. Keep refrigerated.)
Sprinkle additional nutmeg over custards. Garnish with strawberries.

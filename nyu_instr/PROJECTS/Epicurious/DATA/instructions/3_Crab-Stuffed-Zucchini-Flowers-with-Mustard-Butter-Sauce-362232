Combine the crabmeat, crème fraîche, lemon juice and zest, and chives in a mixing bowl. Season to taste with salt, white pepper and piment d'Espelette. Using a small spoon or a piping bag, gently stuff each zucchini flower three-quarters full with the crab mixture.
Bring the water to a boil in a heavy small saucepan over medium heat and whisk in the butter 1 tablespoon at a time until the all of the butter is emulsified. Whisk in both mustards and season to taste with salt and pepper. Set the butter sauce aside and keep warm.
Place a large pot filled with 2 inches of water over high heat and bring to a boil. Place the stuffed zucchini flowers in a steamer insert, then set the steamer in the pot. Cover and steam until the crab filling is hot, about 3 minutes.
Place 3 zucchini flowers on each of 4 plates. Stir the chives into the mustard butter sauce, spoon the sauce over and around the stuffed flowers and serve immediately.

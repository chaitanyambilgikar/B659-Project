Finely grind nuts, flour and salt in processor. Using electric mixer, beat 1/2 cup powdered sugar, butter and vanilla and almond extracts in large bowl until light. Add nut mixture and beat just until blended. Cover; chill until firm, about 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 350°F. Lightly butter 2 heavy large baking sheets. For each cookie, roll 1 rounded tablespoonful dough into cylinder; pinch ends to taper. Place in crescent shape on baking sheet. Bake until bottoms of cookies are just golden, about 15 minutes. Transfer baking sheets to racks. Cool cookies. Sift 1/4 cup powdered sugar over. (Can be made 3 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.)

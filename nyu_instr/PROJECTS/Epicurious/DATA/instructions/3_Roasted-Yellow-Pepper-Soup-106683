1. Lay 6 pepper halves, cut-side down, on a baking sheet; broil until well charred, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a plastic bag; seal for 10 minutes. Slip off and discard the skins. Coarsely chop the roasted peppers, then set aside.
2. Melt the butter in a soup pot. Add the onions, leeks, salt, and pepper; sauté over low heat about 10 to 15 minutes or until the vegetables are soft.
3. Coarsely chop the remaining 6 pepper halves; add to the pot with the potatoes, reserved roasted peppers and 5 cups broth. Simmer, uncovered, until the vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes. Cool to room temperature.
4. Puree in a food processor, adding a bit more broth if it's too thick. Refrigerate to chill. Serve in tiny cups, garnished with the chives.

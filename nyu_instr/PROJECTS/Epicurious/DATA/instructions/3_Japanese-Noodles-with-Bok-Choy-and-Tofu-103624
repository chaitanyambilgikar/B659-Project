Whisk soy sauce, vinegar, honey, 1 tablespoon oil and cornstarch in small bowl to blend. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add onions, garlic and ginger and stir 30 seconds. Add bok choy and sauté until beginning to wilt, about 2 minutes. Mix in tofu, then noodles and soy mixture. Stir until sauce thickens and coats noodle mixture, about 1 minute. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

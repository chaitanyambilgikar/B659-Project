Warm the oil in a pot over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, and salt and pepper to taste; cook 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Add the beans, broth, 1/4 cup water, thyme, and saffron, and bring all to a boil. Reduce the heat and cook for 20 minutes.
Remove half of the stew; purée it in a blender or food processor. Return the purée to the pot. (Alternatively, you may use an immersion blender briefly to purée the stew directly in the pot.) Add the escarole. Simmer for 5 minutes until the escarole is tender, adding more water if the mixture is too thick.

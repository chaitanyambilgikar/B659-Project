In a very small saucepan simmer water and 1 tablespoon sugar until sugar is dissolved, about 1 minute, and in a small bowl toss with blueberries and mint. Chill blueberry mixture, covered, 15 minutes, or until cold. Divide blueberries between 2 Martini glasses.
In a chilled bowl with an electric mixer beat cream with remaining tablespoon sugar until it just holds stiff peaks and fold in zest. Top blueberries with lemon cream.

1. Preheat oven to 375°F. Drain all liquid from cooked cauliflower, ease whole head into 9-inch pie pan generously coated with nonstick baking spray, and set aside.
2. Melt butter in small heavy saucepan over moderately low heat. Add scallions and cook, stirring occasionally, 2 to 3 minutes until limp. Blend in flour, salt, pepper, and nutmeg and cook and stir 3 minutes.
3. Whisking constantly, add half-and-half in slow, steady stream and continue whisking 5 to 8 minutes until thickened and no raw floury taste lingers. Add cheese and stir until melted. Carefully pour sauce over cauliflower and sprinkle with Topping.
4. Slide onto middle oven shelf and bake uncovered about 20 minutes until lightly browned.
5. Ease breaded cauliflower onto heated round platter and serve as an accompaniment to roast beef, lamb, or pork. Good, too, with roast chicken or turkey or baked ham.

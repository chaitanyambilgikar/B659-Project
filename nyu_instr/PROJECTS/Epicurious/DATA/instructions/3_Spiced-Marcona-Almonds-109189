Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350°F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment.
Whisk together egg white, salt, cumin, and paprika in a bowl, then add almonds and toss to coat. Spread almonds evenly on baking sheet and roast until golden, about 20 minutes.
Transfer nuts on parchment to a rack and cool completely (almonds will crisp as they cool). Loosen nuts from parchment with a spatula and transfer to a bowl.

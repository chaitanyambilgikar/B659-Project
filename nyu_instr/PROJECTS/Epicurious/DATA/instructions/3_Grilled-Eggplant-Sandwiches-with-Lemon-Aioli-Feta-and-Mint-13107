Preheat grill.
Brush eggplant with oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill eggplant in batches on a rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals, turning once, until tender, about 3 minutes, transferring as cooked with tongs to a baking sheet to cool. (Alternatively, eggplant may be broiled for about the same amount of time.)
In a small bowl whisk together mayonnaise, garlic, and lemon juice to make aïoli.
Cut bread into four 4-inch-long pieces and halve each piece horizontally. Spread 4 halves with aïoli. Make sandwiches on bread with eggplant, feta, and mint.

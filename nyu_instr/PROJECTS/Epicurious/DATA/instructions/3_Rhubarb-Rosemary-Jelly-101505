Cut enough rhubarb crosswise into 1/2-inch slices to measure 3 cups. In a 4-quart kettle bring rhubarb, 1 1/2 cups water, sugar, vinegar, and rosemary to a boil and simmer 15 minutes (rhubarb will disintegrate).
While rhubarb is simmering, in a small bowl sprinkle gelatin over remaining 1/4 cup water and let soften 1 minute. Remove kettle from heat and stir gelatin mixture into rhubarb mixture until gelatin is just dissolved.
Pour mixture through a fine sieve into a large bowl, gently pressing on solids, and discard solids. Skim off any foam and immediately pour jelly into sterilized jars, filling to within 1/8 inch of tops. Wipe rims of jars with a dampened cloth and seal jars with lids. Cool jars completely. Rhubarb rosemary jelly keeps, chilled, 2 months.

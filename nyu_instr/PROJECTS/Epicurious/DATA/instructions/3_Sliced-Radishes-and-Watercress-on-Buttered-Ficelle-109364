Spread some butter over bread slices. Sprinkle with fleur de sel. Top each bread slice with 2 watercress sprigs. Spread 1 side of each radish slice with butter. Place 2 radish slices atop watercress, buttered side down, overlapping slightly if necessary to fit. Top with flowers or sprouts, if desired. (Can be made 1 hour ahead. Cover; let stand at room temperature.)
*Available at Italian markets and some specialty foods stores.

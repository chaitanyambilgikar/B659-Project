In a skillet cook the onion and the sliced fennel in 2 tablespoons of the butter, covered, over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, for 12 minutes, or until the fennel is just tender. Stir in the Sherry and boil the mixture, uncovered, for 1 minute. Stir in the cream, the vinegar, the fennel seeds, and salt and pepper to taste, cook the mixture over moderate heat, stirring, adding the water as needed to thin the sauce if desired, for 30 seconds. Transfer the mixture to a bowl and keep it warm.
In the skillet, cleaned, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon butter over moderately high heat until the foam subsides and in it sauté the snapper, starting skin sides down, for 3 minutes on each side, or until it just flakes. Divide the onion and fennel mixture between 2 heated plates and arrange a snapper fillet on each plate.

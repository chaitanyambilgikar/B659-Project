Pass the tomatoes through a food mill fitted with the fine disc or crush them as fine as possible in a bowl with a wire whisk.
In a medium-size nonreactive saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and simmer until wilted. Add the carrots and celery and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 10 minutes. Add the tomatoes and bay leaves, season lightly with salt and peperoncino, and heat to a simmer. Simmer the sauce over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally until thickened, about 45 mintues. Remove the bay leaves. Check the seasoning and add more salt and peperoncino if necessary.

Stem, core, and quarter bell peppers; place on a baking sheet. Toss with sliced garlic, thyme, and extra-virgin olive oil; season with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Arrange skin side down in a single layer and roast in a 425°F oven until softened, then top with Parmesan and broil until cheese is melted and peppers are slightly charred. Squeeze the lemon juice over peppers.

1. Preheat oven to 375°F. Prepare baking sheets by spraying lightly with Pam.
2. Cream butter, both sugars, and vanilla. Beat in egg. Add baking soda and flour mixing only until smooth. Fold in chocolate chips. Use 16x24-inch baking sheets and drop cookies in 3 rows of 4.
3. Bake cookies, two baking sheets at a time. After 5 minutes take cookies out of the oven and rap on the stovetop until they deflate. Then return sheets to oven, placing the top sheet on the bottom rack, and the bottom sheet on the top rack. Continue to bake until cookies are golden brown, 4-6 more minutes.
4. Transfer immediately from cookie sheet to wire rack for cooling.

Mix all the ingredients together into a paste in a small bowl and rub it all over the lamb. Place the lamb in a shallow bowl and cover with any remaining marinade. Marinate for about 2 hours at room temperature, or, preferably, cover the lamb and marinate overnight in the refrigerator, turning the meat from time to time.
To grill lamb chops: Depending on their thickness, grill the chops over medium-hot coals for 3 to 5 minutes per side, turning once or twice. The chops should register 120° to 135°F at the thickest part for rare to medium rare. You can also broil them 3 inches from the flame for 3 to 5 minutes per side, or until cooked as above.
To grill kebabs: Skewer the marinated lamb chunks on wooden or metal skewers, alternating with chunks of onions or peppers, if desired. Grill until the meat reaches 130° to 135°F for medium-rare to medium.
To grill a lamb leg: You may want to insert long metal skewers crosswise in the butterflied leg to hold it flat. Grill the leg over medium-hot coals, turning often, for 20 to 30 minutes. At its thickest point, the meat should register 120° to 130°F for rare to medium-rare; thinner parts will them be medium-rare to medium. Let the lamb rest, covered loosely with foil, for 5 to 10 minutes before slicing on the diagonal and serving. The internal temperature will rise 5° to 10°F more.

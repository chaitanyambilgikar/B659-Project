Steam squid bodies and tentacles until tender, about 3 minutes. Transfer to plate and cool to lukewarm.
Cut squid bodies into 1/2-inch-wide rings. Cut squid tentacles in half if large. Transfer squid to large bowl. Add baby arugula, cherry tomatoes, beans, olive oil, and 2 tablespoons lemon juice. Toss gently to blend, adding more lemon juice, if desired. Season with salt and pepper.

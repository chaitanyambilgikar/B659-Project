Melt butter in large deep skillet over medium-high heat. Add garlic and shallots; sauté 1 minute. Add shiitake and crimini mushrooms and sauté 5 minutes. Add chanterelles; sauté until all mushrooms are tender, about 5 minutes longer. Add wine and boil until reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Add cream and simmer until liquid is reduced to sauce consistency, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Stir in peas and parsley. Remove from heat. Season sauce with salt and pepper. Cover to keep warm.
Meanwhile, cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally. Drain, reserving 1 cup pasta cooking liquid. Return pasta to pot.
Add mushroom sauce to pasta and toss to coat, moistening with reserved pasta cooking liquid, if necessary.

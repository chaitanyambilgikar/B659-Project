In a bowl stir together the flour, 1/4 cup of the cornmeal, the baking powder, the sugar, and the salt, add the butter, and blend the mixture until it resembles coarse meal. Add the half-and-half and stir the mixture until it just forms a sticky dough. Gather the dough into a ball, knead it gently 6 times on a lightly floured surface, and roll or pat it out 1/2 inch thick. Cut out 6 rounds with a 2 1/2-inch cutter dipped in flour and transfer them to an ungreased baking sheet. Sprinkle the remaining 1 teaspoon cornmeal over the tops of the rounds and bake the biscuits in the middle of a preheated 450°F. oven for 12 to 14 minutes, or until they are golden.

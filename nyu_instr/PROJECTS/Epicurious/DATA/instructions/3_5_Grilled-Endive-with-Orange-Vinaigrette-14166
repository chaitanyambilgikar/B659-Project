Prepare grill.
With a vegetable peeler remove two 1 1/4- by 1/2-inch strips zest from orange and cut lengthwise into very thin strips. Squeeze enough juice from orange to measure 1 tablespoon. In a bowl whisk together zest, orange juice, vinegar, 1 tablespoon oil, and salt and pepper to taste until combined well.
Halve endives lengthwise, keeping halves from separating into leaves, and brush all over with remaining 2 teaspoons oil. Season endives with salt and pepper and grill, cut sides down, on a rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals 6 minutes. Turn endives and grill until just tender, 6 minutes more. (Alternatively, endives may be grilled in a hot well-seasoned ridged grill pan over moderately high heat.)
Serve endives drizzled with vinaigrette.

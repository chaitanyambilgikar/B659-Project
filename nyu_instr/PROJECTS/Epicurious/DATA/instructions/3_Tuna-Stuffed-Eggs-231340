1. Place the eggs in a medium saucepan with cold water to cover. Cover the pan and bring the water to a simmer. Cook 12 minutes. Drain and cool the eggs under running water.
2. Peel the eggs in half lengthwise and remove the yolks. In a medium bowl, mash the yolks with the butter. Stir in the tuna, cheese, and salt and pepper to taste.
3. Place the egg whites on a plate lined with lettuce leaves. Stuff the whites with the yolk mixture. Garnish with chopped parsley. Serve immediately.

Preheat broiler. Bring 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons water to boil in heavy medium saucepan. Stir in couscous and 1/2 teaspoon coarse salt. Remove from heat. Cover and let stand until water is absorbed and couscous is tender, about 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, stir tapenade, lemon juice, 1 teaspoon pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon coarse salt in small bowl to blend. Transfer 31/2 tablespoons tapenade mixture to another small bowl and reserve for couscous.
Thread fish pieces onto 4 metal skewers; arrange on broiler tray. Brush fish on both sides with remaining tapenade mixture. Broil fish until just opaque in center, about 4 minutes per side.
Fluff couscous with fork. Gently stir in reserved tapenade mixture. Stir in pico de gallo or serve it alongside. Mound couscous on plates. Top with fish skewers.

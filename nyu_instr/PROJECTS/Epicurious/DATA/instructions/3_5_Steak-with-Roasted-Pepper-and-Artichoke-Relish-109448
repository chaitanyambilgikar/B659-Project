Mince garlic and mash to a paste with a pinch of salt, then transfer to a bowl. Whisk in vinegar, mustard, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and sugar. Add 2 tablespoons oil in a slow stream, whisking until mixture is emulsified. Stir in roasted peppers, artichokes, and basil, then add salt and pepper to taste.
Pat steaks dry and sprinkle with remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Heat remaining tablespoon oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then sauté steaks, 2 at a time, turning over once, about 5 minutes per batch for medium-rare. Transfer steaks to plates as cooked. Serve steaks topped with relish.

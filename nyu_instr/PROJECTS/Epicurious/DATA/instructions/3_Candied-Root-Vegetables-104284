Melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add turnips, carrots and parsnips. Sauté vegetables 5 minutes, stirring often. Stir in Turkey Stock and sugar. Cover; bring to boil. Uncover; reduce heat to medium and simmer until vegetables are tender and liquid is reduced to syrup, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes. (Can be prepared 6 hours ahead; refrigerate. To rewarm, add 1/4 cup water and stir over medium heat until warmed through.) Season vegetables to taste with salt and pepper.

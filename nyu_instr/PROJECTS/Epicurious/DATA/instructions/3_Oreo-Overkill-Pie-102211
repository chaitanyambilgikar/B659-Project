Finely grind cookies in processor. Transfer 2 tablespoons cookie crumbs to small bowl; reserve. Add melted butter to remaining crumbs in processor; blend until moist crumbs form. Press crumb mixture onto bottom and up sides of 9-inch-diameter metal pie pan. Freeze crust until firm, about 10 minutes.
Spread half of ice cream in crust. Top with banana slices. Spread remaining ice cream over. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons cookie crumbs over pie. Freeze until firm, about 4 hours. (Can be made 3 days ahead. Cover; freeze.) Serve with sauce.

Melt butter in large pot over medium heat. Add onions and garlic. Cover; cook until onions are tender but not brown, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. Add flour; stir 2 minutes. Add broth, half and half, Sherry, thyme and bay leaf; bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer uncovered until garlic is very tender, about 15 minutes. Discard bay leaf. Working in batches, puree soup with bread in blender until smooth. Return to pot. Season with salt and pepper. Rewarm soup over medium heat; serve.

Cook bacon in a 10-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until browned, about 5 minutes. Spoon off all but 2 tablespoons fat from skillet (but leave bacon in skillet), then add onion and cook, stirring frequently, until beginning to soften, 3 to 4 minutes. Add peas, water, salt, pepper, and 1 tablespoon dill and cook, covered, stirring occasionally, until peas are tender, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir in butter and remaining tablespoon dill.

FOR BROWNIES: Preheat oven to 325 °F. Line 17 1/4x11 1/2x1-inch baking sheet with parchment. Bring sugar, butter and water to boil in heavy large saucepan over medium heat, stirring until sugar dissolves. Reduce heat to low. Add chocolate; stir until smooth. Whisk eggs and vanilla in large bowl to blend. Gradually whisk in hot chocolate mixture. Mix in flour, baking soda and salt, then nuts.
Spread butter over prepared sheet. Bake until toothpick inserted into center comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Cool completely. Freeze until firm.
Cut around brownie to loosen. Turn out onto work surface. Peel off parchment. Trim brownie to 16x10-inch rectangle; cut in half crosswise, making two 8x10-inch rectangles. Place 1 rectangle on baking sheet. Cover brownie with ice cream. Freeze until slightly firm.
Lightly score top of remaining brownie in half lengthwise, then score across, in 2-inch sections, making 10 2x4-inch rectangles.
Press scored brownie atop ice cream, scored side up. Freeze until ice cream is firm, at least 4 hours. Cut brownie along marked lines into 10 sandwiches. ( Can be made 2 weeks ahead. Wrap tightly; keep frozen.)
FOR SAUCE: Stir chocolate and coffee in saucepan over low heat until smooth. Add liquer. (Can be made 1 week ahead. Cover; chill. Rewarm before serving.)
Serve sandwiches with sauce.

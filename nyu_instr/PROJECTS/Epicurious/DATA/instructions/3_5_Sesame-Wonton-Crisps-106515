Preheat oven to 375°F.
Stir together oil and cornstarch in a small bowl until combined.
Stack wonton wrappers and halve diagonally. Arrange in 1 layer on a large baking sheet and brush tops with oil mixture. Sprinkle evenly with sesame seeds and kosher salt and bake in middle of oven until golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes. Transfer crisps as browned to a rack to cool.

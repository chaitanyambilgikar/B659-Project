Using rolling pin, lightly pound each chicken breast between sheets of waxed paper to 1/4- to 1/2-inch thickness. Add enough oil to heavy large saucepan to reach depth of 3 inches. Heat oil to 350°F. Working in batches, dip chicken into batter, turning to coat; fry chicken until golden brown and cooked through, about 3 minutes per side. Using tongs, transfer chicken to paper towels; drain. Cut chicken crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick slices.
Toss greens in large bowl with enough Citrus Dressing to coat. Divide greens among 8 plates. Top with chicken, dividing equally. Drizzle 1 tablespoon dressing over chicken on each plate.

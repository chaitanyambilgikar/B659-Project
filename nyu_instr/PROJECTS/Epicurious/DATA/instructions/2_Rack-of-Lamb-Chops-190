Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 375°F. Brush both sides of chops with 2 tablespoons mustard, divided evenly. Arrange chops on rack. Place rack with chops on baking sheet. Bake 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat olive oil in heavy medium skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and sauté until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Using back of fork, add remaining 2 tablespoons mustard, lemon juice and thyme and stir until blended. Add breadcrumbs and stir until crumb mixture begins to dry and crisp, approximately 5 minutes. Season crumb mixture with salt and pepper.
Remove chops from oven. Press half of crumb mixture firmly onto each chop. Bake until crumbs are brown and chops are cooked through and tender, approximately 20 minutes longer.

Dissolve the salt and sugar in the vinegar, add the sour cream and stir smooth. You may like more or less vinegar, salt or sugar, but don't make the dressing too sweet. Add the chives, dill and celery seed. Slice the unpared cucumbers paper-thin and combine with the dressing. Chill for 1 hour or more. Sour cream cucumbers improve in taste as they stand. The flavor of the cucumbers seeps into the dressing.

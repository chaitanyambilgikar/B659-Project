Blanch onions in large saucepan of boiling water 1 minute. Drain; cool briefly. Peel and trim, leaving core intact.
Heat oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions. Sprinkle with kosher salt and pepper; sauté until brown, 12 minutes. Add next 4 ingredients; bring to boil. Reduce heat. Cover; simmer 15 minutes. Increase heat; boil until onions are tender and liquid is thickened, stirring often, about 18 minutes. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.
Fold crème fraîche into onions (add cranberries, if using). Simmer until sauce coats onions thickly, 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to bowl; sprinkle with pomegranate seeds.

Preheat oven to 400°F. Butter 9 x 5 x 2 3/4-inch metal loaf pan. Whisk cornmeal and next 5 ingredients in medium bowl to blend. Stir in cheese. Whisk buttermilk, eggs and butter in another medium bowl to blend. Add egg mixture to dry ingredients and stir just until blended. Mix in chilies. Transfer batter to prepared pan.
Bake bread until deep golden brown on top and tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Cool in pan on rack 10 minutes. Turn bread out onto rack and cool completely. (Can be prepared 2 weeks ahead. Wrap in foil; freeze. Unwrap and thaw at room temperature.)

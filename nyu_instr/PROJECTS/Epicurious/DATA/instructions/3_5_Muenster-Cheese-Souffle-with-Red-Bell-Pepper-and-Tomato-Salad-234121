Bring milk just to simmer in small saucepan; remove from heat. Melt butter in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in flour; cook roux 2 minutes, whisking constantly (do not brown). Gradually whisk in warm milk. Cook until sauce is smooth and thick enough to drop from whisk in thin ribbon, whisking constantly, about 8 minutes. Remove from heat. Mix in cumin and season generously with salt and pepper; transfer to medium bowl. Cool 10 minutes. (Soufflé base can be made ahead. Press plastic wrap onto surface. Let stand 2 hours or chill 1 day. Bring to room temperature before using.)
Preheat oven to 400°F. Butter 4- to 5-cup soufflé dish; coat inside with panko. Whisk egg yolks into soufflé base 1 at a time; stir in cheese cubes. Beat egg whites and pinch of salt in another medium bowl until stiff but not dry.
Fold egg whites into soufflé base in 3 additions; transfer to prepared dish.
Bake soufflé until puffed, brown on top, and firm but jiggly to touch, about 28 minutes. Spoon soufflé onto 4 plates. Arrange salad alongside and serve.

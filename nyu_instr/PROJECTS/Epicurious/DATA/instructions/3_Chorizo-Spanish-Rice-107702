Heat oil in large deep skillet over medium-high heat. Add chorizo and sauté until golden, about 5 minutes. Add rice; stir to coat with oil. Add broth and water, then peas and onions; stir to mix. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; cover and simmer about 15 minutes. Stir in tomatoes with juices, olives, and marjoram. Cover and simmer until rice is tender and most of liquid is absorbed, about 5 minutes longer. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve.

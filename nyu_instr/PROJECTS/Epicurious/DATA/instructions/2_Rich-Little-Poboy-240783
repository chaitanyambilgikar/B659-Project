1. Preheat a grill or broiler; set the rack 3 inches from the heat source.
2. Grill or broil the skin side of the tomatoes until slightly charred (15 minutes on the grill, 8 minutes under the broiler). Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Set aside.
3. Halve the bread lengthwise and pull out some of the insides. Spread the mayonnaise on the bread. Arrange the roast beef evenly over the bottom half and lay the Brie diagonally over the meat. Top with the lettuce.
4. Place the tomatoes on the top half of the bread and mash them slightly with a fork. Invert the top over the bottom half of the sandwich, cut it in half crosswise and wrap well for the road.

In a large heavy saucepan combine the apples, 1/2 cup water, the lemon juice, and the sugar, bring the liquid to a boil, and simmer the mixture, stirring occasionally, for 25 minutes, or until the apples are very tender. Force the mixture through a food mill fitted with the fine disk into a bowl.
Serve the applesauce warm or chilled.

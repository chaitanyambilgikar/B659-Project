Make crust: Preheat oven to 375°F. Blend whole unblanched almonds, sugar and almond extract in processor until almonds are coarsely chopped. Add unsalted butter and process until almonds are finely chopped. Press almond mixture firmly onto bottom and 1 inch up sides of 8-inch-diameter springform pan with 2 1/2-inch-high sides. Bake crust until light brown, about 13 minutes. Transfer crust in pan to rack and cool. Reduce oven temperature to 300°F.
Make filling: Drain chestnuts thoroughly. Cut enough chestnuts into 1/4- to 1/2-inch pieces to measure 1 cup (reserve remaining chestnuts for topping). Using electric mixer, beat room temperature cream cheese, sugar and vanilla extract in medium bowl until very smooth. Beat in eggs, 1 at a time. Cover bottom of crust with 1 cup chestnuts pieces. Spoon cream cheese mixture over. Place springform pan on baking sheet.
Bake cheesecake on baking sheet until center is just set, about 45 minutes. Cool cheesecake 30 minutes. Chill uncovered until cold, about 3 hours, the cover. (Cheesecake can be made 1 day ahead. Keep refrigerated.)
Make topping: Cut around sides of pan to loosen cheesecake; release pan sides. Beat whipping cream in medium bowl until firm peaks form. Spoon cream into pastry bag fitted with medium star tip. Pipe rosettes of cream around to edge of cake. Place 1 reserved chestnut piece on each rosette.

In a large bowl toss the cucumbers with the salt and in a colander let them drain, covered with a plate and weighted with a 1-pound can, for 30 minutes. In the bowl toss the cucumbers with the lime juice, the chili, and salt to taste. The salad may be prepared 4 hours in advance and kept covered and chilled. Serve the salad chilled or at room temperature.

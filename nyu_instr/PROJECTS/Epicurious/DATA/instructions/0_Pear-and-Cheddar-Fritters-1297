Cut 3 thin vertical slices from opposite sides of each pear; discard cores. Alternating pear and cheese slices, place 2 cheese slices between 3 pear slices for each of 8 fritters. Holding each cheese-pear sandwich firmly together, coat lightly with flour, then eggs, then breadcrumbs, coating completely and pressing crumbs to adhere.
Pour oil into heavy large skillet to depth of 1 inch and heat to 350°F. Cook fritters in batches until golden, turning with slotted spoon, about 2 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels.

Heat oil in large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; sauté 3 minutes. Add tomatoes with any juices; simmer until slightly thickened, about 10 minutes. Stir in 1/3 cup basil. Season with salt and pepper.
Stir ricotta cheese in small saucepan over medium-low heat until just heated through. Add mozzarella cheese; stir just until melted, about 1 minute. Season to taste with pepper.
Spoon 1/4 cup tomato sauce into bottom of each of 4 shallow bowls. Place 2 hot lasagna noodle halves side by side atop sauce in each bowl. Top with 1/4 of cheese mixture, then with 2 more noodle halves. Divide remaining sauce among bowls. Sprinkle with Parmesan and remaining 2 tablespoons basil; serve.

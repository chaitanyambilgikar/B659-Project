Peel potatoes and cut into 1/2-inch cubes. Cover by 1 inch with cold water in a 2-quart heavy saucepan and simmer, uncovered, until just tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain, then transfer to a medium bowl and toss with vinegar and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Cool potatoes to warm.
Blanch sugar snaps and carrot with 1 teaspoon salt in a 1 1/2- to 2-quart saucepan of boiling water 1 minute. Drain vegetables in a sieve and rinse under cold running water, then pat dry. Cut sugar snaps diagonally into 1/3-inch pieces. Add carrot, sugar snaps, radishes, and celery to potatoes in bowl.
Pulse dressing, sour cream, herbs, pepper, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt in a blender until herbs are finely chopped. Add to potato mixture and stir to coat.

Make brownies: Preheat oven to 350°F. Line bottom and sides of a 9-inch square baking pan with wax paper or greased foil.
Melt chocolate and margarine in a metal bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water, stirring until smooth. Remove from heat and cool 5 minutes.
Beat eggs, sugar, and salt in a large bowl with an electric mixer on high speed until pale and thick. Beat in chocolate in 3 batches on low speed. Stir in zest, matzo meal, and nuts just until blended.
Spread batter in baking pan and bake in middle of oven until firm and a tester comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool in pan on rack, then invert onto a platter and remove paper or foil.
Make glaze: Whisk together sugar, cocoa, and wine in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil, whisking, then simmer 2 minutes, whisking occasionally. Add chocolate and whisk until melted. Remove from heat and whisk in margarine until smooth. Chill glaze, stirring occasionally, until spreadable.
Spread glaze over brownies and arrange walnut halves on top. Cut into 16 squares with a large knife, wiping it off with a damp cloth between cuts.

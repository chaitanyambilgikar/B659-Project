Cook couscous (or quinoa) according to package directions. Stir in cumin and parsley and salt to taste. Let cool to room temperature. To toast walnuts, heat a dry pan over medium heat. Add walnuts and shake or stir 6 or 7 minutes, until lightly browned. In a bowl, toss chicken, grapes, juices, basil, and curry and salt and pepper to taste. Arrange arugula on 4 plates and divide couscous among them. Top with chicken mixture and drizzle remaining liquid over salads. Sprinkle salads with walnuts.

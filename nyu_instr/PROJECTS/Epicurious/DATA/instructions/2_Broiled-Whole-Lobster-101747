Lobster is usually split before broiling, but it is my belief that this results in dry lobster meat, tasteless and tough. Broil the lobster whole over coals, allowing about 15 to 20 minutes cooking time. Turn it to cook evenly. Split it after broiling, remove the intestines and stomach and serve with plenty of melted butter and lemon quarters.

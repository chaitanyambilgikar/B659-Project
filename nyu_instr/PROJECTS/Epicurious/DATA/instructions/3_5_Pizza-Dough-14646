In a measuring cup stir together water and yeast until yeast is dissolved. In a large bowl whisk together flour and salt and add yeast mixture, stirring until a soft dough forms. On a lightly floured surface knead dough until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes.
Oil a large bowl (preferably with olive oil) and transfer dough to bowl, turning to coat. Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Let dough rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours.
On a lightly floured surface flatten dough with your hands. Cut dough in half and form into 2 balls. (Dough may be made 1 day ahead to this point. Wrap balls loosely in plastic wrap and chill in a small sealable plastic bag. Return dough to room temperature before proceeding.) Dust tops of balls with flour and cover each ball with an inverted bowl large enough to allow dough to expand. Let dough rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.

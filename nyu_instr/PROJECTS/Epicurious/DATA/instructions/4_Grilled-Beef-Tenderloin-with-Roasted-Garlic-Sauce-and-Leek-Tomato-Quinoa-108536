For sauce: Preheat oven to 350°F. Combine milk and garlic in small saucepan. Simmer, uncovered, over medium heat 10 minutes. Drain; discard milk. Place garlic heads, cut side up, in small ovenproof dish. Pour 1/2 cup oil over. Cover dish tightly with foil. Bake until garlic is soft, about 55 minutes. Remove garlic from oil; cool. Pour oil from dish into measuring cup; add more oil if necessary to measure 1/2 cup total. Squeeze out garlic from peel into blender. Add 1/2 cup broth and garlic oil; puree until smooth, thinning with more broth if desired. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover; chill. Rewarm over medium-low heat and thin with more broth, if desired, before serving.)
For beef: Prepare barbecue (medium heat). Rub beef all over with oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill beef to desired doneness, turning often, about 22 minutes for medium-rare. Remove from grill and let stand 5 minutes. Cut beef crosswise into 1/3-inch-thick slices.
Spoon Leek-Tomato Quinoa onto 4 plates. Top with beef, sauce, and chives.

Mince capers and garlic and mash with salt. In a bowl stir together garlic-caper paste with remaining ingredients and salt and pepper to taste. Chill mustard butter 10 minutes. Using wax paper as an aid, shape mustard butter into a 6-inch log and wrap. Chill butter until firm, at least 1 hour, and up to 3 days. Butter may be frozen, wrapped well in plastic wrap, 1 month.
Slice mustard butter as needed.

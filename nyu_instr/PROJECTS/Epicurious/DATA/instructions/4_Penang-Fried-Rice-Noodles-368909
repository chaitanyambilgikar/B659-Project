Soak noodles in cold water to cover 30 minutes, then drain. Cook noodles in a large (5- to 6-quart) pot of boiling salted water 4 minutes. Drain noodles in a colander, then rinse thoroughly and drain well.
Stir together soy sauce and water, then reserve.
Heat 1 1/2 teaspoons oil in wok or skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering, then add eggs and stir-fry until just cooked through, about 30 seconds. Transfer to a plate and wipe out pan, if necessary.
Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in pan until shimmering and stir-fry shrimp and chile paste 30 seconds (shrimp will not be cooked through).
Add chorizo and garlic and stir-fry until shrimp are just cooked through, 30 seconds to 1 minute.
Add soy mixture, cooked noodles, jicama, and scallions, and stir-fry until noodles are heated through and scallion greens are wilted, about 1 minute.
Remove pan from heat and stir in eggs. Serve immediately.

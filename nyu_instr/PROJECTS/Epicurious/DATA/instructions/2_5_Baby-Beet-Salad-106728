Scrub the beets well. Wrap groups of 2 or 3 beets together in little packets of aluminum foil. Place the packets on a baking sheet and bake at 350°F until very tender, about 1 hour. When the beets are cool enough to handle, slip off and discard the skins (using rubber gloves). Halve beets lengthwise and place in a bowl. Whisk together the oil, vinegar, salt and pepper; toss with the beets. Sprinkle with the mint leaves.

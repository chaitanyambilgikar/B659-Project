Make pies: Line six 3/4-cup custard cups or ramekins with double layer of plastic wrap, leaving 3-inch overhang. Spoon 2 tablespoons toasted coconut into bottom of each cup. Divide coconut ice cream among custard cups (about scant 1/3 cup each); spread evenly and press to compact. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon coconut over ice cream in each cup. Spread mango sorbet evenly over, dividing equally. Cover with plastic wrap overhang. Freeze until firm, at least 4 hours.
Make sauce: Puree blackberries with juices in processor. Strain puree into medium bowl, pressing on solids to extract as much fruit and liquid as possible. Discard solids in strainer. Stir sugar and liqueur into blackberry puree. (Pies and sauce can be made 3 days ahead. Keep pies frozen. Cover and chill sauce.)
Using plastic wrap overhang as aid, pull out pies from custard cups and invert pies onto plates. Peel off plastic. Spoon blackberry sauce around each pie; serve.

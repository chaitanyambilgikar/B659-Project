Preheat oven to 250°F. Lightly oil a large sheet of foil on a baking sheet and keep warm in oven.
Cook sugar, water, and a pinch of salt in a deep 2-quart heavy saucepan over moderately low heat, stirring slowly with a metal fork, until melted and pale golden. Cook caramel without stirring, swirling pan, until deep golden. Immediately stir in pumpkin seeds and quickly pour onto foil, spreading into a thin sheet before it hardens. (If caramel hardens and is difficult to spread, put in a 400°F oven until warm enough to spread, 1 to 2 minutes.)
Cool praline on baking sheet on a rack until completely hardened, then break into large pieces.

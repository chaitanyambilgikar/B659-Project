Heat olive oil in heavy large pot over medium heat. Add onions and garlic and sauté until onions are golden and tender, about 8 minutes. Add black-eyed peas, chicken broth, tomato sauce, oregano and cayenne pepper and bring to simmer. Simmer 15 minutes to blend flavors. Mix in vinegar. Season to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared up to 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Bring to simmer before serving.)
Ladle soup into bowls. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and serve.

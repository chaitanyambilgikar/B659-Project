Finely chop scallions and mince garlic. Pick over crab meat to remove any bits of shell and cartilage. In a bowl stir together cream cheese and sour cream until smooth and stir in all ingredients except crab until combined well. Stir in crab until just combined. Chill crab spread, covered, at least 8 hours and up to 1 day to develop flavors.
Serve crab spread with benne-seed wafers or other crackers.

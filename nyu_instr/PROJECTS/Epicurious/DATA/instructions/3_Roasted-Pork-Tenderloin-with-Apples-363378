Preheat the oven to 400°F. Pat the pork dry with a paper towel. Season with salt and pepper and sprinkle with the thyme.
Warm the oil in a large ovenproof skillet over medium- high heat. Sear the pork until browned on all sides, about 8 minutes. In the last 2 minutes of cooking, add the apples, cut side down.
Turn the apples over and transfer the skillet to the oven. Roast for 12 minutes, until the internal temperature of the pork reaches 145°F for medium.
Meanwhile, cook the barley according to the package directions. Keep warm.
Transfer the pork to a cutting board; tent with aluminum foil to keep warm. Remove the apples to a serving platter.
Place the skillet over medium- high heat. Add the wine; cook for 3 minutes, until the wine is reduced by half.
Slice the meat and transfer to the platter with the apples; add cooked barley. Drizzle the pan sauce over the pork and barley; serve.

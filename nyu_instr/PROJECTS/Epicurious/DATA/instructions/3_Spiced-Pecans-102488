Preheat oven to 350°F. Melt butter in medium skillet over medium heat. Add chili powder, salt and pepper and stir to blend. Remove from heat. Add pecans and stir to coat. Transfer to rimmed baking sheet. Bake until pecans are golden, about 8 minutes. Cool. Coarsely chop pecans. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.)

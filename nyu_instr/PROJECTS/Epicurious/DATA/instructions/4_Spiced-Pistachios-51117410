Preheat oven to 350°F. Whisk 5 large egg whites, 1/2 cup sugar, 1 teaspoon thyme leaves, 1/2 teaspoon ground allspice, 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger, 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, and 4 dashes of Angostura bitters in a medium bowl to blend. Fold in 1 pound unsalted, shelled raw natural pistachios. Spread out on a rimmed baking sheet brushed with vegetable oil. Bake, stirring every 10 minutes, until golden brown and beginning to crisp, 30-35 minutes. Let cool on sheet on a wire rack (nuts will crisp as they cool).

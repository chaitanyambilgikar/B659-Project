Whisk chickpea flour, salt and pepper in large bowl to blend. Whisk 1 3/4 cups water and 1/4 cup olive oil in medium bowl. Add water mixture to dry ingredients; whisk until batter is smooth. Cover; let stand at room temperature 1 hour.
Preheat broiler. Thoroughly coat 12-inch-diameter ovenproof skillet with 1 tablespoon olive oil. Pour half of batter into skillet, tilting skillet to spread evenly. Broil until golden brown, about 4 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 450°F. Transfer skillet to oven and bake farinata until knife inserted into center comes out clean, about 3 minutes. Cool. Run spatula around sides of skillet to loosen farinata, then slide out onto cutting board. Repeat with second half of batter. Cut each farinata into 6 wedges.

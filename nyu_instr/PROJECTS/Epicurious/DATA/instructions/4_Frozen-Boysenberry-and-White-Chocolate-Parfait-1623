For Parfait: Line 9x5-inch loaf pan with plastic wrap. Puree berries and 1/4 cup sugar in blender until just smooth. Strain. Measure 1 1/3 cups puree and place in heavy small saucepan. (Reserve any remaining puree for sauce.) Simmer 1 1/3 cups puree over medium heat until reduced to scant 1 cup, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes. Transfer to bowl and chill 30 minutes. Stir in cassis and lemon juice. Refrigerate reduced puree until ready to use.
Combine 3/4 cup sugar, water and yolks in medium metal bowl. Set bowl over saucepan of simmering water. Using hand-held electric mixer, beat yolk mixture until it registers 140°F on candy thermometer, occasionally scraping down sides of bowl, about 5 minutes. Continue cooking 3 minutes, beating constantly. Remove from over water. Add warm melted chocolate and vanilla extract and beat until cool. Beat whipping cream in another large bowl to stiff peaks. Gently mix 1/4 of whipped cream into chocolate mixture. Fold in remaining whipped cream.
Transfer 1 1/3 cups chocolate mixture to medium bowl. Fold in reduced berry puree. Fill prepared loaf pa n with 1/3 of remaining chocolate mixture. Cover with berry-chocolate mixture. Top with remaining chocolate mixture. Smooth top. Freeze parfait overnight. (Can be prepared 2 days ahead.)
For Sauce: Puree frozen boysenberries, sugar and crème de cassis in blender or processor until smooth. Strain. Add any berry puree reserved from parfait.
Unmold frozen parfait. Peel off plastic wrap. Slice into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Drizzle with sauce. Garnish with berries and fresh mint sprigs.

Cook onions and pepper in oil in a 12-inch heavy nonstick skillet over medium heat, covered, 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, peel potatoes and cut into 3/4-inch pieces.
Add potatoes to skillet and cook, partially covered, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are almost tender and vegetables begin to brown, 20 to 25 minutes.
Add wine and briskly simmer, uncovered, 2 minutes.
Add chorizo and clams and cook, covered, shaking skillet occasionally, until clams open wide, 6 to 10 minutes (discard any clams that remain unopened after 10 minutes). Divide among bowls and sprinkle with parsley.

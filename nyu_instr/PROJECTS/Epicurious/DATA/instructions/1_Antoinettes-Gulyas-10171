In a 5- to 6-quart kettle cook onions in 2 tablespoons butter over moderate heat, stirring, until pale golden and transfer to a bowl. In another bowl toss beef with flout until coated evenly. In kettle heat remaining 2 tablespoons butter over moderately high heat until foam subsides and cook beef, stirring occasionally, until no longer pink. Stir in onions, paprika, caraway seeds, marjoram, vinegar, broth, and salt and pepper to taste and simmer, covered, 45 minutes. Peel potatoes and cut into 1/2-inch cubes. Add potatoes to soup and simmer, covered, 20 minutes more, or until potatoes are tender.

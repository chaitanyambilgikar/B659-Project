Heat olive oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat until hot but not smoking, then cook sausages, turning over once, until well browned, about 8 minutes total. Add grapes and cook, stirring occasionally, until sausages are cooked through and grapes are softened, 10 to 12 minutes. Stir in vinegar and salt and pepper to taste.

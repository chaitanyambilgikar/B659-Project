Make crust: Blend flour, sugar and salt in processor. Add butter. Using on/off turns, process until mixture resembles very coarse meal. Beat egg with 2 tablespoons milk; add to processor. Blend until moist clumps form, adding more milk by tablespoonfuls if dough is dry. Gather dough into ball; divide into 2 pieces, 1 slightly larger than the other. Flatten each piece into disk and wrap in plastic; refrigerate 1 hour. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Keep refrigerated. Let soften slightly at room temperature before rolling out.)
Make filling: Combine first 6 ingredients in large bowl; toss to blend. Let stand until tapioca is translucent, tossing occasionally, about 35 minutes.
Preheat oven to 400°F. Roll out larger dough disk on floured surface to 13-inch round; transfer to 9-inch-diameter deep-dish glass pie dish with 1 3/4-inch-high sides. Spoon in filling; dot with butter. Roll out remaining dough disk to 7 x 11-inch rectangle. Cut lengthwise into 10 generous 1/2-inch-wide strips (reserve remaining dough for another use). Arrange 5 strips across pie. Form lattice by arranging 5 strips diagonally across first strips. Cut overhang of bottom crust and strips to 3/4 inch. Fold under; crimp edge decoratively. Sprinkle lattice with sugar.
Place pie on baking sheet; bake 30 minutes. Cover edge with foil. Continue to bake until filling bubbles thickly, about 50 minutes longer. Cool at least 45 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.

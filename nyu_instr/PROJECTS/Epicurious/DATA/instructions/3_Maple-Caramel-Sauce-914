Combine cream, sugar and syrup in heavy medium saucepan. Stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer sauce until caramel colored and reduced to 1 3/4 cups, whisking occasionally, about 35 minutes. Mix in maple flavoring. Cool slightly. (Can be made 3 days ahead. Cover and chill. Rewarm over medium heat, stirring; add 2 tablespoons hot water if necessary to dissolve any crystallized sugar.)

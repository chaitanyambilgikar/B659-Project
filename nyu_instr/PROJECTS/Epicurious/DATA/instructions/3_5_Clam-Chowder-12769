In a heavy saucepan cook the bacon, the onion, and the celery in the butter over moderately low heat, stirring, until the celery is softened, add the milk, the clams with the liquor, and the potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces, and simmer the chowder, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes, or until the potatoes are very tender. Stir in the scallion greens and salt and pepper to taste.

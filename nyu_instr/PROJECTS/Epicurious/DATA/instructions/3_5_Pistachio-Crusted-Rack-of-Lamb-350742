Transfer mixture to mini processor. Add butter, cinnamon, and cumin and blend until coarse puree forms. Place processor bowl in freezer 10 minutes to firm butter slightly.

Roast rack of lamb until instant-read thermometer inserted into side registers 135°F for medium-rare, about 30 minutes. Transfer to work surface and let rest 10 minutes. Cut lamb between bones. Drizzle with any juices from foil.

1. Wash the arugula and radicchio well in cold water; drain and pat dry.
2. Shred the radicchio leaves. Halve the endives lengthwise and sliver thinly. Place the arugula, radicchio, endives, radishes and chives in a large salad bowl.
3. Prepare the dressing: In a separate bowl, whisk together the vinegar, mustard, salt and pepper. Whisking constantly, slowly drizzle in the olive oil and continue whisking until combined.
4. Before serving, season the salad with salt and pepper. Drizzle lightly with the dressing and toss well.

Mix flour, salt, and pepper in a bowl and coat each piece of beef with it. Heat olive oil or butter in a heavy pot or Dutch oven and brown the meat over moderate heat. Remove meat as necessary to brown remaining meat. Return all meat to the pot. Dissolve beef stock cube in 2 cups boiling water and add to pot with meat. Add bay leaf and garlic and bring to a boil. Lower heat, cover, and simmer slowly until the meat is tender. Add onions, carrots, and potatoes; stir to mix ingredients, and cook for 10 minutes. Add peas, and continue simmering until the meat and vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes.

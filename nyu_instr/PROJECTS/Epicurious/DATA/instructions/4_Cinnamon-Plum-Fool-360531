Puree 2 1/4 cups plums and 3 tablespoons sugar in processor until smooth, 1 to 2 minutes (bits of plum skin will remain). Strain fruit into medium bowl, pressing on solids to extract puree; discard solids. Combine remaining diced plums, 3/4 cup puree, and cinnamon in large bowl; toss thoroughly to coat. Set aside remaining plum puree.
Beat cream, remaining 7 tablespoons sugar, and vanilla in another large bowl until stiff peaks form. Fold whipped cream into diced plum mixture.
Spoon some plum puree into eight 1-cup goblets. Top each with some plum-cream mixture. Drizzle each lightly with more plum puree; top with remaining plum-cream mixture and any remaining plum puree.

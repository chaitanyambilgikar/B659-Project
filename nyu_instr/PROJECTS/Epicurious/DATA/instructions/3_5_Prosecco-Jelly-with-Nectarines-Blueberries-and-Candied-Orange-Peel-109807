For jelly: Pour Prosecco into large bowl. Pour 3/4 cup cold water into small saucepan; sprinkle gelatin over and let stand until gelatin softens, about 5 minutes. Add sugar to gelatin mixture and stir over medium-low heat just until sugar and gelatin dissolve, about 5 minutes (do not boil). Whisk gelatin mixture into Prosecco (mixture will foam; let stand to settle). Cover and refrigerate at least 3 hours. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Keep refrigerated.)
For candied orange peel: Using vegetable peeler and working from top of orange toward bottom, remove peel (orange part only) from oranges in long strips. Cut orange peel lengthwise into 1/8-inch-wide strips.
Bring 2 cups water to boil in small saucepan. Add pinch of salt and orange peel; reduce heat to medium and simmer 15 minutes. Drain. Return peel to same pan. Add remaining 3/4 cup water, sugar, and Grand Marnier. Bring to boil; reduce heat to medium and simmer until thick syrup forms and mixture is reduced to 1/2 cup, about 20 minutes. Cool peel completely in syrup. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and keep refrigerated. Bring to room temperature before continuing.)
For fruit: Toss all ingredients in large bowl to blend. Let stand until sugar dissolves, about 5 minutes.
Using spoon, scoop Prosecco jelly into bite-size pieces. Divide among 8 serving bowls or goblets. Spoon fruit over jelly. Scatter 1 teaspoon candied orange peel over each serving.

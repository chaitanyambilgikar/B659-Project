1. Preheat oven to 375°F.
2. To prepare the crust, sift the flour and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt into a medium mixing bowl. Slowly pour in 1/3 cup of the oil while stirring to form a dough. Do not overmix or the dough will be too tough. Use up to 2 tablespoons of water to help form the dough.
3. Gather the dough into a ball and lightly roll with a rolling pin until it reaches a 9-inch diameter. Press the rolled dough into a 9-inch pie plate. Poke the bottom of the crust all over with a fork. Set aside while preparing the filling.
4. Heat a medium skillet over medium heat and add the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil and the onion. Sauté for 2 minutes, add the cabbage and zucchini, and sauté an additional 5 minutes. Add the spinach and sauté until wilted.
5. Add the garlic, the remaining 1/2 teaspoon of salt, marjoram, basil, thyme, mustard, paprika, and pepper. Stir well to combine, and sauté for 1 minute.
6. Pour the mixture into the prepared crust.
7. Bake for 35 minutes.
8. Remove pie from the oven and garnish with a ring of tomato slices.

Combine first 5 ingredients in large bowl. Remove any visible fat and excess skin from chicken. Add chicken to bowl with marinade; toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate 4 hours or overnight, stirring occasionally.
Preheat oven to 400°F. Place wire rack atop baking sheet. Remove chicken from marinade, reserving marinade. Place chicken skin side up on rack. Bake chicken 20 minutes. Turn chicken and bake 20 minutes longer. Turn chicken skin side up and continue cooking until skin is golden brown and chicken is almost cooked through, approximately 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, boil marinade in heavy small saucepan until reduced to glaze, about 10 minutes. Brush chicken with glaze. Bake chicken until glaze is just set and chicken is cooked through, approximately 5 minutes. Serve.

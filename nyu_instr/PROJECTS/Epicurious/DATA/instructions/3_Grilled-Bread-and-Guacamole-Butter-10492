Cut bread diagonally into 1/4-inch-thick slices and brush both sides of each slice with oil.
Prepare grill (or preheat oven).
Grill bread in batches on a rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals, turning it, until toasted on both sides, about 3 minutes. (Alternatively, bread may be toasted in batches on a baking sheet in a 350°F. oven until crisp, 10 to 12 minutes.) Grilled bread may be made 1 week ahead and cooled completely before keeping in an airtight container at room temperature.
Halve avocados and discard pits. Spoon flesh into a food processor. Add remaining ingredients and blend just until smooth. Guacamole "butter" may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, its surface covered with plastic wrap.
Serve bread topped with dollops of guacamole "butter."

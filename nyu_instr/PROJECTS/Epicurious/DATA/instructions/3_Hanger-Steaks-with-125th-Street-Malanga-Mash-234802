Sprinkle steaks with adobo seasoning. Place in single layer in 13x9x2-inch glass baking dish. Mix orange juice, lemon juice, and vinegar in bowl; pour over steaks. Let marinate at room temperature 1 hour.
Heat 2 tablespoons oil in each of 2 heavy large skillets over medium-high heat. Remove steaks from marinade; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Add 2 steaks to each skillet and cook to desired doneness, about 6 minutes per side for medium-rare. Serve with malanga mash.

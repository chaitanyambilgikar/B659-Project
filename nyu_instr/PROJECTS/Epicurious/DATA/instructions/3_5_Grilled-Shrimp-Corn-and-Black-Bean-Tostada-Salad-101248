Make Dressing: Place lime juice in medium bowl. Gradually whisk in olive oil. Mix in cilantro, jalepeño, and cumin. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Make Salad: Combine tomatoes, beans, green onions, 3/4 cup cilantro and red onion in large bowl. (Dressing and salad can be prepared 6 hours ahead. Cover dressing and let stand at room temperature. Cover salad and refrigerate.)
Prepare berbeque (medium-high heat). Mix lettuce into salad. Pour 1/4 cup dressing into small bowl. Reserve remainder for salad. Brush corn with dressing from small bowl. Grill corn unril beginning to brown, turning often, about 5 minutes. Brush shrimp with dressing from small bowl and grill until opaque in center, turning occasionally, about 5 minutes.
Cut kernels from corn and add to salad. Toss salad with enough dressing to coat. Season with salt and pepper. Top with shrimp. Garnish with tortilla chips and additional cilantro, if desired.

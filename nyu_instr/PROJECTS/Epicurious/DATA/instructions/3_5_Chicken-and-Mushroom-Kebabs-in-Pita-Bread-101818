Whisk first 6 ingredients in bowl to blend. Pour half of marinade into another bowl. Add mushrooms to first bowl; add chicken to second bowl. Toss to coat; let stand 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Wrap 1 bacon piece around each chicken piece. Alternate 4 mushrooms and 3 chicken pieces on each skewer, piercing bacon to secure. Discard chicken marinade. Reserve mushroom marinade. Grill kebabs until chicken is cooked through, turning skewers and basting with reserved mushroom marinade, about 25 minutes. Grill pita breads in foil at edge of barbecue until warm.
Unwrap pita breads. Place 1 kebab in center of each bread. Fold bread sides up around each kebab and pull out skewer.

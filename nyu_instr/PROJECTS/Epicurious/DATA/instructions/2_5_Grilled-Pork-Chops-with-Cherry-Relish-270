Season pork lightly with pepper. Place in shallow baking dish. Pour soy sauce over. Turn chops to coat. Cover; chill 1 hour, turning occasionally.
Heat oil in small skillet over medium heat. Add onion, ginger and garlic; sauté until onion is almost tender, about 5 minutes. Add cherries; sauté until cherries begin to soften, about 8 minutes. Remove from heat. Season with salt.
Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat) or preheat broiler. Remove pork from marinade. Grill pork until cooked through, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer to plates. Spoon relish over.

Whisk 1/4 cup oil, lemon juice, rosemary, and garlic in small bowl. Season dressing with salt and pepper. Place potatoes in medium bowl; add 2 tablespoons dressing. Place turkey in another medium bowl; add 2 tablespoons dressing. Let potatoes and turkey marinate at room temperature 15 to 30 minutes, turning occasionally.

Grill potatoes and turkey until charred and cooked through, 10 minutes per side for potatoes and 3 to 4 minutes per side for turkey. Divide turkey and potatoes among 4 plates. Drizzle with remaining dressing.

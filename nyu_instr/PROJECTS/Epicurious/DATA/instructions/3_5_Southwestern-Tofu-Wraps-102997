Whisk 3 tablespoons lime juice and oil in medium bowl. Add tofu, onion, cilantro and garlic and toss to blend. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Let marinate 20 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350°F. Wrap tortillas in foil. Place in oven until heated through, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, toss lettuce with 1 tablespoon lime juice in small bowl.
Place 1 tortilla on each of 4 plates. Place layer of lettuce down center of each tortilla. Top with tofu mixture, dividing equally. Spoon 1 1/2 tablespoons salsa over each. Roll up tortillas. Serve, passing remaining salsa separately.

1. Combine all the ingredients except the pears in a pot and bring to a simmer.
2. Carefully lower the pears into the liquid (adding up to 1 cup water to make sure the fruit is fully submerged).
3. Simmer until the pears are tender, 15 to 17 minutes for small pears, 25 to 30 minutes for large ones.
4. Cool the pears in the cooking liquid for 30 minutes before serving, or store them in the refrigerator (still in the liquid) for up to a week.

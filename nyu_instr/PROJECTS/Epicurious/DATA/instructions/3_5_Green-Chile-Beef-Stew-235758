Pat beef dry and season with pepper and 1 teaspoon salt.
Heat oil in a 10- to 11-inch-wide (5- to 7-quart) heavy pot over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then cook beef in 2 or 3 batches, turning occasionally, until browned, 6 to 8 minutes per batch. Transfer as browned to a bowl using a slotted spoon.
Add onion and garlic to fat in pot and cook over moderately high heat, stirring and scraping up brown bits, until softened, about 8 minutes. Add cumin and remaining teaspoon salt and cook, stirring, 2 minutes. Return beef (with any juices accumulated in bowl) to pot and stir in tomatoes with juice and enough water to cover meat, then bring to a simmer.
Discard seeds, ribs, and stems from chiles, then cut lengthwise into 1/3-inch-wide strips. Add chiles to stew and gently simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally to break up tomatoes, until meat is very tender, about 3 hours.

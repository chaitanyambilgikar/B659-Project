1. Preheat the oven to 350°. Place the roasting pan in the oven and pour 1/2 inch of hot water into it.
2. Scatter the raisins across the bottom of the glass baking dish. Cut the croissants into 1/2-inch-thick slices and place on top of the raisins in the dish.
3. Combine the milk, whole eggs, egg yolks, and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle. With the paring knife, split the vanilla bean in half lengthwise. Place one half in the plastic bag and reserve for another use. Scrape the seeds from the other half into the bowl. Discard the scraped bean half. Beat on medium-low speed with the mixer until well blended and a little frothy, 1 to 2 minutes.
4. Pour the egg mixture over the croissants and press the bread with the back of the spoon to make sure that everything is submerged. Let stand a minute or two, pressing with the spoon once or twice, to allow the bread to absorb the egg mixture. Carefully place the dish in the pan of hot water and bake until golden and just set, about 50 minutes.
5. Carefully remove the roasting pan from the oven, then remove the baking dish from the pan and let cool on the wire rack. Serve slightly warm or let cool completely, refrigerate covered with plastic wrap up to 24 hours, and serve chilled.

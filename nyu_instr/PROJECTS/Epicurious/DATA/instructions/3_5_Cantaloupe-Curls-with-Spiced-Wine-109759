Simmer all ingredients except cantaloupes in a 1-quart heavy saucepan until reduced to about 1/4 cup, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat and cool in saucepan set in a bowl of ice and cold water. Discard bay leaf.
Halve each cantaloupe and discard seeds. Scoop out curls from melon halves with an ice cream scoop (not one with a lever), then divide curls among 4 bowls along with any juices. Just before serving, drizzle each serving with about 1 tablespoon cooled spiced wine.

Place the water and the sugar in a small saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a boil, stirring all the while. When the sugar has dissolved, add the apricots, return to the boil, and reduce the heat so the liquid is simmering gently. Simmer the apricots just until they begin to turn tender, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and cool completely.
Puree the apricots and their poaching liquid in a food processor until smooth. Strain the mixture if you like, though it isn't necessary. Chill the mixture in an airtight container in the refrigerator for at least one hour and up to 24 hours.
Just before freezing, whisk in the lemon juice. Freeze according to the ice cream freezer manufacturer's instructions.

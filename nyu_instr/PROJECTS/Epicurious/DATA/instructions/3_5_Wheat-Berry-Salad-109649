Cook wheat berries in a 4-quart pot of boiling water (not salted), uncovered, until tender, 1 to 1 1/4 hours. Drain in a large sieve and rinse under cold water to cool, then drain well.
Whisk together vinegar, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Add oil in a slow stream, whisking until combined. Add wheat berries, onion, and dill and stir to coat well.

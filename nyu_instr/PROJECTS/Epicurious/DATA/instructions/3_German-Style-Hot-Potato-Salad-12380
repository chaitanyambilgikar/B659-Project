In a steamer set over boiling water steam the potatoes, covered, for 10 to 12 minutes, or until they are just tender, and transfer them to a bowl. While the potatoes are steaming, in a heavy skillet cook the kielbasa over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until it is golden, add the onion, and cook the mixture, stirring occasionally, until the onion is golden. Remove the skillet from the heat and add the vinegar and the broth carefully. Bring the mixture to a boil, scraping up the brown bits, and boil it until the liquid is reduced to about 2/3 cup. Add the kielbasa mixture to the potatoes with the parsley and combine the salad well.

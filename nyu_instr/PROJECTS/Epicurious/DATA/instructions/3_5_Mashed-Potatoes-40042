Peel the potatoes and cut them into quarters. Put them in a pan and just cover them with cold water. Bring them to a boil and boil gently for 15-20 minutes or until tender when pierced with a fork. Drain very well and return to very low heat. Add 1/2 cup hot milk and the butter and start mashing with a potato masher or a fork (or put them through a potato ricer), smoothing out all the lumps. When you have worked the potatoes free of the lumps, transfer to a warm bowl and whip with a fork or whisk until light and fluffy, adding the remaining milk, if necessary, and salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately, or keep hot, uncovered, in a double boiler.
Potato Cakes. Using leftover mashed potatoes, shape into small flat cakes. Dip lightly in flour, shake off any excess, and brown each side in hot bacon fat or butter over medium heat.

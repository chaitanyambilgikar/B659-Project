Preheat oven to 350°F. Arrange six 3/4-cup custard cups or ramekins in 13x9x2-inch baking pan. Combine cream, sugar, 2 tablespoons Marsala, and lemon peel in heavy medium saucepan. Stir over medium heat just until sugar dissolves (cream will be only lukewarm). Remove from heat. Whisk eggs and yolks in medium bowl until well blended. Whisk in cream mixture, then vanilla. Pour custard into cups, dividing equally. Pour enough hot water into baking pan to come halfway up sides of custard cups.
Bake flans until softly set in center, about 35 minutes. Remove flans from water bath and refrigerate uncovered until very cold and firm, at least 3 hours and up to 1 day.
Using knife, cut around flans in cups to loosen. Invert onto plates, shaking to dislodge if necessary. Stir caramel sauce in small saucepan over medium heat until warm, about 2 minutes. Whisk in remaining 3 tablespoons Marsala. Serve flans with caramel sauce.

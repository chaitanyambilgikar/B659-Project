Make dressing In blender, purée mango, yogurt, and vinegar until silky smooth, about 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in salt and pepper and set aside.
Make salad Have ready a large bowl of ice and cold water. In medium saucepan over high heat, bring salted water to a boil. Add asparagus and boil, uncovered, until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Drain, then immediately plunge spears into ice water to stop cooking. Drain again and pat dry.
In medium bowl, toss together spinach and arugula.
In small bowl, toss mango and chives with olive oil.
To plate, pour 1/4 cup mango dressing into center of each of 4 plates. Lay three asparagus spears side-by-side over each pool of dressing, then top each with 1/4 of salad greens. Sprinkle with mango-chive mixture, then top with prosciutto.

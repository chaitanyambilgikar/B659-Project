Preheat oven to 325°F. Combine sugar and water in heavy small saucepan. Stir over medium-low heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat and boil syrup without stirring until deep amber, brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush and swirling pan occasionally. Divide caramel among six 3/4-cup custard cups.
Finely grind chocolate and walnuts in processor. Transfer to large bowl. Combine sweetened condensed milk and milk in heavy small saucepan. Bring to boil. Pour over chocolate mixture. Stir until chocolate melts and mixture is smooth. Cool slightly. Whisk in egg.
Divide chocolate mixture among cups. Place cups in large baking pan. Add enough hot water to baking pan to come halfway up sides of cups. Bake until puddings are set, about 45 minutes. Remove from water. Chill until cold. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Keep refrigerated.)
Using small knife, cut around sides of puddings. Invert onto plates, allowing caramel syrup to run over sides.

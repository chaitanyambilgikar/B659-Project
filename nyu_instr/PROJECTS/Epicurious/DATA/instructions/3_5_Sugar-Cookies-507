Using electric mixer, beat butter, oil, 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup powdered sugar in large bowl until well blended. Mix in egg and vanilla. Sift flour, baking soda, cream of tartar and salt over and mix in. Cover mixture and chill until firm, about 30 minutes or up to 1 day.
Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter 2 heavy large baking sheets. Roll 1 tablespoon dough into ball. Place on prepared sheet. Repeat with remaining dough, spacing balls evenly on sheets. Dip flat-bottomed glass into water to moisten, then dip into sugar and press dough to 1/4-inch-thick round. Repeat with remaining dough balls, dipping bottom of glass into sugar before pressing each.

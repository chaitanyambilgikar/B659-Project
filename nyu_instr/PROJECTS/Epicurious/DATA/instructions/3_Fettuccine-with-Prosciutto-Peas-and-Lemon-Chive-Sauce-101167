Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite. Add peas; cook 30 seconds. Drain, reserving 1/2 cup pasta cooking water. Return pasta and peas to pot. Add cream, chives, lemon juice and lemon peel to pasta. Toss over medium heat to coat, adding reserved pasta water by tablespoonfuls if dry, about 1 minute. Mix in prosciutto; season with salt and pepper.

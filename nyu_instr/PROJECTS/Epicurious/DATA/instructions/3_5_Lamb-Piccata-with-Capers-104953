Using small sharp knife, cut around lamb bones; discard bones, leaving 3 irregular pieces of meat from each chop. Cut off fat and sinew from each piece. Place lamb between sheets of waxed paper or plastic wrap. Using meat mallet, pound lamb to 1/3-inch thickness. Sprinkle lamb generously with salt and pepper. Coat lamb with flour; shake off excess. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in large skillet over medium-high heat. Working in batches, add lamb to skillet and cook until brown and beginning to shrink, about 2 minutes per side, adding more butter to skillet as needed. Transfer lamb to platter; cover to keep warm. Add broth to skillet; boil until reduced to generous 1/3 cup, scraping up any browned bits, about 2 minutes. Add lemon juice. Reduce heat to medium-low; add 2 tablespoons butter 1/2 tablespoon at a time, whisking until melted before adding next piece. Stir in capers. Season with salt and pepper. Pour sauce over lamb and serve.

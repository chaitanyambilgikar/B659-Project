Place cherries in small bowl. Pour 3/4 cup boiling water over. Let stand until softened, about 30 minutes. Drain well. Pat cherries dry with paper towels. Mix cherries, nuts and jam in medium bowl.
Lightly oil heavy medium baking sheet. Stack phyllo sheets on work surface. Trim to 10-inch square (save scraps for another use). Cover stack with plastic and damp kitchen towel. Place 1 phyllo square on work surface. Brush lightly with butter. Arrange another phyllo square atop, with corners at a slight angle. Brush lightly with butter. Repeat with 2 more squares, arranging corners at slight angle. Spoon 1/4 cup sherry mixture in center of phyllo stack. Lift edges of phyllo and bring together around filling, forming bundle. With string, tie bundle just above filling. Place on prepared sheet. Repeat with remaining phyllo and filling, forming total of 6 bundles. Brush outside of filled portion (but not tops) of each bundle with butter. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover carefully and chill.)
Preheat oven to 325°F. Bake until phyllo is golden about 35 minutes. Transfer sheet to rack and cool. Carefully cut string from each bundle. Sift powdered sugar over bundles and serve.

In a 6-quart kettle bring 5 quarts water to a boil. Peel potato and cut into 1/2-inch dice. Add potato and salt to boiling water and boil 2 minutes. Add zucchini and pasta and boil until pasta is al dente.
Drain pasta and vegetables in a colander, reserving 1/2 cup cooking liquid, and in a bowl toss pasta and vegetables with oil, basil or parsley, reserved cooking liquid, and Parmesan. Season with additional salt and pepper.

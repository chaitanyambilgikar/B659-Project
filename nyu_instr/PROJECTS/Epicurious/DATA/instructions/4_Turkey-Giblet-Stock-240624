Pat neck and giblets dry. Heat oil in a heavy medium pot over medium-high heat until it shimmers, then brown neck and giblets, turning occasionally, about 5 minutes. Add vegetables and garlic and sauté until golden, about 5 minutes. Add wine and boil 1 minute. Add remaining ingredients, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and briskly simmer, uncovered, until reduced to 4 1/2 cups, 45 minutes to 1 hour. (If you have less, add water; if you have more, continue to reduce.) Strain through a large sieve into a large bowl, discarding solids. Skim off and discard fat.

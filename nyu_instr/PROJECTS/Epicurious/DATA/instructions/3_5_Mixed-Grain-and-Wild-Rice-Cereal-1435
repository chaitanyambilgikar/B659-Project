Simmer 2 cups water and wild rice in small saucepan 20 minutes. Drain.
Preheat oven to 375°F. Butter 2 1/2-quart ovenproof dish. In prepared dish, mix wild rice with remaining 6 cups water. Stir in all remaining ingredients. Cover loosely with foil and bake until grains are tender, water is absorbed and cereal is creamy, stirring occasionally, about 1 1/2 hours.

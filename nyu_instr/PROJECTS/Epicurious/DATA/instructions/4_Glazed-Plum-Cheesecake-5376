Make crust Preheat oven to 350°F. Lightly butter 9-inch-diameter springform pan with 2 3/4-inch-high sides. Combine graham crackers, brown sugar, cinnamon and salt in processor. Process until fine crumbs form. Mix in melted butter. Transfer to prepared pan. Pat crumb mixture over bottom (not sides) of pan. Bake crust until set and golden, about 10 minutes. Transfer to rack while preparing filling.
Make filling Reduce oven temperature to 300°F. Using electric mixer, beat cream cheese in large bowl until smooth. Beat in sugar. Beat in eggs just until blended. Mix in sour cream, lemon peel and vanilla.
Pour filling into crust-lined pan. Bake until sides of cheesecake puff slightly and center is just set, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Turn oven off. Leave cake in oven with door slightly open for 30 minutes.
Transfer cake to rack. Run small knife between crust and pan. Cool cake completely in pan on rack, about 3 hours (cake may crack slightly as it cools). Cover and refrigerate cake overnight.
Make plums Whisk orange juice, jelly, brown sugar and ginger in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat until jelly dissolves. Add plums. Bring mixture to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer gently until plums are just tender but still hold shape, about 3 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer plums to large plate and cool.
Boil cooking liquid until thickened to syrup consistency, about 7 minutes. (Plums and syrup can be prepared 4 hours ahead. Cover separately and refrigerate.)
Release pan sides from cheesecake. Arrange plums in concentric circles atop cheesecake, covering completely. Brush some syrup over plums. Cut cake into wedges. Serve with remaining syrup.

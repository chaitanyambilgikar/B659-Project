Preheat oven to 350° F. Finely grind flour, pecans, salt, pepper, thyme, and nutmeg in processor. Transfer flour mixture to shallow bowl. Heat 3 tablespoons oil in each of 2 heavy large ovenproof skillets over high heat. Dip chicken into beaten egg, then into flour mixture, coating completely. Add 3 pieces of chicken to each skillet and cook until golden, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer skillets to oven; bake until chicken is cooked through, about 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, melt butter in heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add shallots and sauté 2 minutes. Add brandy and bring to boil. Add Chicken Stock and boil until mixture is reduced to 1 cup, about 8 minutes. Season sauce with salt and pepper. Mix in parsley.
Place chicken on work surface. Cut diagonally into 1/2-inch-wide slices. Arrange on plates. Pour sauce around chicken. Serve with Parsnip Gnocchi.

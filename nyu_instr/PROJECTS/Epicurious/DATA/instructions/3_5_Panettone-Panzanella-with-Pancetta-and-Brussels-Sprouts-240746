For vinaigrette: Melt butter in heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add apple slices and sauté until golden brown, turning occasionally, about 6 minutes. Cover; cook until very tender, about 1 minute. Transfer apple slices and pan juices to blender and cool. Add oil, vinegar, and shallots. Blend until smooth. Add cider, 2 tablespoons at a time, blending to pourable consistency. Season vinaigrette with salt and pepper. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Bring to room temperature before using.
For croutons: Preheat oven to 400°F. Spray large rimmed baking sheet with nonstick spray. Place panettone in large bowl. Melt butter in small skillet over medium heat. Add garlic, sage, and thyme. Sauté until fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour butter mixture over panettone; toss to coat. Add cheese and sprinkle with salt and pepper; toss. Spread cubes on prepared sheet.
Bake croutons until pale golden, stirring occasionally, about 6 minutes. Cool on baking sheet up to 6 hours.
For salad: Place radicchio in large bowl of water and ice. Chill at least 1 hour and up to 3 hours.
Sauté pancetta in large skillet over medium heat until crisp; transfer to paper towels to drain. Cook brussels sprouts in large saucepan of boiling salted water until tender, about 7 minutes; drain. DO AHEAD: Can be prepared 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.
Combine croutons, pancetta, and brussels sprouts in large bowl. Drain radicchio very well and add to salad. Add enough vinaigrette to coat, tossing to blend well. Transfer salad to large shallow bowl. Sprinkle with pomegranate seeds, if desired.

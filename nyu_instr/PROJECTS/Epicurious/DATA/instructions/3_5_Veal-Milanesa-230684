Gently pound cutlets to 1/8-inch thickness between 2 sheets of plastic wrap with flat side of meat pounder or with rolling pin. Pat dry and season with salt and pepper.
Beat together eggs and garlic in large shallow bowl. Place breadcrumbs in another large shallow bowl. Dip veal, 1 piece at a time, in egg mixture, letting excess drip off. Dredge in bread crumbs, pressing to coat completely. Repeat with remaining pieces of veal.
Heat butter and 2 tablespoons oil in large heavy skillet over moderately high heat, until foam subsides. Sauté chops in 2 batches (without crowding) until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper-towel-lined platter and keep warm.
Toss arugula with vinegar in large bowl and season with salt and pepper. Add tomatoes and remaining 6 tablespoons oil and toss well. Serve chops with salad and mustard.

Finely chop parsley and garlic together and transfer to a small bowl, then stir in chives.
Open lamb like a book, fat side down, on a work surface and sprinkle with 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Spread herb mixture evenly over lamb, then fold lamb back into original shape and tie with string at 1-inch intervals. Pat lamb dry and transfer to a small roasting pan. Rub lamb with oil and sprinkle with remaining tablespoon salt and remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper.
Roast lamb until thermometer inserted diagonally 2 inches into lamb averages 135 to 140°F for medium-rare (test in several places, as different parts of leg cook at different speeds), 40 to 50 minutes. Transfer to a plate and let stand, loosely covered with foil, 30 minutes before slicing. Cut off and discard string and serve lamb warm or at room temperature.

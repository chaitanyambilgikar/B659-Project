Preheat oven to 350°F with rack in middle. Generously butter 9 muffin cups.
Whisk together oil, milk, egg plus yolk, and vanilla in a large bowl.
Whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in another bowl, then whisk into milk mixture until just combined. Stir in nuts, then fill buttered muffin cups half full with batter.
Bake until golden and a wooden pick comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool in pan on a rack 15 minutes.

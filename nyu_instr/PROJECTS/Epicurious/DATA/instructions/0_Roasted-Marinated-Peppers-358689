1. To blister the peppers, place over an open flame or directly on the coals. Turn to grill on all sides until the skin is completely blackened. Immediately transfer to a large resealable plastic bag or place in a large bowl and cover the top with plastic wrap to seal. Let sit for 30 minutes, or until cool enough to handle.
Working with one pepper at a time, transfer to a work surface. Remove the skin, stem, and seeds. It's OK if some bits of char remain, that will add great flavor.
Cut the peppers into 2-inch strips and toss with the garlic, shallots, fleur de sel, pepper, and vinegar. Let sit at room temperature for at least 1 hour, or up to 4 hours to allow the flavors to develop.
2. Toss with the olive oil and parsley just before serving.

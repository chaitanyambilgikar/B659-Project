In a bowl whisk together cornmeal, flour, baking soda, salt, and sugar. Coarsely chop corn and in another bowl stir together with egg, buttermilk, and chives. Stir in cornmeal mixture and let batter stand 15 minutes.
In a 10-inch non-stick skillet heat 1 teaspoon butter over moderate heat until foam subsides and drop batter by teaspoon measures into skillet, without crowding (about 10). Cook cakes until golden, about 1 minute on each side, transferring to paper towels to drain, and make more cakes in same manner.
Top warm corn cakes with sour cream and roe and garnish with onion.

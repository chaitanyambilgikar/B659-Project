Cover potatoes with salted cold water by 1 inch in a 4-quart saucepan and parboil gently, uncovered, 4 minutes. Drain well in a colander and let stand until dry, about 5 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350°F.
Heat 3 tablespoons clarified butter in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then sauté half of potatoes, shaking skillet and turning potatoes occasionally, until golden brown on all sides, 4 to 6 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Reduce heat to moderately low and cook potatoes, turning them, until tender, about 5 minutes more. Transfer to a baking sheet and sprinkle with parsley, then keep warm in oven. Sauté remaining potatoes in same manner.

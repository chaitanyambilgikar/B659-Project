Preheat oven to 450°F. Press out folds in crust. Press crust into 9-inch glass pie plate. Trim and crimp edges. Bake crust until light golden, about 9 minutes. Transfer to rack and cool. Reduce oven temperature to 350°F.
Melt butter in heavy medium saucepan over low heat. Add sugar and stir until mixture is heated through. Transfer to bowl. Add eggs, lemon juice and vanilla and whisk to combine. Stir in 1 1/2 cups coconut.
Pour filling into crust. Bake until filling is deep golden brown and set, about 40 minutes. Cool on rack. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Bring to room temperature before continuing.) Garnish with shredded coconut, if desired.

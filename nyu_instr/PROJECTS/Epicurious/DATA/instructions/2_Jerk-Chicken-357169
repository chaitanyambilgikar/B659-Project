Preheat the oven to 375°F.
Combine the allspice, cinnamon, nutmeg, onion, scallions, chile, rum, salt, and pepper in a food processor. Process until the mixture forms a thick salsa-like mixture.
Rub the mixture on each chicken breast and place the chicken in a zipper-lock plastic bag. Squeeze out the air and seal the bag. Refrigerate for 10 minutes.
Spray the rack of a roasting pan with non-stick spray and place in the pan.
Arrange the chicken on the rack, and bake for 12 minutes. Flip the chicken and cook another 15 minutes until cooked through. Serve warm.

Halve the eggs lengthwise, force the yolks through a sieve into a bowl, and stir in the minced tomatoes, the mayonnaise, the sour cream, the vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste. Transfer the filling to a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch decorative tip and pipe it into the egg-white halves, mounding it. Garnish the stuffed eggs with 2 reserved sun-dried tomatoes, cut into julienne strips, and the parsley.

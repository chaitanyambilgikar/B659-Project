Cut corn from cobs (reserve cobs) and put in a large saucepan with water, butter, 1 tsp salt, and 1/2 tsp pepper. Simmer over medium heat, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender, 5 to 7 minutes.
Meanwhile, scrape cobs in a small saucepan to extract "milk." Whisk in cream and flour. Boil over medium heat, whisking constantly, 1 minute. Carefully transfer cream mixture and 2 cups corn with some of cooking liquid to a blender and purée (use caution when blending hot liquids). Stir purée into corn and simmer 5 minutes. Stir in chives; season with salt and pepper.

Preheat oven to 350°F. Line heavy 18 x 12 x 1- inch baking sheet with parchment paper. Whisk first 3 ingredients in medium bowl. Using electric mixer, beat eggs, sugar, and vanilla in large bowl until very pale and thick, about 5 minutes. Beat in butter, then milk. Fold in flour mixture, then beat just until blended, about 30 seconds. Spread batter evenly into prepared baking sheet.
Bake cake until tester inserted into center comes out clean and cake begins to color on top, 26 to 28 minutes. Cool cake completely on baking sheet on rack.
Using 4-inch heart-shaped cookie cutter, cut out 8 hearts from cake (cover and reserve leftover cake). Spread thin layer of jam over top of 1 cake heart. Spread 1 heaping teaspoon of lemon curd over; top with another cake heart. Repeat with remaining hearts, jam, and lemon curd. Sprinkle each with powdered sugar.

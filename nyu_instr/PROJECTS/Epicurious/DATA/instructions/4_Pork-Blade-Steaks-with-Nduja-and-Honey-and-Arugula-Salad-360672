Combine 3 cups water, 6 tablespoons coarse salt, and sugar in 15 x 10 x 2-inch glass baking dish. Stir until salt and sugar dissolve. Place pork steaks in brine in baking dish. Cover and chill at least 2 hours and up to 4 hours.
Remove pork steaks from brine; pat dry. Brush both sides of steaks with 1 tablespoon oil; sprinkle with coarse salt and pepper. Heat griddle over medium-high heat until almost smoking. Place steaks on griddle and cook 3 minutes. Turn steaks over on griddle; immediately top each steak with nduja slices, dividing equally. Cook until pork is cooked through, about 3 minutes longer (nduja will soften).
Transfer steaks to platter, nduja side down. Spoon 1/2 tablespoon honey over each.
Toss arugula, cheese, lemon juice, and 2 tablespoons oil in bowl. Season salad with coarse salt and pepper; serve with steaks.
What to drink:A robust red wine would be terrific with the pork. The Quinta da Garrida 2007 Vinho Tinto (Portugal, $11) is a good choice.

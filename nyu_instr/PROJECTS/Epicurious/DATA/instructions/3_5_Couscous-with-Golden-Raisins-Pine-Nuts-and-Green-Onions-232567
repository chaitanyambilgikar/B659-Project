Bring broth and salt to boil in heavy large pot; turn off heat. Immediately mix in couscous and raisins. Cover and let stand until couscous is tender and broth is absorbed, about 15 minutes. Fluff couscous with fork. Mix in nuts, green onions, and butter. Season to taste with pepper. Transfer to bowl. Serve warm or at room temperature.

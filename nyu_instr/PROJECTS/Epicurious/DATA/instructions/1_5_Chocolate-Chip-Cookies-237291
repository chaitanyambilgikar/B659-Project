Grease the slow cooker insert with butter or vegetable oil. Cut a piece of waxed paper to fit the bottom and grease the waxed paper.
In a bowl, beat the butter, eggs, sugars, and vanilla together until light and fluffy. In a separate bowl, stir the flour, baking soda, and salt together. Stir the dry ingredients into the butter mixture. Stir in the chocolate chips and walnuts until well blended.
Spoon the dough evenly into the slow cooker and smooth the top. Cover and cook on low for about 3 hours, until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Set the lid slightly ajar for the last 30 minutes.
Turn off the heat and remove the insert from the slow cooker. Allow to cool in the insert for 30 minutes. Invert onto a wire rack. Cut the cake in half lengthwise, then cut each piece crosswise into slices. Serve warm or at room temperature.

Place escarole in bowl. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons oil; sprinkle with 1 teaspoon salt and pinch of ground black pepper. Let stand 5 minutes.
Heat large skillet over high heat. Cook escarole until browned and wilted, about 6 minutes; turn and cook until tender, about 3 minutes. Transfer to cutting board and cool. Cut off root end and any blackened pieces from escarole and discard, then coarsely chop escarole.
Whisk 4 tablespoons oil, vinegar, minced garlic, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in medium bowl. Season with pepper. Add escarole and toss to coat; let stand at least 15 minutes and up to 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 400°F. Brush bread slices on 1 side with additional olive oil. Place oiled side up on baking sheet and bake until golden, about 6 minutes. Rub bread with halved garlic.
Meanwhile, cook bacon in large skillet over medium-high heat until brown but not crisp.
Place 2 crostini on each of 4 plates. Divide escarole among crostini; top each with 1 bacon piece and 1 cheese slice. Sprinkle with salt and black pepper. Top each with 1 teaspoon mostarda.
Ingredient guide: A sweet-tart Italian condiment made of fruit preserved in syrup, mostarda contains only a bit of mustard and is served like a chutney with savory foods. You'll find it at some supermarkets, Italian markets, specialty foods stores, and cheese stores.

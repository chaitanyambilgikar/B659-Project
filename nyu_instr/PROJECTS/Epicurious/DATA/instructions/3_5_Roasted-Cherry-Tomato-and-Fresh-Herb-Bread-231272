Preheat oven to 375°F. Mix tomatoes, 1/4 cup oil, shallots, vinegar, and crushed red pepper in 13x9x2-inch glass baking dish. Roast uncovered until tomatoes are very tender and juicy, stirring occasionally, about 45 minutes. Stir in 2 tablespoons marjoram. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
Brush cut surface of each bread half lightly with additional oil. Arrange bread, cut side up, on baking sheet. Distribute about 1 cup tomato mixture over each bread half. Bake until bread is crusty, about 10 minutes. Transfer to cutting board. Sprinkle with additional marjoram and freshly ground black pepper. Cut bread into squares and serve.

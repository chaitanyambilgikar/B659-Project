Puree first 4 ingredients in blender until smooth. (Vinaigrette can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and chill. Bring to room temperature and whisk before using.)
Bring wine, olive oil, and shallot to simmer in large skillet over medium-high heat. Add scallops; simmer until opaque in center, about 1 minute. Using slotted spoon, transfer scallops to medium bowl, reserving juices in skillet; cool scallops and juices. Whisk 1/3 cup juices into vinaigrette. Season with salt and pepper. Toss scallops with 3 tablespoons vinaigrette.
Line each of 8 plates with 5 endive leaves. Combine remaining endive leaves, greens, tomatoes, bell pepper, and onion in large bowl. Toss with enough vinaigrette to coat salad. Divide salad among plates. Divide scallops among salads; serve.

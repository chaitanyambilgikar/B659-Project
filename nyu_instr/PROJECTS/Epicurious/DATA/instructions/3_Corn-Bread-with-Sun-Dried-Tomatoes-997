Preheat oven to 400°F. Butter two 9 1/2-inch-diameter deep-dish pie dishes. Combine cornmeal, flour, sugar, sage, pepper, salt, baking powder and baking soda in large bowl and whisk to blend. Combine buttermilk, sun-dried tomatoes, reserved sun-dried tomato oil, butter, eggs and egg yolk in medium bowl and whisk to blend. Stir buttermilk mixture into dry ingredients. Divide corn bread batter between prepared dishes.
Bake corn breads until tops begin to brown and tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool slightly. (Corn breads can be prepared 6 hours ahead. Cool completely. Cover with aluminum foil. Reheat covered in 350°F oven about 10 minutes.)
Cut corn breads into wedges. Transfer to towel-lined basket; serve warm.

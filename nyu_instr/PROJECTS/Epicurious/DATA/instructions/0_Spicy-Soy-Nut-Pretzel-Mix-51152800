PREHEAT the oven to 375° F. Lightly coat a baking sheet with vegetable cooking spray.
COMBINE all the ingredients in a large bowl and toss to coat evenly with the spices. Bake the mix until deep brown in color, 30 to 34 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool on the baking sheet. (The mixture will also crisp as it cools.)
TRANSFER the mix to a decorative bowl and serve at room temperature.

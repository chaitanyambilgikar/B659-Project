Preheat oven to 350°F. Grease cookie sheets. Using electric mixer, beat first 4 ingredients in large bowl until well blended. Beat in sugar, egg and vanilla extract. Mix flour, baking powder and baking soda in medium bowl. Stir dry ingredients into butter mixture alternately with orange juice, beginning and ending with dry ingredients.
Divide dough into 6 balls. Divide each ball into 6 pieces. Roll out 1 dough piece between palms of hands and lightly floured surface to 16-inch-long rope. Fold rope lengthwise in half. Twist folded rope 4 to 5 times. Bend 1 end to form candy cane hook and place on prepared cookie sheet. Repeat with remaining dough pieces. Brush cookies with egg glaze and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Bake until light golden brown, about 25 minutes. Cool. (Can be made 1 week ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.)

Bring milk, rice, and salt to simmer in heavy medium saucepan. Reduce heat to low. Cover and gently simmer until rice is very tender and liquid is almost absorbed, stirring occasionally, about 1 1/2 hours.
Whisk milk, eggs, sugar, vanilla, and cinnamon to blend in medium bowl. Stir in raisins. Gradually stir egg mixture into rice mixture. Stir over low heat until mixture is just thickened, about 6 minutes. Transfer to bowl. Stir in optional molasses. Cool. Refrigerate until well chilled. (Can be prepared 2 days ahead.)

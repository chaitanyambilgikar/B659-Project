Mix first 5 ingredients in medium bowl. (Can be made 3 days ahead. Cover and chill. Bring to room temperature before using.)
Preheat oven to 375°F. Lightly pierce potatoes all over with fork. Set potatoes directly on oven rack; bake until tender when pierced with skewer, about 1 hour. Cut cross in top of each potato. Using oven mitts to protect hands, squeeze potatoes gently in from sides, forcing crosses to open. Spoon 1 tablespoon butter into each potato. Serve, passing remaining butter separately.

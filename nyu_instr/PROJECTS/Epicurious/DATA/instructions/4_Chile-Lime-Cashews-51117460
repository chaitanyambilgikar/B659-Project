Preheat oven to 325°F. Combine 4 cups raw cashews, 15 dried chiles de árbol, 10 kaffir lime leaves (optional) cut into 1/4" slices, 2 tablespoons melted unsalted butter, 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, 1 tablespoon kosher salt, and 1 1/2 teaspoons ground ancho chiles in a large bowl; toss to coat. Spread nut mixture in an even layer on a large rimmed baking sheet. Roast, stirring occasionally, until cashews are evenly toasted and fragrant, about 20 minutes. Let nut mixture cool completely on sheet on a wire rack. Transfer nuts to a large bowl and toss with 2 tablespoons finely grated lime zest, making sure to evenly distribute spices and zest. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.

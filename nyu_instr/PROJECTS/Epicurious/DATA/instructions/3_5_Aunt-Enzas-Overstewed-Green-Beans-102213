Put the onion and the garlic in a heavy-bottomed 3-quart pot, drizzle with 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil, and stir to coat the vegetables.
Place the pot over low heat and cook the onion and garlic for 10 minutes or until tender.
Add the tomato, green beans, and pepper (or hot pepper) and season with salt. Bring to a simmer and cover with a tight-fitting lid. Cooking time will depend on the quality and freshness of the beans, which should be tender and soft. Check after 10 minutes to make sure that cooking liquid is sufficient. Add 1/4 cup boiling water if necessary. If beans expel too much water, uncover and cook over high heat to thicken sauce.
Add the basil, cook for 2-3 minutes, remove from heat, and stir in remaining 2 tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil.

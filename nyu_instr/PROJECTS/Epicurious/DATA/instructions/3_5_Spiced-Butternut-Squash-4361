Heat oils in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add squash and 1 teaspoon garlic; sauté until squash begins to soften, about 8 minutes. Add broth and wine. Boil until most of liquid is absorbed, about 8 minutes. Stir in ginger, five-spice powder, cayenne and remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons garlic. Cover; reduce heat to medium-low. Cook until liquid is absorbed and squash is tender, about 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Cook chayotes in a 4- to 6-quart pot of boiling salted water until crisp-tender, about 6 minutes. Drain well in a colander, then, while still hot, toss with dressing. Cool to room temperature.
Cut hearts of palm diagonally into 1/4-inch-thick slices, then add to chayote mixture along with celery, parsley, cilantro, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt. Gently toss.

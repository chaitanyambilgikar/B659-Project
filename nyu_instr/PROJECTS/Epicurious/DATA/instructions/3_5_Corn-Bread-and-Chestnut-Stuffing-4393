Preheat oven to 350°F. Cut bread into 1-inch cubes. Spread on large baking sheet. Bake until dry but not firm, about 25 minutes. Cool. Coarsely crumble into very large bowl. Maintain oven temperature.
Butter 13x9x2-inch glass baking dish. Melt 3 tablespoons butter in large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions and celery; sauté until tender, about 7 minutes. Add to corn bread. Mix in 2 1/4 cups broth and herbs. Stir in chestnuts. Season with salt and pepper. Mix in egg. Add up to 1/2 cup more broth if stuffing seems dry.
Transfer to prepared dish. Cover; bake 30 minutes. Uncover and bake until top begins to brown, about 30 minutes longer.

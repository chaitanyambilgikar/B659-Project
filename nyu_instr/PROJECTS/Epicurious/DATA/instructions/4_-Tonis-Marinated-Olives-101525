Chop tarragon and thyme and mince anchovies. In a deep bowl stir together all ingredients except vinegar. Marinate olive mixture, covered and chilled, stirring occasionally, at least 6 hours and up to 3 days. Bring olive mixture to room temperature before proceeding.
To serve olives, transfer to a bowl with a slotted spoon and drizzle with vinegar to taste.

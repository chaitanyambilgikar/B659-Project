Prepare a gas grill for indirect-heat cooking by preheating all burners on high, covered, 10 minutes.
Butterfly lamb horizontally through middle (without cutting all the way through, so piece opens out like a book to double its size and is 1 to 1 1/2 inches thick). Pierce meat in several places with tip of a sharp knife (so seasoning will penetrate).
Finely grind together cumin, coriander, and peppercorns in grinder. Mince and mash garlic to a paste with 1 teaspoon salt, then stir together with ground spices and yogurt in a bowl to make a paste.
Rub paste all over lamb.
Reduce grill heat to medium-high and oil grill rack. Sear lamb over middle burner, covered, turning once, until well browned, 2 to 3 minutes total.
Turn off middle burner (burner under lamb if there are only 2) and grill, covered, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into center of meat registers 120 to 125°F for medium-rare, 4 to 6 minutes more. Transfer to a cutting board and let stand, loosely covered with foil, 10 minutes before slicing.
Serve with: orzo with feta, tomatoes, and dill , corn on the cob

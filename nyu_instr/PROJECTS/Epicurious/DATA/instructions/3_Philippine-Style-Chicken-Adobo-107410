Stir together vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, bay leaves, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper in a bowl, then pour into a sealable plastic bag. Add chicken and seal bag, pressing out air. Turn to coat thoroughly, then put bag in a baking pan and marinate chicken, chilled, turning occasionally, 2 hours.
Let chicken stand at room temperature 45 minutes.
Preheat oven to 425°F.
Arrange chicken, skin sides up, in 1 layer in a 13- by 9- by 2-inch metal baking pan and pour marinade over it. Bake in middle of oven until cooked through, 30 to 35 minutes. Transfer chicken, skin sides up, to a broiler pan. Pour marinade into a small saucepan and skim fat.
Preheat broiler.
Broil chicken about 4 inches from heat until skin is golden and crisp, 2 to 3 minutes. While chicken is broiling, bring marinade to a boil and discard bay leaves. Serve chicken with sauce.

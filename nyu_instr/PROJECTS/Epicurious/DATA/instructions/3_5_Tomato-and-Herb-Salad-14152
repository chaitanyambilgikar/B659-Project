Make vinaigrette: In a small bowl whisk together lime juice, salt, sugar, and pepper and add oil in a stream, whisking.
Cut tomatoes into 1/2-inch-thick slices and arrange decoratively on a platter. Drizzle tomatoes with about two thirds vinaigrette.
In a bowl combine herbs and scallions and toss with remaining vinaigrette.
Mound herb mixture on top of tomato slices.

Make sauce: In a bowl stir together soy sauce, honey, lime juice, and gingerroot until combined well. Sauce may be made 3 days ahead and chilled, covered. Bring sauce to room temperature before serving. Stir in coriander.
Make shrimp paste: In a food processor pulse shrimp paste ingredients together until they just form a smooth paste. Shrimp paste may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.
Make batter: In a blender blend batter ingredients until smooth. Transfer to s shallow bowl.
Assemble nori rolls: On a work surface arrange 1 nori sheet, shiny side down, with a long side facing you. Spread 1/2 cup shrimp paste across lower two thirds of nori and brush top third of nori with sauce. Arrange 1 scallion quarter on shrimp paste across bottom edge and top with 3 carrot strips.
Top carrot evenly with one fourth bell pepper strips and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon coriander. Beginning with edge closest to you, roll up nori tightly and trim ends if necessary. Make 3 more rolls with remaining nori, shrimp paste, sauce, vegetables, and coriander in same manner. Rolls may be assembled 1 day ahead and chilled, covered. Bring rolls to room temperature before preceeding.
In a deep heavy skillet heat 3 inches oil to 375°F. on a deep-fat thermometer. Dip 1 roll in batter to coat completely. Transfer roll to hot oil with 2 pairs of metal tongs and fry until golden, about 4 minutes. Transfer roll to paper towels to drain and fry remaining 3 rills in same manner, making sure oil returns to 375°F. before adding next roll.
Cut rolls diagonally into 1/2-inch-thick slices and serve warm or at room temperature with dipping sauce.

In a saucepan simmer the water and the vinegar with the sliced whole scallion, the gingerroot, the sugar, the soy sauce, and the ketchup, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes, add the sesame oil and the cornstarch mixture, stirred, and simmer the sauce, stirring, for 2 minutes. Keep the sauce warm, covered.
In a bag shake the halibut in the flour, transfer it to a large sieve or colander, and shake it to remove the excess. In a large deep skillet heat 1/4 inch of the vegetable oil over moderately high heat until it is hot but not smoking and in it fry the halibut in 2 batches, turning it, for 2 to 3 minutes, or until it is cooked through, transferring it as it is cooked with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain. Add the halibut to the sauce, stirring to coat it well, and serve it over the rice and sprinkle with the scallion greens.

Preheat oven to 425°F.
Halve fruit crosswise and discard any visible seeds. Cut segments free from membranes with a sharp paring knife without removing them.
Arrange grapefruit halves, cut sides up, on a baking sheet and sprinkle tops evenly with brown sugar.
Beat egg whites with cream of tartar and a pinch of salt in a bowl with an electric mixer at medium speed until whites just hold soft peaks. Gradually add granulated sugar, beating at high speed until meringue is stiff and glossy.
Generously dollop (or, alternatively, decoratively pipe) meringue onto grapefruit halves and bake in middle of oven until meringue is golden, 7 to 8 minutes. Serve immediately.
* Just Whites (can be substituted for the egg whites, which are not fully cooked, if salmonella is a problem in your area). Available at many supermarkets and New York Cake & Baking Distributors (800-942-2539).

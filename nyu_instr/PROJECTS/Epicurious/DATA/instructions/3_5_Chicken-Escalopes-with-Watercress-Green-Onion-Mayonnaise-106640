Place each chicken breast between sheets of plastic wrap. Using meat mallet or rolling pin, pound chicken to 1/2-inch thickness. Cut each chicken breast lengthwise in half. Place chicken in glass baking dish. Pour remaining 2 tablespoons lemon juice and olive oil over chicken. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Turn to coat. Cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour or overnight.

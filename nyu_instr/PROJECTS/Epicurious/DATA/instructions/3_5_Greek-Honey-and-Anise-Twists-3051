Mix honey, 2 tablespoons liqueur and juice in small bowl. Set glaze aside.
Preheat oven to 350°F. Lightly butter baking sheets. Combine flour, salt and baking powder in medium bowl. Using electric mixer, beat butter and sugar in large bowl until fluffy. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in remaining 2 tablespoons liqueur, aniseed and lemon peel. Gradually mix in dry ingredients.
Working with 1 tablespoon dough at a time, roll dough between palms and work surface into 7-inch ropes. Form into bow ties or twists. Place on prepared baking sheets, spacing evenly. Brush glaze over cookies. Sprinkle with sesame seeds. Bake cookies until pale golden, about 15 minutes. Transfer cookies to racks. Lightly brush cookies again with glaze. Cool. (Can be made ahead. Store in airtight container at room temperature up to 1 week, or freeze up to 1 month.)

Heat oil in large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onions, bell peppers and garlic; sauté until beginning to soften, about 10 minutes. Mix in tomatoes with their juices, ham, wine, thyme, basil, paprika and cayenne pepper. Bring to boil. Gradually stir in rice. Cover pot. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer until rice is tender and most liquids are absorbed, about 25 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.

Rinse rice in a medium bowl in 3 or 4 changes of cold water, draining in a sieve each time, until water is completely clear. Drain in sieve 5 minutes.
Bring rice and water to a boil in a heavy medium pot. Reduce heat to as low as possible and cook, tightly covered, until rice is tender and water is absorbed, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, 10 minutes. Fluff with a fork.

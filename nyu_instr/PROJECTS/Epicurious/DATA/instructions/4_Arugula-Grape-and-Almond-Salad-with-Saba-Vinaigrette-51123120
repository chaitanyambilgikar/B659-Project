Stir in shallot, 1 tablespoon Sherry vinegar, and 1/4 teaspoon salt and let sit for 5 minutes. Whisk in oil and 1 tablespoon saba. Season vinaigrette to taste with salt, pepper, and more Sherry vinegar, if desired. DO AHEAD: Vinaigrette and halved grapes can be prepared 8 hours ahead. Cover and chill vinaigrette and grapes separately. Bring vinaigrette to room temperature and rewhisk before continuing.

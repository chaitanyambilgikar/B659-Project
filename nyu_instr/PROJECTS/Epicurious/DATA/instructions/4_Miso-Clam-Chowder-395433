Melt 1 tablespoon unsalted butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add 3 ounces chopped pancetta (Italian bacon). Cook until slightly rendered, 5-6 minutes. Add 1/2 cup chopped onion, 2 chopped garlic cloves, and 1 sprig thyme. Cook, stirring often, until onion is soft, 4-5 minutes. Add 1 cup dry white wine; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer for 2 minutes. Add 1 pound russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2" cubes, 2 cups low-salt chicken broth, 1 cup heavy cream, and 2 tablespoons miso. Simmer until potatoes are tender, 20-30 minutes. Add 12 scrubbed littleneck clams. Cover; cook until clams open, 5-7 minutes. Season with Tabasco; garnish with chopped flat-leaf parsley.

Preheat oven to 350°F. Pierce sweet potatoes all over with fork. Place potatoes on rimmed baking sheet. Roast until potatoes are very soft, about 1 hour 45 minutes. Remove potatoes from oven and let stand until cool enough to handle. Peel potatoes and place flesh in mixing bowl; add butter. Using electric mixer, beat until mixture is fluffy and smooth. Mix in 2 tablespoons honey. Season to taste with salt and pepper and more honey by teaspoonfuls, if desired. Transfer sweet potatoes to serving bowl. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature. Rewarm in microwave until heated through before serving.

Sprinkle gelatin over Sherry in a small bowl to soften. Heat cream, sugar, and zest, stirring until sugar is dissolved, and remove from heat. Stir in gelatin mixture until dissolved. Pour through a fine sieve into a large glass measure and pour into 8 (1/4-cup) molds. Cool flummeries completely and chill, covered, 6 hours. To unmold flummeries, dip molds, 1 at a time, into a bowl of hot water 2 seconds and gently pull edges away from molds with your fingertips. Invert desserts onto plates.

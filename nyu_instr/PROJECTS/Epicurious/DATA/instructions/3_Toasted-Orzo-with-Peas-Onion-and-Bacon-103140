Heat large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add orzo and stir until beginning to color, about 10 minutes. Transfer orzo to small bowl. Add onion and bacon to same skillet. Sauté until bacon browns and onion is tender, about 15 minutes. Add 3 1/4 cups broth and orzo and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover and simmer until broth is absorbed and orzo is tender, about 18 minutes. Mix in peas. Add more broth if mixture is dry. Cover and cook until peas are just warmed through, about 2 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve.

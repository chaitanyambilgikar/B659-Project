Heat the grill to medium-high.
Prepare the seitan: Marinate the seitan in the olive oil to cover for 1 hour. Grill the seitan until lightly browned, 3 to 5 minutes or longer, turning often. Transfer to a bowl.
Meanwhile, make the sauce, if using: In a glass measure, whisk together the hot sauce, maple syrup, lime juice, salt, and cayenne pepper to taste. Microwave the mixture for 1 minute or until fairly hot, or whisk the mixture together in a small saucepan and place it over direct heat on the grill until it is hot, 4 to 5 minutes, or longer depending on the grill. Add the mixture to the seitan bowl and stir gently to combine, or coat the seitan if it is skewered. Finish with the optional oregano. Serve with extra sauce and celery sticks.

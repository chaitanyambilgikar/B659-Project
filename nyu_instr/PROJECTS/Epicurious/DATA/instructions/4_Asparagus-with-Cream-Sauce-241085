Steam asparagus in a steamer rack over boiling water, covered, until crisp-tender, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a plate and keep warm, loosely covered with foil.
Put broiler pan (with unlined rack) in broiler and preheat broiler 5 minutes.
Generously butter bread slices on 1 side, then halve diagonally. Arrange bread, buttered sides up, on rack of hot broiler pan and broil 4 to 5 inches from heat until golden-brown in some spots and undersides are toasted, 2 to 3 minutes (watch carefully).
Briskly simmer cream, ham, garlic, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper in a 12-inch heavy skillet, stirring occasionally, until sauce has thickened and is reduced to about 3/4 cup, about 3 minutes. (If necessary, keep warm, covered.)
Arrange asparagus on toast, then stir sauce and spoon over asparagus.

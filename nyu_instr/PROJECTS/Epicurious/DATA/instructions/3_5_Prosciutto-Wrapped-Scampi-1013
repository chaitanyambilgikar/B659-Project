Combine shrimp, wine, oil, garlic and crushed pepper in bowl; toss to coat. Let stand at room temperature 1 hour.
Preheat broiler. Drain shrimp, reserving marinade. Wrap 1 prosciutto strip around each shrimp. Arrange 3 shrimp in each of 4 shallow broiler-proof dishes, tucking ends of prosciutto strips under shrimp. Drizzle 1 tablespoon marinade over shrimp in each dish.
Broil shrimp about 6 inches from heat source until prosciutto begins to crisp and shrimp are cooked through; watch closely to avoid burning, about 6 minutes. Sprinkle with parsley. Serve with lemon wedges.

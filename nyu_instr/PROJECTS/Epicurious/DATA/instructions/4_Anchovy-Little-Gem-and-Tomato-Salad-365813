Preheat oven to 400°. Place tomatoes in an 8x8x2" glass baking dish. Season with salt and pepper, then drizzle with oil. Roast tomatoes until softened, about 30 minutes. Let cool. Transfer tomatoes to a large bowl, leaving juices behind. Pour vinaigrette into baking dish and whisk into the tomato juices to blend.
Add anchovies and lettuce to bowl with tomatoes. Drizzle vinaigrette over. Toss salad to coat (it's best if you use your hands). Season salad to taste with salt and pepper. Sprinkle parsley over and serve.

Preheat oven to 350°F. Rub garlic heads with 1 tablespoon oil. Place in small baking dish; cover with foil. Bake until garlic is tender, about 1 hour. Cut tops off garlic; squeeze out roasted garlic and reserve.
Heat 4 tablespoons oil in heavy large pot over medium-low heat. Add leeks, onions and celery; sauté until tender but not brown, about 20 minutes. Add coriander; stir 2 minutes. Add potatoes; stir 2 minutes. Add roasted garlic and 8 cups stock; bring to boil. Reduce heat; simmer until potatoes are very tender, about 20 minutes. Cool slightly. Working in batches, puree soup in blender. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cool slightly. Chill, then cover.)
Heat 3 tablespoons oil in large skillet over medium heat. Add shallots; sauté until deep golden, about 15 minutes.
Bring soup to simmer in heavy large pot. Thin with more stock, if desired. Season with salt and pepper. Ladle into bowls. Top with caramelized shallots.

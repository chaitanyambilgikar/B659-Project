Pour 1 cup cranberry juice into small bowl. Sprinkle gelatin over. Let stand until gelatin softens, about 20 minutes.
Combine cranberries and sugar in processor. Blend, using on/off turns, until cranberries are finely chopped. Transfer berry mixture to heavy large saucepan; add remaining 2 1/2 cups cranberry juice and lemon juice. Bring berry mixture to boil over medium-high heat, stirring until sugar dissolves. Reduce heat to medium, cover pan partially and simmer until cranberry pieces are tender, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes. Remove from heat. Add gelatin mixture and stir until gelatin dissolves. Cool to lukewarm, about 30 minutes. Mix in celery.
Rinse 8- to 9-cup decorative mold with cold water and drain well. Spoon cranberry mixture into mold. Cover and refrigerate until cold and firm, at least 8 hours and up to 2 days.
Turn mold over onto platter. Soak kitchen towel in very hot water; wring out. Wrap hot towel around mold. Let stand 1 minute. Remove towel. Hold mold and platter together and shake gently until cranberry salad falls onto platter. Repeat with hot towel if necessary to unmold salad. Chill until ready to serve.

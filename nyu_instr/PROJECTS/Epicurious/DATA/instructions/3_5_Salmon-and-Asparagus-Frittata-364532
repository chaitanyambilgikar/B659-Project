Bring lightly salted water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Boil potatoes until just tender, about 7 minutes; drain. Heat broiler to low. Combine eggs, egg whites, salt and pepper in a bowl. Heat oil in a 12" ovenproof nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Cook onion, bell pepper and oregano, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are somewhat soft, about 3 minutes. Add asparagus and potatoes; cook 3 minutes. Add salmon and cook until opaque, 3 minutes. Pour egg mixture into skillet; reduce heat to low. Cook, stirring occasionally, until egg begins to set but is still wet on top, 5 minutes. Cook, without stirring, 5 minutes. Transfer skillet to broiler; broil until golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from broiler and slice into 4 wedges; serve.

To make machaca, heat oil in a skillet on medium heat. Add onion and pepper and sauté about 3 minutes. Stir in meat and continue sautéing until meat is brown and crispy but not burned. (Scrape meat from the bottom occasionally.) Stir in broth and 1/2 cup salsa and add cinnamon stick. Bring mixture to a boil. Reduce to medium and cook until most of the liquid evaporates but the meat remains moist. Salt to taste. Remove cinnamon stick. Mix eggs into machaca and continue cooking 1 or 2 minutes until eggs are just firm. Spoon 1/6 mixture onto each tortilla and roll up. Place on a plate and spoon remaining salsa over each burro.

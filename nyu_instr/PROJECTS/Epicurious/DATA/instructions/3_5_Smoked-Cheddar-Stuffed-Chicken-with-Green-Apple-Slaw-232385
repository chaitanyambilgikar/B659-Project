For chicken: Stir cheddar cheese, 1 tablespoon maple syrup, cream cheese, and sage in small bowl to blend. Place 1 chicken breast, skin side down, on work surface. Using small sharp knife, cut 1 1/2-inch-deep by 2-inch-long horizontal pocket in chicken. Pack in 1/4 of stuffing. Press tenderloin into pocket opening to seal in stuffing. Repeat with remaining chicken and stuffing. Arrange chicken on small baking sheet. Combine 1/4 cup maple syrup, whisky, brown sugar, and butter in small saucepan. Whisk over medium heat until sauce comes to simmer and is blended. (Chicken and basting sauce can be made 1 day ahead. Cover separately and refrigerate.)
For green apple slaw: Whisk first 5 ingredients in medium bowl to blend. Mix in apple, red onion, and green onions. Season slaw to taste with salt and pepper. Refrigerate at least 1 hour and up to 4 hours, tossing occasionally.
Spray grill rack with nonstick spray and prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Rewarm basting sauce; transfer half to bowl and reserve. Set pan with remaining sauce at edge of grill to keep warm. Grill chicken, skin side down, until golden, about 3 minutes. Turn chicken over, repositioning over medium to medium-low heat. Grill until cooked through, turning occasionally and basting with sauce in pan during last 5 minutes, about 8 minutes. Transfer chicken to platter. Serve with apple slaw, passing reserved sauce separately.

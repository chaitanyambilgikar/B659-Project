Preheat oven to 350°F. Lightly grease a 9- by 9-inch or 11- by 7-inch baking dish. Set aside.
Whisk together the milk, eggs, rosemary, and salt and pepper to taste in a medium bowl.
Place bread cubes in another medium bowl. Sprinkle with the cheese and drizzle with the milk mixture, making sure to coat all the bread cubes well. Allow the bread cubes to soak for 5 to 10 minutes, until bread is moist.
Pour bread mixture into the prepared dish and bake in the oven for 20 to 35 minutes, until the top is golden brown and gives resistance to the touch, or a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Remove from the oven and let cool for a few minutes before serving.

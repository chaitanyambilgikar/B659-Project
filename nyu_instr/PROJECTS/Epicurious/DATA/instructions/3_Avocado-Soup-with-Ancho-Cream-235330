For soup: Combine 1 cup vegetable broth and next 3 ingredients in processor; blend until smooth. Add remaining 1 1/2 cups broth and blend. Transfer to large bowl. Stir in cream. Cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour and up to 1 day. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
For ancho cream: Stem chile, halve, and remove seeds. Heat small skillet over medium heat. Add chile and toast pieces on each side until pliable and aromatic, turning occasionally, about 2 minutes. Transfer chile to small bowl and add hot water just to cover. Soak until soft, about 30 minutes. Drain water; transfer chile to mini processor and purée. Strain ancho purée into small bowl, pressing on solids. Place whipping cream in another small bowl; whisk in 1 tablespoon ancho purée. Chill ancho cream until ready to use.
Do ahead: Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.
Ladle soup into 6 bowls. Drizzle ancho cream over and serve.
*Ancho chiles are dried poblanos. They are available at some supermarkets, at specialty foods stores, and at Latin markets.

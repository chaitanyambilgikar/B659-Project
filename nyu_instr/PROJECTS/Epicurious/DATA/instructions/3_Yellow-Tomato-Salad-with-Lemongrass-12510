In a small bowl whisk together the oil, the lemongrass, the shallots, the lemon juice, the garlic, the zest, the coriander, the cayenne, and salt to taste. Divide the tomato slices among 6 salad plates, spoon the dressing over them, and let the salad stand at room temperature for at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour. Garnish each serving with some of the whole tomatoes.

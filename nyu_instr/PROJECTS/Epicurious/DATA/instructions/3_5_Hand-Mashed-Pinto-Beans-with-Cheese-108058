Place beans in heavy large pot. Add 10 cups water, green onions, and 1 tablespoon lard. Bring to boil over high heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover partially, and simmer until beans are just tender, about 55 minutes. Mix in 1 teaspoon fine sea salt. Cover partially and continue to simmer until beans are very soft, adding more water by cupfuls if water level falls below top of beans, about 20 minutes longer.
Heat remaining 1/3 cup lard in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add white onion and sauté until beginning to brown, about 8 minutes. Add garlic; stir 1 minute. Using slotted spoon, transfer beans to skillet. Mash with potato masher to coarse, lumpy puree. Mix in enough bean cooking liquid (about 1/2 cup) to moisten. Mix in cheese. Season to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cool 30 minutes. Cover beans and liquid separately and refrigerate. Rewarm beans over low heat, mixing in bean cooking liquid by 1/4 cupfuls if dry.)
Serve beans warm with tortillas.
*Light yellow, semi-soft mild cheese that is different from the aged Spanish cheese of the same name. Substitute mild cheddar, Monterey Jack, or Muenster.

1. In a small saucepan, combine the tomatillos with enough water to come about halfway up the side of the pan, cover, and cook over medium heat until they are soft, about 10 minutes; strain, reserving the liquid.
2. Meanwhile, on a plancha or in a heavy skillet, melt the lard over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook until soft and well charred on all sides, 5 to 10 minutes; transfer to the jar of an electric blender.
3. Add the chiles to plancha and toast for 2 minutes per side. Remove, tear them into pieces, and add them to the blender. Pour in the reserved cooking liquid, add a large pinch of salt, and blend until smooth. Add the tomatillos, blend, and taste to adjust the salt, as necessary.

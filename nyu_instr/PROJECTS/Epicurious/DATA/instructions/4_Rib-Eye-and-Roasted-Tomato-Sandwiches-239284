While tomatoes cool, prepare grill for direct-heat cooking over hot charcoal (medium-high heat for gas).
Sprinkle each steak all over with 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper (total per steak). Oil grill rack, then grill steaks, covered only if using a gas grill, turning over once, 5 to 6 minutes total for medium-rare. Transfer to a cutting board.

Make Pizza dough In a large bowl stir together water and yeast and let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. Stir in flour and salt and blend until mixture forms a dough, adding additional tablespoon water if too dry. On a lightly floured surface knead dough about 10 minutes, or until smooth and elastic. (Alternatively, dough may be made in a standing electric mixer. In bowl of mixture make dough as described above. With dough hook knead dough about 5 minutes, or until smooth and elastic.)
Put dough in a very lightly oiled deep bowl, turning to coat, and let rise, covered loosely, in a warm place 1 1/2 hours, or until doubled in bulk. Punch dough and divide into 4 equal pieces. Dough keeps, each piece put in a small, sealable plastic bag and sealed, pressing out excess air, chilled overnight or frozen 2 weeks. If dough is frozen, thaw overnight in refrigerator before using. Makes enough dough for four 12 by 6-inch oval pizzas.
Make the Pizzas Preheat the oven to 500°F.
In a large heavy non-stick skillet heat oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and sauté mushrooms and garlic with Sherry, lemon juice, and salt to taste 10 minutes, or until liquid is evaporated. Cool mixture slightly. Mushroom mixture may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.
On a work surface sprinkled with 1 teaspoon cornmeal roll out 1 piece of dough into a 12 by 6-inch oval and transfer to a baking sheet. Repeat with remaining cornmeal and dough, ending up with 2 ovals on each of 2 baking sheets.
Stir parsley and Gruyère into mushroom mixture and spread evenly on dough ovals, leaving a 1/2-inch border around edge of each pizza.
Bake pizzas in lower and middle thirds of oven 15 minutes, or until crusts are crisp and pale golden.

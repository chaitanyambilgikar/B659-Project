If using duck leg, peel off skin and reserve. Remove meat from bones, discarding bones, and shred meat.
Cut reserved duck skin into thin strips and in a small non-stick skillet cook over moderate heat until fat is rendered and skin is crisp and golden brown. Transfer cracklings with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain and season with salt.
With a sharp knife peel celery root and cut into 1/2-inch cubes. Thinly slice shallots and chop celery ribs.
In an 8-quart heavy kettle cook vegetables in butter with salt and pepper to taste over moderately high heat, stirring, until golden, about 6 minutes. Add water and boil, uncovered, until celery root is very tender, about 15 minutes.
In a blender purée mixture in batches (use caution when blending hot liquids) until smooth, transferring to a large saucepan. Stir in lemon juice and, if necessary, more water to reach desired consistency. Season soup with salt and pepper and keep warm.
In a non-stick skillet heat duck meat over moderate heat, stirring, just until hot and season with salt and pepper.

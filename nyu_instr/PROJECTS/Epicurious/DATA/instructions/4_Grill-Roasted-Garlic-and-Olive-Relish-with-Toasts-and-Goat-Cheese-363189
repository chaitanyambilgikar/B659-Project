Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Line each of 2 shallow soup bowls with large sheet of heavy-duty foil (18-inch- wide size), leaving overhang on all sides. Cut top 3/4 inch off each head of garlic, revealing cloves. Place 2 heads of garlic in each foil-lined bowl. Spoon 11/2 cups olives around garlic in each bowl. Sprinkle half of coriander and half of crushed red pepper over each. Drizzle each with 3 tablespoons oil. Fold foil overhang to center; seal packets tightly. Transfer packets from bowls to edge of grill. Cook until garlic is tender, opening packets to test garlic every 45 minutes, about 2 hours total. Open packets; cool 15 minutes.
Place 1 head of garlic in center of large shallow bowl. Working with 1 at a time, hold remaining garlic heads upside down and squeeze softened cloves into olive mixture in packets, dividing equally; stir to blend. Spoon olive-garlic relish from both packets around head of garlic in bowl.
Grill bread until crisp on 1 side, 3 to 4 minutes. Arrange toasts, cheese, and bowl of relish on platter; garnish with rosemary.

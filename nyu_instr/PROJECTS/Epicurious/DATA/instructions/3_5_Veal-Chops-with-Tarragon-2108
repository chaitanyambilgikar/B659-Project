Season veal with salt, pepper and 1 teaspoon tarragon; dust lightly with flour. Melt butter in heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add veal and cook until light brown and just cooked through, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer veal to plate. Add wine, broth, lemon juice and remaining 1 teaspoon tarragon to skillet. Boil until juices are syrupy, scraping up any brown bits, about 5 minutes. Return veal and any collected juices to skillet and cook until just heated through, about 1 minute.

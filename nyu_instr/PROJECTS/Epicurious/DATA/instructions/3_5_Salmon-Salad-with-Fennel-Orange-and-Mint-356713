Place sugar, vinegar, star anise, and 4 cups cold water in large deep skillet. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to boil over high heat, stirring until sugar dissolves. Add salmon fillet, skin side up, to skillet. Cover skillet and remove from heat. Let stand 10 minutes. Using slotted spoon, turn salmon over; cover and let stand until salmon is just opaque in center, 5 to 6 minutes longer. Remove salmon from liquid and cool. Coarsely flake salmon into medium bowl, removing bones and skin; set aside.

Working over large bowl, cut between membranes, releasing segments into bowl. Repeat with remaining orange. Add salmon, fennel, mint, and olive oil. Gently toss to combine. Season with salt and pepper.

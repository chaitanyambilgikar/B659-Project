Preheat oven to 500°F. Spray baking sheet with nonstick spray. Brush both sides of polenta slices with 1 tablespoon olive oil and arrange on prepared sheet. Bake until polenta is crusty, turning over after 7 minutes, about 14 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and sauté 3 minutes. Add tomatoes and vinegar and cook until tomatoes soften, about 3 minutes. Add roasted peppers, olives and basil and simmer 2 minutes. Season sauce with salt and pepper.
Arrange polenta on plates. Spoon sauce over and serve.

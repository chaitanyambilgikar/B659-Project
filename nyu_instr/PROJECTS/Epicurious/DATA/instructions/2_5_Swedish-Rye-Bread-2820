Place 1/4 cup warm water in small bowl. Sprinkle yeast over; stir to dissolve. Let stand 5 minutes. Combine remaining 2 cups warm water, 1 cup all purpose flour and 1 cup rye flour in bowl. Add yeast mixture. Mix to blend well. Cover bowl with kitchen towel. Let sponge rise 1 hour.
Mix sugar, corn syrup, shortening, aniseed, coriander, orange peel and salt into sponge. Gradually mix in enough all purpose flour, 1/2 cup at a time, to form slightly sticky dough. Knead on floured surface until smooth and elastic, adding more flour if sticky, about 10 minutes.
Lightly oil large bowl. Add dough, turning to coat entire surface. Cover bowl with kitchen towel. Let dough rise in warm draft-free area until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
Grease 2 cookie sheets. Punch dough down. Turn out onto lightly floured surface and knead until smooth. Divide dough into 3 parts. Pat each piece into 5-inch-diameter round. Place on prepared sheets. Cover and let rise in warm draft-free area until almost doubled, about 40 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350°F. Pierce each loaf 5 times with fork. Bake until loaves are brown and sound hollow when tapped on bottom, about 1 hour. Transfer to racks. Brush with butter and cool. Serve warm or at room temperature. (Can be made 1 month ahead. Wrap loaves tightly and freeze. Thaw before serving.)

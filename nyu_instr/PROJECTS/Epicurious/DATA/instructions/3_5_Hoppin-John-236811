In a large saucepan, fry the bacon over moderate heat till almost crisp and pour off all but about 1 tablespoon of the grease. Add the onion, celery, and garlic and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Add the peas, salt and pepper, red pepper flakes, and water, bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer till the peas are tender but not mushy, about 1 hour. Drain the peas, then serve them in small bowls over mounds of hot rice with a few spoonfuls of tomatoes on the tops.

Place the beef, lamb, and chicken in a large Dutch oven. Add the salt and water. Bring to a boil, skimming off any foam that rises to the surface. Reduce the heat, partially cover, and simmer until the beef and lamb are fork tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Remove the beef, lamb, and chicken pieces to a plate and let cool. Strain and measure the broth; it should be about 6 cups. With a paper towel, wipe the inside edges of the Dutch oven to remove any residue clinging to the pot. Pour the broth back into the Dutch oven. Stir in the onion, garlic, mixed vegetables, okra, butter beans, tomatoes, Worcestershire sauce, sorghum or molasses, ketchup, vinegar, cloves, and red pepper flakes. Bring to a simmer and cook for about 1 1/2 hours. Meanwhile, remove the chicken, beef, and lamb from the bones and cut into small pieces. Add the chopped meat to the vegetables and cook for about 1/2 hour to thicken the broth. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Stir in the parsley.

Make Brine: In a wide 6- to 8-quart pot whisk together 8 cups water, salt, and sugar until salt and sugar are dissolved.
Add pork chops to brine and let stand at room temperature for 1 hour.
Prepare grill for direct-heat grilling over medium-hot charcoal (medium-high heat for gas; see Grilling Procedure below).
Remove pork chops from brine, discarding brine, and pat chops dry with several layers of paper towels. Season chops with pepper.
Oil grill rack, then grill chops, covered only if using a gas grill, turning over occasionally and moving around if flare-ups occur, until browned, 2 to 3 minutes total.
Move chops to area with no coals underneath (if using gas, turn off a burner and move chops to area over shut-off burner) then cover with lid, and grill, turning and brushing with liquid, until thermometer inserted horizontally into center of chop as close to bone without touching it registers 145°F for slightly pink meat, about 2 to 3 minutes longer.
Transfer chops to a platter and let stand for 5 minutes before serving.
Serve chops with peach relish.

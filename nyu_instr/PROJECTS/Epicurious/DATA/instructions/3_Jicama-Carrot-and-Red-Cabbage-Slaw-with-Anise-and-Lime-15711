In a dry heavy skillet toast anise seeds over moderate heat, shaking skillet occasionally, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Cool seeds and coarsely grind with a mortar and pestle or a cleaned electric coffee/spice grinder.
Peel jícama and carrots and quarter jícama. Using a mandoline or other manual slicer, cut jícama and carrots into very thin slices, about 1/16 inch. Stack slices and cut into julienne strips. With a knife cut cabbage into very thin shreds. Vegetables may be prepared 1 day ahead and chilled separately in sealable plastic bags.
Coarsely chop parsley. In a large bowl stir together anise, oil, lime juice, mustard, and salt. Add vegetables and parsley, tossing to coat, and season with salt and pepper. Slaw may be made 2 hours ahead and chilled, covered.

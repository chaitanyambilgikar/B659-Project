In a 7- to 8-inch flameproof skillet cook bacon over moderate heat until crisp and spoon off all but 1 tablespoon fat. Add onion and cook, stirring, until softened. Stir in tomatoes, molasses, Worcestershire sauce, red pepper flakes, beans, and salt to taste and simmer until liquid is thickened, about 5 minutes.
Preheat broiler.
In a small bowl stir together oil and mustard and add crumbs, tossing to combine ingredients well. Sprinkle crumbs over beans and broil about 4 inches from heat until topping is crisp and golden, 1 to 2 minutes.

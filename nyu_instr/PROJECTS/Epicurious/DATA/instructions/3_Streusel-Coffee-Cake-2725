Preheat oven to 350°F. Grease two 9x5x3-inch loaf pans. Combine first 3 ingredients in small bowl. Cut in 1/4 cup chilled butter using fingers or pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse meal. Set streusel mixture aside.
Sift flour, baking powder, baking soda and nutmeg into large bowl. Using electronic mixer, cream 3/4 cup butter and 1 1/3 cups sugar together in another large bowl until fluffy. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Mix in vanilla. Fold in dry ingredients alternately with plain yogurt, beginning and ending with dry ingredients. Pour about 1 1/2 cups batter into bottom of each prepared pan. Sprinkle 1/3 cup streusel over each. Sprinkle 1/4 of apple over each. Divide remaining batter, streusel and apple between pans, beginning with batter. Run small sharp knife through batter to create swirl. Bake until golden brown and toothpick inserted into centers comes out clean, about 55 minutes. Cool on rack. Serve warm or at room temperature.

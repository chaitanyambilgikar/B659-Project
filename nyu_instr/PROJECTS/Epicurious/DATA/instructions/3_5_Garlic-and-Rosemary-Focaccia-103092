Combine garlic and oil in a very small metal bowl and set on a baking sheet. Bake in lower third of oven 1 hour. Cool on a rack 30 minutes. Pour oil through a small sieve into another bowl and discard garlic. Whisk together yeast and warm water in bowl of a standing electric mixer and let stand 5 minutes, or until creamy.
Stir 1/3 cup garlic oil into yeast mixture. Whisk together 7 cups flour and table salt and stir half of flour into yeast mixture. Fit mixer with dough-hook attachment. Add remaining flour and mix on low speed 3 minutes, or until dough pulls away from side of bowl, adding more flour if necessary. Knead dough with dough hook on medium-high speed, scraping down hook and side of bowl as needed, 5 minutes, or until dough is soft and slightly sticky. Transfer dough to a large oiled bowl, turning with floured hands to coat with oil. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let dough rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. Preheat oven to 450°F.

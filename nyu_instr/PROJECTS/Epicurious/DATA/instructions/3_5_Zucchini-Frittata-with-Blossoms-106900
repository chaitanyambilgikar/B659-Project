Whisk together whole eggs, whites, milk, ricotta salata, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a large bowl.
Preheat broiler.
Cook zucchini in oil in a 12-inch ovenproof nonstick skillet (or wrap plastic handle in a double layer of foil) over moderate heat, stirring, until just tender, about 8 minutes. Add garlic, oregano, remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Pour egg mixture over zucchini and cook over moderately high heat, lifting up cooked egg around edges to let uncooked egg flow underneath, 3 to 5 minutes (top will still be moist).
Sprinkle top with Parmigiano-Reggiano and arrange blossoms (if using) evenly on top, pressing them in lightly.
Broil frittata 6 inches from heat until set, puffed, and golden brown, about 3 minutes.
Cool 5 minutes, then loosen edges with a spatula and slide onto a platter. Cut into wedges and serve warm or at room temperature.

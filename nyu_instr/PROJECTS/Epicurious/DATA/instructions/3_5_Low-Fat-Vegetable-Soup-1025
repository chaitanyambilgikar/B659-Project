Combine zucchini, carrots, mushrooms, onion and potato in heavy large Dutch oven. Add vegetable broth, crushed tomatoes, stewed tomatoes, 3 tablespoons parsley, cilantro, garlic, basil and oregano. Bring mixture to boil. Reduce heat, cover and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes.
Strain cooking liquid into large saucepan; reserve vegetables. Place 3 cups vegetables in blender. Add 1/4 cup cooking liquid. Puree until smooth. Stir puree into remaining cooking liquid in saucepan. Return remaining vegetables to cooking liquid. Season to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 5 days ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
Bring soup to simmer. Ladle into bowls. Sprinkle with additional parsley.

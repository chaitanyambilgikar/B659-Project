Preheat oven to 400°F with rack in lowest position.
Toss shallots with 1 1/2 tablespoon oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a 13-by 9-inch baking pan, spreading evenly.
Roast, stirring occasionally, until shallots are golden, about 30 minutes.
Toss potatoes with remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a bowl, then add to shallots.
Roast, turning occasionally, until vegetables are tender and potatoes are crusty, 40 to 50 minutes.

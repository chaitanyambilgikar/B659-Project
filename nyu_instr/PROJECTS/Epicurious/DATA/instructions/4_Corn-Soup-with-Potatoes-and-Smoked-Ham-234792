Melt lard in heavy large pot over high heat. Add ham steak, onion, both bell peppers, and garlic; sauté until vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes. Add corn and stir 5 minutes. Add ham hock and potato, then 5 cups water; bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer partially covered 1 hour. Remove ham hock. Season soup to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cool slightly. Chill uncovered until cold, then cover and keep chilled. Rewarm over medium heat before serving.)

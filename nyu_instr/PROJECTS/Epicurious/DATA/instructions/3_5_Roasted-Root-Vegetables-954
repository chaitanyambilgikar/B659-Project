Preheat oven to 425°F. Combine all vegetables in large bowl. Add oil; toss to coat thoroughly. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 2 hours ahead. Cover and let stand at room temperature.) Arrange vegetables on 2 heavy large baking sheets.
Roast vegetables until tender and beginning to turn golden brown, stirring occasionally, about 50 minutes. Transfer to large bowl and serve.

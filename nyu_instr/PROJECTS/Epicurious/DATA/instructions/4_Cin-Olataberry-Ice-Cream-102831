Combine the milk, cream, cinnamon (ground and stick), and 1 tablespoon of the sugar in a saucepan and scald. Whisk the yolks with the remaining sugar and the cr&ème de cassis until light and fluffy. Slowly add the hot milk mixture with gentle whisking to the eggs to warm them. Pour the entire mixture back into the saucepan and add the olallieberries.
Cook over low heat for about 20 minutes until the custard thickens and coats the back of a wooden spoon. Cool to room temperature.
Freeze in an ice cream maker. When the ice cream has thickened, remove the canister from the ice and salt, then remove the dasher and pat down the ice cream with a rubber scraper to remove excess air. Cover the surface with plastic wrap to prevent ice crystal formation. Replace the canister lid and place in a freezer to harden for 3-5 hours.

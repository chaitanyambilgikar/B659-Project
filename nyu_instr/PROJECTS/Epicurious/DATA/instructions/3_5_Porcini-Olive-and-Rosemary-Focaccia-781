Add enough hot water to porcini soaking liquid to measure 3/4 cup if necessary. Heat liquid in small saucepan to 105°F to 115°F. Pour into processor. Sprinkle yeast over. Let stand until yeast dissolves, about 12 minutes. Add oil, 1 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon rosemary. Process 3 seconds. Add 2 cups plus 2 tablespoons flour and process until moist clumps form, adding more flour if necessary. Mix in olives, using 4 on/off turns. Turn out dough into large bowl. Add porcini and knead until mixed in (dough will be firm and sticky).
Generously flour heavy large baking sheet. Turn out dough onto sheet. Using floured hands, press out dough to irregular 13 x 9-inch rectangle. Sprinkle dough with remaining 1 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon rosemary. Cover baking sheet with plastic wrap. Let dough rise in warm draft-free area until puffy, about 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 400°F. Bake bread until crusty, about 25 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.
To reconstitute the dried porcini mushrooms: Combine porcini and water in medium bowl. Let stand until porcini soften, about 40 minutes. Pour mixture into strainer set over small bowl. Press porcini to release excess liquid. Coarsely chop porcini. Pour soaking liquid into measuring cup, leaving any sediment behind; reserve soaking liquid.

Combine cumin, coriander, garlic, and 1 tablespoon oil. Pat pork chops dry and season with salt and pepper. Rub spice mixture on both sides of chops.
Heat remaining tablespoon oil in a large heavy skillet over moderate heat until hot but not smoking, then cook chops until just cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes on each side.
Serve pork chops sprinkled with cilantro and garnish with lime wedges.

For caramel: Combine sugar, 1/2 cup water, and lemon juice in heavy medium saucepan. Stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat; boil without stirring until mixture is very dark amber (but not burned), occasionally swirling pan and brushing down sides with wet pastry brush, about 10 minutes (time will vary depending on size of pan). Remove from heat; add cream (mixture will bubble vigorously). Return to medium heat and stir until any caramel bits dissolve and mixture is slightly thickened, about 4 minutes. Stir in fleur de sel. Cool.
For custard: Whisk egg yolks and sugar to blend in large bowl. Bring milk, cream, and corn syrup to simmer in heavy large saucepan. Gradually whisk hot milk mixture into yolk mixture. Return mixture to saucepan. Stir over medium-low heat until slightly thickened and instant-read thermometer inserted into custard registers 175°F, about 14 minutes. Strain custard. Stir in lemon juice, vanilla, and fleur de sel.
Whisk caramel into custard. Refrigerate until cold, about 4 hours. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and keep chilled.)
Process custard in ice cream maker according to manufacturer's instructions. Transfer ice cream to container; cover and freeze until firm, about 4 hours. (Can be made 1 week ahead. Keep frozen.)

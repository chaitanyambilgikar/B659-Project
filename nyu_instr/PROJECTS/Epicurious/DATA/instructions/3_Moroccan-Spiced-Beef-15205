Prepare grill.
In a shallow bowl stir together all ingredients except steaks. Add steaks and rub with spice mixture. Let steaks stand, covered, at room temperature 15 minutes.
Grill steaks on an oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals about 3 minutes on each side for medium-rare. (Alternatively, broil steaks under a preheated broiler 3 to 4 inches from heat.)
Serve steaks with chutney.

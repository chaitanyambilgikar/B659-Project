Preheat oven to 350°F.
In a 10- to 12-inch skillet cook celery in oil over moderate heat, stirring, until softened. Add garlic and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add tomatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes.
Remove skillet from heat and stir in beans. Mash about one fourth of beans with back of a large spoon and stir in remaining ingredients except topping. Season mixture with salt and pepper. Transfer bean mixture to a 2- to 2 1/2-quart gratin dish or other shallow baking dish and smooth top with a rubber spatula. Gratin may be prepared up to this point 4 hours ahead and chilled, covered.
Make persillade topping: In a small bowl with a fork stir together topping ingredients until crumbs are evenly moistened.
Sprinkle topping over bean mixture and bake in middle of oven 45 minutes, or until bubbling and top is golden brown. Cool gratin 5 minutes before serving.

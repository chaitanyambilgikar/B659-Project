Heat oil in heavy large pot or Dutch oven over high heat. Add lamb bones; sauté until dark brown, about 10 minutes. Add remaining ingredients. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium; simmer until lamb, barley and all vegetables are tender and soup is thick, stirring occasionally, about 1 hour 30 minutes. Remove bay leaves. Season with salt and pepper.

Brown the onions, green pepper, and garlic. Add the meat and brown. Add the Mexicorn, tomato sauce, wine, chili powder, salt, pepper and simmer for 15 or 20 minutes. Place mixture in a casserole dish.
Make the topping with the cornbread mix, 1 cup of cream-style corn, 1/2 cup cheese, and milk to make runny. (Sometimes I add an egg.) Pour over the casserole and bake at 400°F for 35-45 minutes.
10 minutes before serving, sprinkle top with crushed Fritos and add the remaining cup of cheddar cheese. Garnish with sliced black olives.

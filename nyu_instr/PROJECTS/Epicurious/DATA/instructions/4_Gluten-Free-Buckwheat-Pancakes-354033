In a large mixing bowl, mix together all flours and the flax seeds, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt. Create a well in the center and add the remaining wet ingredients. Use a fork to mix wellfor about a minute. Let the batter rest for about 10 minutes and preheat a large, heavy-bottomed, nonstick pan, preferably cast iron, over medium-high heat.
When pan is hot, spray with a thin layer of cooking spray and use an ice cream scooper to pour batter and form pancakes. I usually make two at a time, but do as many as you can fi t. The pancake should start to form little air bubbles, but not as much as "normal" pancakes do, so don’t worry. Cook on one side for 2 1/2 to 3 minutes, then flip and cook for 2 minutes more.

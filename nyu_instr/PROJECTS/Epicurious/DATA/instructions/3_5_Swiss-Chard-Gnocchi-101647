Steam potatoes until very tender, about 50 minutes. Cool potatoes slightly, then peel. Mash potatoes in large bowl until smooth. Mix in salt and pepper. Meanwhile, bring 2 inches of salted water to boil in large pot. Add chard and cook until wilted, stirring occasionally, about 3 minutes. Drain chard; cool. Squeeze out as much excess liquid as possible. Finely chop chard in processor.
Mix chard into potato mixture. Stir in egg and oil. Gradually mix in enough flour to form soft, slightly sticky dough.
Dust baking sheet with flour. Working in batches and using floured hands, roll 1/4 cup dough on lightly floured work surface to form 12-inch-long rope. Cut rope into 1-inch pieces. Roll each piece between palms to form oval ball. Using whisk, gently roll each ball down length of wires, making ribbed impressions in gnocchi. Transfer gnocchi to prepared baking sheet. Repeat rolling, cutting and shaping with remaining dough.
Working in batches, cook gnocchi in large pot of boiling salted water until gnocchi rise to surface and are tender, about 6 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer gnocchi to large bowl. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Place gnocchi in single layer on oiled baking sheet. Cover with plastic; chill.)
Melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add gnocchi and sauté until coated with butter and heated through, about 3 minutes. Meanwhile, bring sauce to simmer in heavy medium saucepan, stirring occasionally. Ladle sauce onto plates.
Spoon gnocchi atop sauce. Sprinkle with cheese and serve.

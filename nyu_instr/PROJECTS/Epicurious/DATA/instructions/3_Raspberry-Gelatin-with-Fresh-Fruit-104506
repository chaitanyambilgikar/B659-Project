Puree thawed raspberries in syrup in processor. Pour raspberry mixture into strainer set over medium bowl, pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard solids in strainer.
Pour grape juice into medium saucepan. Sprinkle gelatin over; let stand until softened, about 10 minutes. Stir over low heat just until warm and gelatin dissolves, about 1 minute. Remove from heat. Add strained raspberry mixture and lemon juice; whisk until blended. Stir in grapes and orange pieces. Divide mixture among eight 3/4-cup custard cups or ramekins. Chill until gelatin is set, at least 6 hours or overnight.
Run small knife between gelatin and custard cups to loosen. Place small plate atop each custard cup; holding plate and custard cup firmly together, invert and gently shake to allow gelatin to settle onto plate. Garnish with fresh mint sprigs, if desired. Serve.

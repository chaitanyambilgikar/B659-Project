1. Prepare the tuna: In a shallow bowl, combine the olive oil, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Add the tuna, coat well and let rest for 15 minutes, turning once.
2. Prepare the salsa: In a separate bowl, combine all the remaining ingredients except the chopped cilantro. Refrigerate, covered, for up to 1 hour.
3. Shortly before serving, sear the tuna in a nonstick skillet over medium heat for 4 to 5 minutes on the first side, adding any remaining marinade or extra oil, if necessary. Turn the fish and sear for 3 minutes on the second side, for medium-rare. With a spatula, remove the tuna steaks to the center of 4 dinner plates.
4. Divide the salsa (with the juices) equally atop the tuna. Garnish with chopped cilantro.

1. Put coconut, yogurt, coriander leaves, chilies, salt, and hot water into the container of an electric blender, and blend until finely pureed. Put into a small serving bowl.
2. Heat the ghee or oil over medium-high heat in a small frying pan. When it is very hot, carefully add mustard seeds. Keep a pot lid or splatter screen handy, since the seeds may splutter and splatter. When the seeds stop spluttering and turn gray, immediately pour the ghee and seeds over the coconut puree. Mix thoroughly, check for salt, and serve.
Note: This relish may be prepared ahead and refrigerated for up to 2 days. Remove from refrigerator at least 15 minutes before serving.

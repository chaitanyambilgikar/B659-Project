Combine chicken, tequila and lime juice in small shallow dish. Cover and marinate at least 30 minutes and up to 2 hours, turning occasionally.
Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat) or preheat broiler. Drain chicken; reserve marinade. Season chicken with salt and pepper. Grill or broil until just cooked through, occasionally basting chicken with some reserved marinade, about 4 minutes per side. Boil remaining marinade in small saucepan 1 minute.
Cut each chicken breast crosswise into thin slices. Arrange slices on platter. Garnish with lime wedges. Serve, passing marinade separately as sauce.

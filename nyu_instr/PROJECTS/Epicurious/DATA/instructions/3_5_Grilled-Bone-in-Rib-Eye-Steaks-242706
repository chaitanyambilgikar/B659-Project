Prepare barbecue (high heat). If using gas grill, leave opposite side unlit; if using charcoal grill, keep opposite side free of coals. Brush steaks with olive oil, then sprinkle both sides with cracked black pepper and smoked salt.
Grill steaks on hot side of barbecue until grill marks form, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer steaks to unlit side of grill, cover, and cook to desired doneness, about 8 minutes for medium-rare. Transfer steaks to plates; let rest 10 to 15 minutes. Serve Blue Cheese-Crusted Tomatoes alongside.

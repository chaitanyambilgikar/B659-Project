In a small saucepan bring the cream just to a boil, remove the pan from the heat, and whisk in the chocolate, whisking the mixture until the chocolate is melted completely. Whisk in the rum, whisking until the mixture is smooth, and stir in the marrons glacés. Chill the mixture, covered, for 3 hours, or until it is firm. Form the mixture by heaping teaspoons into balls and roll the balls in the cocoa powder. Chill the truffles on a baking sheet lined with wax paper for 1 hour, or until they are firm. The truffles keep in an airtight container, chilled, for 2 weeks.

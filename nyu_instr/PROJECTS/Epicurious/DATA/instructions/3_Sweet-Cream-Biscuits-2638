Preheat oven to 450°F. Sift flour, sugar, baking powder and salt into large bowl. Using pastry blender or fingertips, cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add whipping cream to dry ingredients and stir until just combined; do not overmix. Turn out onto lightly floured surface and knead just until dough forms. Pat out dough to 1/4-inch thickness. Cut out rounds using floured 3/4- to 1-inch-diameter cutter. Gather dough scraps and pat out to 1/4-inch thickness. Cut out additional rounds. Repeat gathering, patting out and cutting out dough rounds until all dough is used. Transfer rounds to ungreased baking sheets. Bake until golden brown, about 10 minutes.

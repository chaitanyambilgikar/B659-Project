Insert a 10-inch bamboo skewer at the tail end of each shrimp and thread the shrimp onto it. Brush the shrimp with the barbecue sauce and arrange them on a large platter. Just before grilling brush the shrimp again with the sauce, grill them on a rack set over glowing coals for 1 minute on each side, or until they are pink and springy to the touch, and serve them warm or at room temperature.

Cook spinach in hot bouillon for 10 minutes. Drain, reserving the liquid. Melt butter and stir in flower. When blended and smooth, add hot liquid, a little at a time, stirring until smooth. Cover and simmer 5 minutes. Add spinach, salt, pepper and nutmeg and mix thoroughly. Simmer covered for 5 minutes. Serve with hard-cooked egg slices floating on top of each bowl of soup.

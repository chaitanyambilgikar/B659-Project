In a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water melt the chocolate and the butter, stirring until the mixture is smooth, and let the mixture cool. Beat in the egg, the brown sugar,and the vanilla and stir in the flour, the cinnamon,and the salt. Divide the mixture into 16 mounds, abut 3 inches apart, on buttered baking sheets and bake the brownies in the middle of a preheated 350°F oven for 8 to 10 minutes, or until they are just firm. (They will flatten into disks.) transfer the brownies with a spatula to racks to cool and freeze them for 30 minutes, or until they are very firm.
Divide the ice cream, softened, among the flat sides of 8 of the brownies, spreading it smooth, and top the ice cream with the remaining brownies, flat sides down. Freeze the ice-cream sandwiches, covered, for at least 1 hour or overnight. Serve the ice-cream sandwiches drizzled with the caramel sauce.

Set oven racks in upper and lower thirds of oven and preheat oven to 350°F. Brush molds with some melted butter.
Sift together flour, baking powder, and salt.
Beat eggs in a large bowl with an electric mixer at high speed until light and foamy, about 30 seconds with a standing mixer or 1 minute with a handheld, then beat in vanilla. Gradually add granulated sugar, beating constantly at high speed, and continue to beat until mixture is tripled in volume, about 3 minutes with standing mixer or 5 minutes with handheld.
Sift flour mixture in 3 or 4 batches over egg, folding in each batch until just combined. Then fold in zest and 3/4 cup melted butter.
Spoon a rounded tablespoon of batter into each mold (they will be about two-thirds full) and bake in upper and lower thirds of oven (2 pans will fit on 1 rack), switching position of pans halfway through baking, until golden around edges and a tester inserted in centers comes out clean, 10 to 12 minutes total.
Invert madeleines onto a rack and dust scalloped sides with confectioners sugar.

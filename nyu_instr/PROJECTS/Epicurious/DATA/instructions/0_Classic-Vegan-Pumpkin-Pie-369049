1. Preheat the oven to 350° F.
2. Combine the prebaked pumpkin or squash pulp in a food processor with the next 4 ingredients and process until velvety smooth. If you have a small or medium-size processor, you may need to do this with half the ingredients at a time.
3. Pour the filling into the crust. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until the mixture is set and the crust is golden. Let the pies cool to room temperature. Cut into 6 or 8 wedges to serve.

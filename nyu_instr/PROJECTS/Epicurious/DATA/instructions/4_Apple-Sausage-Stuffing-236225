Place pork tenderloin and pork fat on baking sheet. Freeze 20 minutes. Quickly cut meat and fat into 1-inch cubes. Pass cubes through meat grinder fitted with fine blade (or have butcher grind meat and fat together twice). Transfer mixture to large bowl. Add salt, thyme, sage, nutmeg, pepper, and allspice and mix well. Blend in Cognac. Cover and chill overnight.
Preheat oven to 300°F. Spread French bread on 2 large baking sheets. Bake until brown and dry, stirring frequently, 20 to 30 minutes. Let cool. Transfer to large mixing bowl.
Melt 2 tablespoons butter in large skillet over medium-high heat. Add sausage and cook until no longer pink, 5 to 7 minutes, stirring and pressing with fork occasionally to break up lumps. Add sausage to bread using slotted spoon. Discard fat from skillet.
Melt remaining butter in same skillet over low heat. Add apple, onion, and celery and cook until vegetables begin to soften, 5 to 7 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in parsley and cook 2 to 3 more minutes. Add mixture to bread and toss gently. Blend in remaining ingredients. Taste and adjust seasoning. Cool completely.
If serving stuffing separately (without turkey), cover and bake 1 hour in 325°F oven.

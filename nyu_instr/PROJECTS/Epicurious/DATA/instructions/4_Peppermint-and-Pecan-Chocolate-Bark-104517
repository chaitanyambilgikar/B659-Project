Preheat oven to 250°F. Line 17x11-inch rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Sprinkle chopped chocolate evenly on parchment-lined sheet. Place in oven just until chocolate is softened, about 5 minutes. Remove from oven. Using rubber spatula or back of spoon, spread chocolate evenly on sheet to edges. Immediately sprinkle peppermint candies and pecans over chocolate. Refrigerate until chocolate is firm, about 2 hours. Cut chocolate bark into irregular bite-size pieces. (Can be made 2 weeks ahead. Store between sheets of foil in airtight containers in refrigerator.)

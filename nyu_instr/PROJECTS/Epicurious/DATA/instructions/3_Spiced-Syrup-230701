Stir all ingredients in heavy large deep saucepan over medium-low heat until sugar dissolves. Attach candy thermometer to side of pan (do not allow tip to touch bottom). Increase heat to high. Boil without stirring until thermometer registers 220°F, occasionally swirling pan and brushing down sides with wet pastry brush, about 12 minutes (time will vary depending on size of pan). Strain syrup into medium bowl. Cool to room temperature. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Let stand at room temperature. Rewarm before serving.)

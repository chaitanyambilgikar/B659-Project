In a small saucepan bring the cream to a boil, remove the pan from the heat, and add the chocolate, stirring until it is melted completely. Add the butter, stir the mixture until it is smooth, and stir in the brandy and 1/4 cup of the pecans. Transfer the mixture to a bowl and chill it, covered, for 4 hours, or until it is firm. Form the mixture by teaspoons into balls and roll the balls in the remaining 1/2 cup pecans. Chill the truffles in a baking pan for 1 hour, or until they are firm. The truffles keep in an airtight container, covered and chilled.

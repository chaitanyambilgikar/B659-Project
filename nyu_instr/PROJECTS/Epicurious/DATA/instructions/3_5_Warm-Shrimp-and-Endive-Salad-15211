Peel and seed tomato and cut into 1/4-inch dice. In a dry small heavy skillet toast sesame seeds over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 3 minutes. Shell and devein shrimp.
Trim top 1 1/4 inches from each endive and separate leaves, discarding small inner core. With a sharp knife cut away soft yellow edges of each leaf (save trimmings for another use), leaving only firm white centers, and cut centers lengthwise into 1/4-inch-wide strips.
In a small bowl whisk together vinaigrette and mustards. In a bowl combine endives, tomato, sesame seeds, soy sauce, lemon juice, and 3 tablespoons mustard vinaigrette, tossing to coat, and season with sea salt and white pepper.
Season shrimp with sea salt and white pepper. In a large heavy nonstick skillet heat oil over moderately high heat until just smoking. Add shrimp in one layer and sauté until undersides are golden brown, about 1 minute. Turn shrimp over and sauté until just cooked through, about 30 seconds.
Divide shrimp among 4 plates, mounding them. Add 5 teaspoons sliced cilantro to endive mixture, tossing to mix, and mound mixture over shrimp. Garnish salads with remaining teaspoon cilantro.

Preheat oven to 425°F with rack in middle. Butter muffin cups.
Whisk together cornmeal, baking soda, and salt in a bowl. Whisk buttermilk into eggs, then add to cornmeal mixture and whisk vigorously until smooth. Whisk in butter.
Divide batter among muffin cups and bake until edges begin to pull away from sides and a wooden pick inserted in center of a muffin comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Turn out onto a rack and serve warm.

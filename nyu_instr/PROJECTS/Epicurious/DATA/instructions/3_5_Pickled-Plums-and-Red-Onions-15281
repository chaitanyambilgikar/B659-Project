Pit plums and cut into 1/2-inch wedges. Cut onions into 3/4-inch pieces and transfer with plums to a 10-cup (2 1/2-quart) heatproof glass jar with a lid. In a large saucepan bring water and vinegar to a boil with remaining ingredients, stirring until sugar is dissolved, and immediately pour over plums and onions. Cool mixture, uncovered. Plums and onions may be pickled 1 week ahead and chilled, covered.

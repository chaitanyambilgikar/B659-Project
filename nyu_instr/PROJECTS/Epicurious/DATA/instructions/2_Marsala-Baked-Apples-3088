Boil cider and Marsala in heavy medium saucepan until reduced to 1 cup, about 20 minutes. (Syrup can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
Preheat oven to 350°F. Peel top quarter of each apple. Core apples without cutting through bottom. Place apples in 8x8x2-inch glass baking dish. Spoon 1 tablespoon brown sugar, then 1 tablespoon raisins into each apple.
Stir 2 tablespoons brown sugar into syrup. Pour syrup over and around apples. Sprinkle nutmeg over. Place 1/2 tablespoon raisins into each apple.
Bake apples until butter melts, about 5 minutes. Cover dish with foil and bake 30 minutes. Uncover and continue baking until apples are tender, basting frequently with juices, about 25 minutes longer.
Serve apples hot or warm in shallow bowls with ice cream and biscotti.

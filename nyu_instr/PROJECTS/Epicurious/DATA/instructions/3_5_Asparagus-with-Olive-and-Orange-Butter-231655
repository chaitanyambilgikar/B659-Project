Cut asparagus into 2-inch-long pieces and cook in a wide 4-quart pot of boiling salted water , uncovered, until just crisp-tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain in a colander.
Melt butter in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat, then whisk in juice and olive paste (to taste) until blended. Add asparagus and salt and pepper to taste, tossing to coat.

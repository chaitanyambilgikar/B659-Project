Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally. Drain.
Meanwhile, sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper. Heat reserved oil from anchovies in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and chopped anchovies; sauté until chicken is no longer pink, about 3 minutes. Add garlic and sauté 1 minute. Add tomatoes, olives, capers, and dried crushed red pepper. Simmer over medium heat until slightly thickened, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Add parsley and drained pasta; stir to coat. Season with salt and pepper.

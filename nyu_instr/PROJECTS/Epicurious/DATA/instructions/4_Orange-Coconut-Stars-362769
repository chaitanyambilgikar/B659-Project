Heat oven to 350°F. Cut dough in half; roll out both halves to an even 1/4-inch thickness. Cut out cookies with a 2-inch star cookie cutter; reroll scraps to get 40 cookies. Coat 2 cookie sheets with cooking spray; place cookies on sheets 1 inch apart and bake 1 batch at a time until firm and slightly golden at edges, 4 to 5 minutes. Cool on wire racks. Line baking sheet with foil; spread coconut on foil. Bake, stirring once or twice, until golden, 3 to 4 minutes. Spread coconut on sheet of wax paper; crush with fingers. Whisk sugar, zest and juice in a bowl until combined. Dip 1 side of cookie into orange glaze, then press into coconut; let set on wire racks.

In a measuring cup whisk together lime juice, marmalade, garlic paste, coriander, 3 tablespoons oil, soy sauce, red pepper flakes, and salt and pepper to taste and reserve 1/3 cup mixture in a small bowl or ramekin for dipping. In a large sealable plastic bag combine shrimp with remaining mixture and marinate, chilled, tossing occasionally to coat shrimp, 45 minutes.
Drain shrimp and lightly pat dry between paper towels. In a large non-stick skillet pat 1 1/2 teaspoons oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and sauté half of shrimp until golden brown and cooked through, about 1 1/2 minutes on each side. Sauté remaining shrimp in remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons oil in same manner.
Garnish shrimp with coriander sprigs and serve with reserved dipping sauce.

Place gelatin in large bowl. Drain pineapple thoroughly in sieve set over large measuring cup. Add enough additional pineapple juice to juice in cup to measure 1 1/2 cups. Transfer juice to small saucepan and bring to boil. Pour boiling juice over gelatin. Stir until gelatin dissolves. Mix in drained pineapple, water, lemon juice and lemon peel. Refrigerate until mixture thickens and just begins to set, stirring occasionally, about 1 hour.
Beat cream and vanilla in another large bowl until stiff peaks form. Fold into gelatin mixture in 2 additions.
Transfer mousse to serving bowl or spoon into goblets. Cover and refrigerate until well chilled, at least 4 hours. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Keep refrigerated.)

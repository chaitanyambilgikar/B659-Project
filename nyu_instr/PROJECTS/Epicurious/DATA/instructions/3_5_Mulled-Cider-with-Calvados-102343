In a saucepan stir together the cider, the brown sugar, the allspice, the nutmeg, the cloves, the cinnamon pieces, and the apple, simmer the mixture, covered, for 10 minutes, and stir in the Calvados. Heat the mixture over moderate heat until it is hot and discard the allspice, the cloves, and the cinnamon. Divide the mulled cider among heated mugs and garnish each drink with a few of the apple slices.

Trim leeks and discard most of dark-green parts. Cut leeks in half lengthwise and wash well, keeping halves intact. Steam leeks 15 minutes, or until tender. Arrange leeks, cut sides up, on a buttered baking sheet.
Preheat broiler.
In a small saucepan melt butter and stir in bread crumbs and salt and pepper to taste. Spoon bread crumb mixture onto leeks, patting down mixture with back of spoon to help adhere. Broil leeks 2 to 3 inches from heat until bread crumbs are golden brown, about 3 minutes.

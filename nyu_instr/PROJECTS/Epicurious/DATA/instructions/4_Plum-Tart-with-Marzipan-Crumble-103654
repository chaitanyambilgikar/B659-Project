For crust: Blend first four ingredients in processor until nuts are finely ground. Add butter; process until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add cream and yolk. Blend, using on/off turns, until dough comes together. Press over bottom and up sides of 11-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom. Pierce all over with fork. Chill at least 2 hours and up to 1 day.
Preheat oven to 400°F. Bake crust until golden, pressing with back of fork every 5 minutes if crust bubbles, about 25 minutes. Transfer crust to rack; cool. Reduce oven temperature to 375°F.
Blend flour, almond paste and sugar in processor until almond paste is finely ground. Add butter and blend, using on/off turns, until coarse crumbs form. Transfer crumble to bowl; mix in almonds.
Combine all ingredients in medium bowl; toss to blend well.
Sprinkle 3/4 cup crumble over cooled crust. Top with plums. Sprinkle with remaining crumble.
Bake tart until filling bubbles thickly and top is golden, about 40 minutes. Cool 10 minutes. Push up pan bottom to release tart. Cool. (Can be made 8 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.)

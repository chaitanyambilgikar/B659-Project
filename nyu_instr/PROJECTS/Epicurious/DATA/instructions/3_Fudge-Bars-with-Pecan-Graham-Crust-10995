Make crust: Preheat oven to 350°F.
Into a food processor crumble graham crackers and grind into crumbs. Add pecans, sugar, butter, and salt and pulse motor until nuts are chopped fine. Press crumb mixture evenly onto bottom of an 11- by 7-inch baking pan and bake in middle of oven 5 minutes. Cool crust in pan on a rack.
Make fudge layer: In a medium metal bowl set over a saucepan of barley simmering water melt chocolate with butter, stirring. Remove bowl from pan and cool to room temperature. With an electric mixer beat in remaining ingredients, beating until smooth.
Spread fudge layer on top of crust and bake in middle of oven 30 to 35 minutes, or until top is set, edges have begun to pull away from sides of pan, and a tester inserted in center comes out with moist chocolate adhering. While fudge is still hot, score with a sharp knife into 24 small bars and cut into bars, wiping knife blade clean after each cut. Cool bars in pans on a rack. Bars will continue to set as they cool but will remain somewhat soft. Bars keep in an airtight container 3 days or, covered and chilled, 1 week.

Pour stock into a saucepan, cover, and bring to a simmer. Heat pan drippings in the same skillet used to fry the chicken. Add flour to drippings and blend. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, for 1 to 2 minutes. Add stock to skillet; cook and stir until mixture thickens. Stir in cream, chicken base, and pepper. Simmer until desired consistency is reached. Strain into a serving bowl.

Preheat broiler.
Arrange bell peppers, cut sides down, in a shallow baking pan.
Broil 4 to 5 inches from heat until blackened and beginning to soften, about 15 minutes.
Cover pan tightly with foil and let stand, covered, until cool enough to handle, 10 to 15 minutes. 3Peel peppers and cut lengthwise into 1/2-inch-wide strips.
Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 400°F. Lightly oil gratin dish.
Stir together parsley, thyme, rosemary, zest, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Toss bread cubes with cheese and oil (5 tablespoons) in another bowl.
Arrange half of tomatoes in gratin dish, overlapping slices and alternating colors, then spread half of pepper strips on top. Sprinkle with half of herb mixture and 2 cups bread mixture. Repeat layering with remaining ingredients, ending with bread mixture.
Bake gratin until vegetables are bubbling and topping is golden brown, 35 to 45 minutes, covering dish with foil if bread browns too quickly.
Cool gratin on a rack to warm or room temperature.

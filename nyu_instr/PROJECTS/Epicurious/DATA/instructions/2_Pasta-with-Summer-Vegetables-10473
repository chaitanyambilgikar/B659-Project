In a saucepan of boiling water boil the fava beans for 4 to 5 minutes, or until they are tender. Drain the beans, let them cool until they can be handled, and peel off and discard the tough outer skins. In a steamer set over boiling water steam the zucchini, covered, for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, or until it is just tender. In a large bowl combine the beans, the zucchini, the tomatoes, the onion, drained well if soaked, the garlic, the bell pepper, the parsley, the oil, and salt and black pepper to taste and toss the mixture until it is combined well. In a kettle of boiling salted water boil the gemellini until it is al dente, drain it, and while it is still hot add it to the vegetable mixture, tossing the mixture until it is combined well. Serve the pasta warm or at room temperature with the Parmesan.

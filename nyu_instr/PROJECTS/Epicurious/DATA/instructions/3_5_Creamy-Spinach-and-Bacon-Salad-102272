Cook bacon until crisp and drain on paper towels.
While bacon is cooking, mince garlic and mash to a paste with a pinch salt. Whisk together oil, sour cream, lemon juice, sugar, and garlic paste in a large bowl and season with salt and pepper. Add spinach and crumble bacon over it. Toss with cheese and dressing.

In a bowl whisk together the garlic, the sugar, the anchovy paste, the lime juice, the jalapeños, and salt and pepper to taste. On each skewer thread alternately 4 pieces of the sausage and 4 pieces of the eggplant, arrange the kebabs in one layer in a shallow dish, and pour the jalapeño mixture over them. Let the kebabs marinate, covered and chilled, for 2 hours or overnight. Broil the kebabs on the oiled rack of a foil-lined broiler pan under a preheated broiler about 4 inches from the heat, turning them once, for 15 minutes, or until the sausage is cooked through.

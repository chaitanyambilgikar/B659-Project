Preheat oven to 375°F. Cook bacon in heavy large skillet over medium heat 5 minutes. Add onion and saute until tender, about 5 minutes. Add cabbage and cook until all liquid evaporates and cabbage is golden brown, stirring frequently, about 16 minutes.
Combine half and half, eggs, cheese, salt and caraway; season generously with pepper. Stir in cabbage mixture. Pour into crust. Bake until filling puffs and starts to brown, about 40 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.

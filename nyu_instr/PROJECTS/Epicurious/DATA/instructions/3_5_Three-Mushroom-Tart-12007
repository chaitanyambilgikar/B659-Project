Make filling: In a 10- to 12-inch heavy skillet cook shallots in butter over moderately low heat, stirring, until softened. Add minced white and shiitake mushrooms, Worcestershire sauce, and salt and pepper to taste and cook mixture over moderately high heat, stirring occasionally, until liquid mushrooms give off is evaporated. Add vinegar and Sherry and boil until all liquid is evaporated. Transfer mixture to a bowl and cool. Whisk in cream, egg, and salt and pepper to taste. Filling may be made 2 days ahead and chilled, covered.
On a lightly floured surface roll out pastry into a 16- by 10-inch rectangle and fit it into a 13 3/4- by 4-inch tart pan with a removable fluted rim. (Alternatively, use a 9-inch round tart pan with a removable fluted rim.) Roll a rolling pin over pastry to trim it flush with top of rim. Very lightly prick bottom of shell with a fork and spread filling evenly in shell.
Preheat oven to 425°F. with a baking sheet set on lowest rack.
Make topping: Thinly slice white mushrooms. Holding a knife at a 45°F. angle, thinly slice shiitakes. Trim enoki-dake mushrooms to 2-inch lengths and arrange each type of mushroom decoratively on filling, overlapping them. Brush mushrooms gently with lemon juice.
Bake tart on heated baking sheet in oven 20 to 25 minutes, or until filling is set and pastry is golden. Transfer tart in pan to a rack and cool to warm or room temperature. Remove rim before serving.

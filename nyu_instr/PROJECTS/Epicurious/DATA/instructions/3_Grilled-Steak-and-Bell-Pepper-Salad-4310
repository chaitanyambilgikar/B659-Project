Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat) or preheat broiler. Sprinkle steak with salt and pepper. Grill about 5 minutes per side for medium-rare. Cool. Halve steak lengthwise. Slice across grain into thin strips.
Meanwhile, char peppers on barbecue, over gas flame or in broiler until blackened on all sides. Enclose in paper bag; let stand 10 minutes. Peel and seed peppers. Cut into thin strips. Halve strips crosswise.
Whisk oil, vinegar, garlic and dry mustard in large bowl to blend. Add steak, roasted peppers, watercress and onion; toss to combine. Season with salt and pepper. Chill at least 2 hours or up to 8 hours. Mix in tomatoes and serve.

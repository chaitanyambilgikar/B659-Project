Prepare gill.
In a small bowl drizzle 2 teaspoons oil over pepper rings, tossing to coat well. Secure each slice of onion horizontally with a wooden pick (to prevent separation into rings) and brush with remaining teaspoon oil.
Grill peppers and onions on an oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals 3 minutes on each side, or until tender. (Alternatively, peppers and onions may be grilled in batches in a hot well-seasoned ridged grill pan over moderately high heat.)
Transfer peppers and onions to a bowl, discarding wooden picks, and toss with Worcestershire sauce and vinegar.
Prick sausages with a fork and grill, turning them, until golden and just cooked through (about 160° F. on a instant-read thermometer), 10 to 15 minutes.
Halve sausages lengthwise and rolls horizontally and grill, cut sides down, 1 minute, or until sausages are cooked through but still juicy and rolls are toasted lightly.
Divide peppers and onions between rolls and top with sausages.

Preheat oven to 300°F. Blend flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and cayenne pepper in large bowl. Add milk, egg and vinegar to bowl and whisk to combine. Mix in corn and green onions.
Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Drop batter by scant 1/4 cupfuls into skillet. Cook cakes until brown and cooked through, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to baking sheet. Place in oven to keep warm. Repeat with remaining batter, adding more oil to skillet as needed. Serve cakes hot.

Break up tamarind with your fingers and blend with water in a blender until seeds have broken up and tamarind is dissolved. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, pressing lightly on solids.
Stir together tamarind mixture, brown sugar, cornstarch, and 1/8 teaspoon salt in a small heavy saucepan, then bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring frequently, and boil, stirring, 2 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in butter. Transfer to a bowl and quick-chill by setting in an ice bath and stirring occasionally until cold, about 20 minutes.
Beat cream until soft peaks form. Divide pudding among small glasses and top with cream and a sprinkle of chile seasoning (if using).

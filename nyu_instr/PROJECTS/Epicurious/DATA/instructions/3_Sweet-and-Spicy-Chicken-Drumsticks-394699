Bring Sriracha, rice vinegar, mirin, and jelly to a boil in a small heavy saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium; simmer, adjusting heat if necessary, until mixture is thick and reduced to 3/4 cup, about 10 minutes. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 week ahead. Cover; chill. Rewarm before using.
Place drumsticks in a large bowl and season generously with salt. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour. Preheat oven to 450°F. Whisk rice flour and cornstarch in a medium bowl. Place a wire rack on a rimmed baking sheet. Using a paper towel, pat drumsticks dry. Dredge in rice flour mixture, shaking off excess. Arrange on prepared rack.
Roast drumsticks, turning frequently, until skin is browned and crisp, 50-60 minutes. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Let cool, cover, and chill. Rewarm in a 450°F oven for 10-15 minutes before continuing.
Combine hot drumsticks and 1/4 cup sauce in a large bowl; toss to coat. Return drumsticks to rack and roast, turning once, until skin is crisp and sauce is beginning to brown, 8-9 minutes. Brush with additional sauce and serve remaining sauce alongside.

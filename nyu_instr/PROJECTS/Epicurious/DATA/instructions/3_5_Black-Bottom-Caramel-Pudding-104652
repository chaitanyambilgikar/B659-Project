Bring sugar and water to a boil in a large heavy saucepan over high heat, stirring with a fork until sugar is dissolved. Boil, without stirring, washing down sugar crystals clinging to side of pan with a pastry brush dipped in cold water, until pale golden, 4 to 5 minutes. Continue to cook, without stirring, swirling pan occasionally, until sugar turns a deep amber caramel, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat and carefully add cream in a slow stream (mixture will bubble and steam). Return to low heat and cook, whisking, until smooth.
Stir together 1/2 cup milk and cornstarch. Beat eggs, vanilla, and salt in another bowl.
Stir remaining 2 1/2 cups milk into caramel and bring to a simmer, whisking occasionally. Stir cornstarch mixture, then whisk into caramel. Bring to a boil, whisking, and simmer, whisking, 2 minutes, then remove from heat.
Whisk about 1 cup hot caramel mixture into egg mixture until well blended, then whisk egg mixture back into caramel. Continue whisking off the heat 1 minute. 3Whisk 1/2cup hot caramel pudding into chopped chocolate, stirring until smooth. Spoon chocolate pudding into 6 (8-oz) parfait glasses, then top with caramel pudding.
Chill until set, at least 3 hours.

Cook onion in oil in a 5- to 6-quart pot over moderate heat, stirring, until softened, 3 to 5 minutes.
Add wine and mussels and bring to a boil. Cover and cook, shaking pot occasionally, until mussels are opened, 4 to 5 minutes. (Discard any unopened ones.)
Transfer mussels to a platter with a slotted spoon, discarding steaming liquid.

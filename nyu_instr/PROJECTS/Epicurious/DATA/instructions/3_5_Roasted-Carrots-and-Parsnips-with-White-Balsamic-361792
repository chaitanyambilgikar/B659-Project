Preheat oven to 425°F. Combine parsnips and carrots on large rimmed baking sheet. Add oil and remaining ingredients; toss to coat. Spread in even layer on baking sheet. Roast until vegetables are tender and brown around edges, stirring occasionally, about 50 minutes to 1 hour. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Cool. Cover and chill. Let stand at room temperature 1 hour, then rewarm in 400°F oven 15 minutes.

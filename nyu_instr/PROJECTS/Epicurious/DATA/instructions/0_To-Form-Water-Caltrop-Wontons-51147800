If you are right-handed, lay a wonton wrapper in the palm of your left hand and use a table knife or bamboo spatula to press about 1 tbsp filling into the center of the wrapper.
Fold the wrapper in half so the opposite corners meet.
Smear a little more of the filling on to one corner of the triangle you have made. Using both hands, gently squeeze the edges of the dumpling as you bring the two corners together.
Lay the dry corner on to the corner that has been moistened by the filling, and press firmly together to seal the dumpling.
Place the finished dumplings on a flour-dusted plate or tray.
For an easier method, simply fold the wrapper in half over the stuffing, bringing the opposite corners together and pressing firmly all around the edges, as in the recipe method for Sichuanese Wontons in Chilli Oil Sauce .

Cut beef flank steak in half lengthwise. Slice each half into 1/8-inch-thick slices, cutting on the diagonal, against the grain of the meat.
Cook linguine according to package directions (but don't add salt to the boiling water).
Meanwhile, in a 5-quart Dutch oven or 12-inch skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Add green onions and peppers and cook until tender-crisp, about 5 minutes, stirring frequently. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside in a large bowl.
In same Dutch oven over high heat, add 3 more tablespoons of olive oil. When the oil is hot, cook the flank steak with 1/2 teaspoon of salt until the meat is tender and loses its pink color, about 3 minutes. Remove Dutch oven from heat, stir in olives, parsley, crushed red pepper, and vegetable mixture.
Drain linguine, add it to meat mixture, and toss to combine. Season with salt. Transfer pasta to a serving bowl, tucking the provolone pieces into the pasta. If not serving right away, cover and refrigerate to serve chilled later.

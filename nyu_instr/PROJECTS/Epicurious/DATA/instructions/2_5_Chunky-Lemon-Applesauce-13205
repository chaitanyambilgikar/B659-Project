In a large heavy saucepan combine the apples, 3/4 cup water, the lemon juice, and the sugar, bring the liquid to a boil, and simmer the mixture, stirring occasionally and breaking up the apples, for 20 minutes, or until the apples are tender and the mixture is the consistency of a chunky purée. Increase the heat and boil the mixture, stirring, for 4 minutes, or until it is thickened. (The mixture will spatter.) Serve the applesauce warm or chilled.

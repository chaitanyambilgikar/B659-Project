Assemble brownie pops: Using 2 3/4-inch round cookie cutter, cut each brownie into circle. Using small offset spatula or knife, spread frosting in thin even layer on top of each brownie.
Decorate brownie pops: Sprinkle each brownie with white sprinkles.
To create eyes, arrange 2 butterscotch candies near top of 1 brownie and press gently to secure. Using small offset spatula or knife, place small dollop of frosting onto 1 black M&M, then gently press into 1 butterscotch. Repeat with second M&M on second butterscotch. To create nose, place 1 cashew between butterscotch eyes and press gently to secure. To create feathers, arrange about 7 pieces candy corn above eyes and press gently to secure. Decorate remaining brownies in same manner.
Insert candy or craft stick into one side of each brownie.

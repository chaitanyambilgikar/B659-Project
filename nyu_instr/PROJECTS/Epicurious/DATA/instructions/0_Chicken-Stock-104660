Bring all ingredients to a boil in an 8- to 10-quart heavy pot, covered. Reduce heat and gently simmer, partially covered, until chicken is very tender, about 3 hours.
Remove chicken and reserve for another use. Pour stock through a fine sieve lined with a triple thickness of cheesecloth into a large bowl and discard vegetables.

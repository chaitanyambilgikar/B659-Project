Cover potatoes with salted cold water by 1 inchin a large saucepan and simmer, uncovered, until tender, 20 to 30 minutes.
While potatoes are simmering, bring cream, butter, salt, and pepper to a simmer in a small saucepan. Remove from heat and keep warm, covered.
Drain potatoes in a colander and cool slightly. Peel potatoes and mash in large saucepan.
Stir spinach into warm cream, tossing to coat, and when slightly wilted (after about 1 minute), immediately add to potatoes. Mash potatoes until almost smooth. Serve immediately.

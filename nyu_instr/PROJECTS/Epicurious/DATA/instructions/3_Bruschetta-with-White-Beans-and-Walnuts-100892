Preheat oven to 350°F.
In a shallow baking pan toast nuts in middle of oven until fragrant, about 10 minutes, and when cool coarsely chop. Rinse and drain beans. In a food processor mince garlic and purée with beans, lemon juice, and 1 tablespoon oil until smooth.
Toast bread and drizzle with 2 tablespoons oil. Divide purée among toasts and top with nuts. Drizzle remaining tablespoon oil over bruschetta and garnish with parsley.

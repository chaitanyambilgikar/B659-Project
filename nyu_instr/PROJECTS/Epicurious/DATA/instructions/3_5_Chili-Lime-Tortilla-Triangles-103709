Preheat oven to 350°F.
Stir together paprika, achiote, cayenne, salt, lime juice, and oil.
Put 1 tortilla on each of 2 baking sheets and brush with oil mixture. Cut each tortilla into long thin triangles with a sharp knife.
Bake in upper and lower thirds of oven, switching position of sheets halfway through baking, until crisp and lightly golden, 15 to 20 minutes total. Transfer triangles to racks to cool. Repeat with remaining 2 tortillas.

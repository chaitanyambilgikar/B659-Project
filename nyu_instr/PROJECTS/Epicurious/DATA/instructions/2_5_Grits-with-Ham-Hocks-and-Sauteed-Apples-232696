Preheat oven to 325°F. Melt butter in large ovenproof pot over high heat. Add onions and next 3 ingredients; sauté until vegetables are soft and golden, about 7 minutes. Add vermouth and next 3 ingredients; stir 1 minute. Add chicken broth and ham hocks. Bring to boil; cover and bake until ham hocks are very tender, about 1 hour. Cool.
Remove ham hocks. Boil ham hock broth until reduced to 1 cup, about 25 minutes. Pull ham from bones and reserve (discard bones and skin). Strain broth. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Cover ham and broth separately; chill.)
For grits: Preheat oven to 350°F. Bring chicken broth to boil in large saucepan. Gradually whisk in grits. Add 2 teaspoons minced thyme. Reduce heat to medium; simmer until grits are thick and smooth, whisking frequently, about 7 minutes.
Stir reserved ham, Sautéed Apples, and 1 cup cheddar cheese into grits. Transfer mixture to 13x9x2-inch oval baking dish. Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup cheese. Bake until cheese is golden, about 30 minutes. Rewarm ham hock broth. Garnish grits with chopped thyme and serve, drizzling broth over.

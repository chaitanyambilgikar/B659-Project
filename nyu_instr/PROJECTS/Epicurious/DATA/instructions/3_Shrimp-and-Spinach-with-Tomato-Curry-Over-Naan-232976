Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 400°F. Put naan on a baking sheet and bake until bread is crisp outside but still soft and pliable, about 8 minutes.
Meanwhile, pat shrimp dry and sprinkle with salt. Melt butter in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat, then transfer 1 tablespoon melted butter to a small bowl. Add garlic and shrimp to skillet and sauté over high heat, stirring occasionally, until garlic is pale golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in sauce and water and simmer, stirring occasionally, until shrimp are just cooked through, about 4 minutes. Stir in spinach until just wilted. Season with salt and remove from heat.
Put hot naan on 4 plates and brush tops with reserved melted butter. Spoon shrimp and curry sauce over naan.

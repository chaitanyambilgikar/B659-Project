Cover the turkey pieces with water and add the onion stuck with cloves, the celery, parsley, and peppers. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat, skim off any scum which may rise to the top, and cover the pot. Simmer until the turkey is tender but not falling from the bones. Remove the turkey pieces and cool until they can be handled. Remove the meat from the bones in good-size pieces.
Reduce the broth by half over a brisk flame. You should have about 4 cups broth. Strain and adjust the salt. Add the chili powder, the green chiles,and the ground nuts and simmer until the mixture is thickened, smooth and well blended in flavor. You may find you may wish to add additional chili powder. Sauté the onion, garlic, and green peppers in the olive oil. Add to the sauce and cook for 5 minutes. Add the turkey meat and cook thoroughly. Add the olives and blanched almonds and reheat for 3 minutes.
Serve with rice or polenta and crisp French bread. A radish and cucumber salad with a vinaigrette sauce is good with this. Tortillas are excellent with the chili if you don't serve polenta and French bread. Drink beer.

Cut bread into 3/4-inch cubes. Place in very large bowl. Whisk eggs, milk, 1 cup cream, and next 4 ingredients in large bowl until sugar dissolves. Pour egg mixture over bread; toss to coat. Cover with plastic and place plate on top to submerge bread in egg mixture. Chill at least 4 hours or overnight.
Stir bread mixture; let stand at room temperature 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375°F. Butter sixteen 3/4-cup custard cups or ramekins; divide between 2 roasting pans. Divide bread mixture among cups. Add enough hot water to pans to come halfway up sides of cups.
Bake puddings until puffed, edges are golden, and tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 40 minutes. DO AHEAD: Let puddings stand at room temperature up to 2 hours.
Using electric mixer, beat remaining 1 cup cream and powdered sugar in medium bowl until peaks form. Serve puddings warm or at room temperature with whipped cream and warm caramel sauce.

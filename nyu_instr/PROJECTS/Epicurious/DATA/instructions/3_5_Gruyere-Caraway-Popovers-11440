With a mortar and pestle or in an electric coffee or spice grinder coarse 1/4 teaspoon caraway seeds.
Preheat oven to 375°F. Generously grease six 2/3-cup popover tins or nine 1/2-cup muffin tins.
In a bowl whisk together eggs, milk, and water and add butter in a stream, whisking. Add flour and salt and whisk mixture until combined well but still slightly lumpy, whisking ground caraway seeds into batter. Divide half of batter among tins and sprinkle 1/4 cup Gruyère and whole caraway seeds over popovers. Bake popovers in lower third of oven 45 minutes. Cut a slit about 1/2 inch long on top of each popover with a small sharp knife and bake 10 minutes more.

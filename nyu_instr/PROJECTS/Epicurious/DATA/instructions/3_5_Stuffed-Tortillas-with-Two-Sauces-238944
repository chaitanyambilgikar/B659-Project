Make tomato sauce: Preheat broiler.
Toss tomatoes with 1 tablespoon oil in a shallow baking pan and broil 4 to 5 inches from heat, turning once, until softened and skins are charred in spots, 15 to 20 minutes total.
Blend tomatoes, water, onion, garlic, vinegar, chile, and 1 teaspoon salt in a blender until smooth (use caution with hot liquids).
Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a large heavy saucepan over medium- high heat until it shimmers, then add sauce and simmer, partially covered, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 10 minutes.
Make pumpkin-seed sauce: Toast pumpkin seeds in a dry 12-inch heavy skillet over medium heat, stirring, until all seeds have expanded but are still green, 5 to 8 minutes. Transfer to a bowl to cool slightly.
Coarsely chop 1/4 cup pumpkin seeds and set aside. Bring water, epazote, onion, garlic, and 1 1/4teaspoons salt to a boil in a small saucepan.

Season with salt.

Fry and fill tortillas: Heat remaining cup oil in a 10-inch heavy skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers, then soft-fry tortillas, 1 at a time, turning over once with tongs, until softened (not crisp or browned), 5 to 10 seconds.

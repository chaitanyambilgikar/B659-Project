Preheat oven to 425°F. Sprinkle fish with salt and pepper. Set aside. Heat oil in heavy medium oven-proof skillet over medium-high heat. Add garlic and red pepper. Sauté until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add shallots and fennel. Sauté until shallots are tender, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes with juices and clam juice. Simmer until fennel is tender and liquid reduces slightly, about 5 minutes. Stir in olives.
Arrange halibut atop tomato mixture. Bake until fish is opaque in center, about 18 minutes. Stir basil into vegetable mixture and serve.

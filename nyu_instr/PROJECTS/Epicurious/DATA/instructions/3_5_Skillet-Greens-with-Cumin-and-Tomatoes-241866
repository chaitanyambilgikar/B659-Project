Heat oil in large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and cumin; stir 1 minute. Add greens by large handfuls; stir just until beginning to wilt before adding more, tossing until coated with oil. Cook until tender, 1 to 6 minutes. Add tomatoes and sauté until heated through, about 2 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve.

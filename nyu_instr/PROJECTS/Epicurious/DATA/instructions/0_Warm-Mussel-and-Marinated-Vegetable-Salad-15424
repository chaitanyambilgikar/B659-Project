Bring a pot of water to a boil and blanch the zucchini for 1 minute. Drain and refresh under cold running water. Drain again and place in a bowl with the fennel, tomato, and shallot. Season with cayenne, salt, and pepper. Add the parsley, basil, garlic, capers, olives, and olive oils. Mix well. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to 6 hours.
Arrange the mussels in a radial pattern in 4 shallow, oven proof bowls. (The mussels maybe arranged and refrigerated several hours before serving.)
To serve, preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Place the mussels in the oven just to warm them through, about 2 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, top the mussels with the vegetable mixture. Drizzle about 1 tablespoon of the oil from the mixture over each bowl. Serve immediately.

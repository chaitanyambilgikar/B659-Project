1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Butter a baking pan and place the pork chops in it.
2. Press a clove into each chop. Add the white wine, celery leaves, and bay leaves and put the pan in the preheated oven. Bake the chops for 30 minutes.
3. While the pork chops are baking, in a frying pan sauté the diced celery in the butter or 5 minutes, and then add the sliced apples and sprinkle with the brown sugar.
Continue cooking over very low heat for 10 minutes, or until the apples are tender but not mushy.
4. Finish the pork chops by removing the bay and celery leaves and sprinkling the cheese over the top of each chop; baste and then broil for a few minutes to brown the top.

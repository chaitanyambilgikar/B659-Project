For sauce: Combine raspberries and their juices and sugar in blender. Puree until sugar dissolves. Strain sauce into bowl. Cover and refrigerate.
For custard: Combine sugar and potato starch in heavy large saucepan; whisk to blend. Gradually add nondairy creamer, whisking until well blended. Whisk in egg yolks, lemon peel and lemon juice. Add margarine. Whisk over medium-high heat until custard is thick and smooth and just begins to bubble, about 9 minutes. Transfer to bowl. Refrigerate uncovered until cold, about 4 hours; then cover and keep chilled.
For cake: Preheat oven to 350°F. Combine orange juice concentrate, lemon juice and both peels in small bowl; whisk to blend. Combine cake meal and potato starch in medium bowl; whisk to blend.
Using handheld electric mixer, beat egg yolks and 3/4 cup sugar in large bowl until thick about 1 minute. Beat in orange concentrate mixture, then dry ingredients. Using clean dry beaters, beat whites and salt in another large bowl until soft peaks form. Gradually add remaining 3/4 cup sugar, beating until stiff but not dry. Fold whites into yolk mixture in 3 additions.
Transfer batter to ungreased 10-inch-diameter angel food cake pan with 4-inch-high sides. Bake cake until golden brown and tester inserted near center comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Immediately invert center tube of cake pan onto narrow-neck bottle. Cool cake completely. (Sauce, custard and cake can be made 1 day ahead. Keep sauce and custard chilled. Cover cake in pan; store at room temperature.)
Cut cake from pan. Cut cake into twelve 1-inch-thick slices (reserve remaining for another use.) Trim crusts. Cut each slice into 6 squares. Place 3 banana slices in each of twelve 1- to 1 1/4-cup stemmed glasses. Spoon 1 tablespoon sauce over. Top with 3 cake pieces, 2 tablespoons custard, 4 banana slices and 1 1/2 tablespoons sauce. Repeat layering with cake, custard, banana and sauce. Garnish with mint, lemon and additional banana slices, if desired. Chill up to 6 hours.

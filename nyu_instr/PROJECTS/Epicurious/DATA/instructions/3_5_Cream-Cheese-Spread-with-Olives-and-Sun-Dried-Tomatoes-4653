Place sun-dried tomatoes in small bowl. Pour enough boiling water over tomatoes to cover. Let tomatoes stand until soft, about 10 minutes. Drain. Pat tomatoes dry and chop finely.
Mix cream cheese and sour cream in medium bowl until smooth. Mix in olives, onion and sun-dried tomatoes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 2 days ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Let stand at room temperature 1 hour before serving.)

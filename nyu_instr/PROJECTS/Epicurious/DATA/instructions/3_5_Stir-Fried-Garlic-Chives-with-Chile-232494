Heat wok over high heat until a drop of water vaporizes instantly upon contact. Add oil, swirling to coat wok evenly, and heat until hot and just smoking. Add chives and red pepper flakes and stir-fry, letting chives rest on bottom and sides of wok several seconds between stirs, until chives are tender and slightly browned, 2 to 4 minutes. Stir in salt. Serve over rice.

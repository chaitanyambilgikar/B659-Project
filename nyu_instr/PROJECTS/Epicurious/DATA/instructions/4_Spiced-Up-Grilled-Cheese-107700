Blend tomato paste, chilies, and molasses in processor until smooth. Spread 1 tablespoon chipotle mixture over 1 side of each bread slice.
Arrange 6 bread slices, chipotle side up, on work surface. Divide half of cheese among bread slices. Top with tomatoes, then onion, cilantro, and remaining cheese. Top sandwiches with remaining bread, chipotle side down. Spread butter on outside of sandwich tops and bottoms.
Heat 2 large griddles over medium heat. Place 3 sandwiches on each griddle; cook until bread is golden and cheese is melted, about 5 minutes per side.
*Canned chipotle chilies in adobo sauce are available at Latin American markets and most supermarkets

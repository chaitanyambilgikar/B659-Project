For crust: Blend flour and hazelnuts in processor until nuts are finely ground. Add brown sugar and salt; blend 20 seconds. Add butter and lard; using on/off turns, process until mixture resembles coarse meal. Transfer mixture to bowl. Add 4 tablespoons ice water; stir until moist clumps form, adding more ice water by teaspoonfuls if dough is dry. Gather dough together; divide into 2 equal pieces. Form each into ball; flatten each into disk. Wrap each in plastic wrap and chill 1 hour.
For filling: Position rack in bottom third of oven and preheat to 400°F. Toss apples, 1/2 cup sugar, brown sugar, flour, and cinnamon in large bowl. Roll out 1 dough disk on generously floured surface to 12-inch round, rotating crust often to prevent sticking. Generously flour 11- or 12-inch tart pan bottom. Slide tart pan bottom under dough round. Carefully slide dough round into 9-inch pie dish. Press crust onto bottom and up sides of dish; pinch and press to seal any cracks. Spoon filling into crust; drizzle with melted butter.
Roll out second dough disk on generously floured surface to 13-inch round. Slide same floured tart pan bottom under dough round. Carefully allow dough round to slide off tart pan bottom onto pie filling; pinch to seal any cracks in crust. Press top crust and bottom crust together at edge. Fold edge under; crimp decoratively. Cut X in center of top crust. Brush top crust lightly with milk. Sprinkle with remaining 1 tablespoon sugar. Transfer pie to rimmed baking sheet. Bake pie 30 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350°F. Bake pie 25 minutes. Cover crust edges with foil collar to prevent overbrowning; continue baking until crust is golden, apples are tender, and juices are bubbling thickly in center, about 20 minutes longer. Transfer pie to rack and cool. Serve with ice cream.

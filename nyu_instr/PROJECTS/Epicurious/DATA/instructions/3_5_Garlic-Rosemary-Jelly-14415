Skim off any foam and ladle jelly immediately into jars, filling to within 1/8 inch of top. Wipe rims with dampened cloth and seal jars with liquids.
Put jars in water-bath canner or on a rack set in a deep kettle. Add enough hot water to cover jars by 2 inches and bring to a boil. Boil jars, covered, 5 minutes and transfer with tongs to a rack. Cool jars completely and store in a cool, dark place.
To sterilize jars and glasses for pickling and preserving: Wash jars in hot suds and rinse in scalding water. Put jars in a kettle and cover with hot water. Bring water to a boil, covered, and boil jars 15 minutes from the time that steam emerges from the kettle. Turn off heat and let jars stand in hot water. Just before they are to be filled invert jars onto a kitchen towel to dry. (Jars should be filled while still hot.) Sterilize jar lids 5 minutes, or according to manufacturer's instructions.

Preheat oven to 350°F.
In a shallow baking pan spread seeds evenly and toast in middle of oven, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 8 minutes. Cool seeds.
Into a bowl sift together flour, baking powder, and table salt. With your fingertips or a pastry blender blend in lard or shortening until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add seeds and milk, stirring until a soft dough is formed. Divide dough in half. Keeping remaining piece of dough wrapped in plastic wrap, roll out 1 piece between sheets of plastic wrap to 1/8 inch thick (about an 8 1/2-inch square) and remove top sheet of plastic wrap. With a sharp knife cut dough into 1 1/2-inch squares, reserving scraps. Peel squares off plastic wrap and arrange about 1/2 inch apart on ungreased baking sheets. Roll out and cut remaining piece of dough in same manner. Reroll reserved scraps and cut in same manner.
Bake wafers in batches in middle of oven until pale golden, 12 to 15 minutes. Sprinkle wafers with coarse salt and transfer to a rack to cool. Wafers may be made 1 week ahead and kept in an airtight container at cool room temperature.

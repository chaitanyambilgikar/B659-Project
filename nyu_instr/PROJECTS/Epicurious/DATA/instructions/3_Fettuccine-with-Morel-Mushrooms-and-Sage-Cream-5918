Bring 2 cups water to boil in heavy small saucepan; add mushrooms. Remove pan from heat. Let stand until mushrooms soften, about 15 minutes. Drain mushrooms, reserving soaking liquid.
Meanwhile, cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite. Drain pasta.
Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and sauté until just softened, about 5 minutes. Add wine and cook 1 minute. Pour in mushroom liquid, leaving any sediment behind. Add mushrooms, cream, and sage. Simmer until sauce thickens slightly, about 7 minutes. Add pasta and toss to coat with sauce. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to plates and serve.

Preheat oven to 400°F.
Arrange rhubarb in 1 layer on a lightly oiled shallow (1-inch-deep) baking pan and sprinkle with confectioners sugar. Roast in middle of oven 30 minutes, or until very tender. Cool in pan on a rack.
Purée rhubarb in a blender, scraping down sides several times, until smooth and transfer to a bowl. Purée strawberries and corn syrup in blender. Force purée through a fine sieve into a bowl and discard seeds. Stir one third of rhubarb purée into strawberry purée.
Stir together remaining rhubarb purée and ice cream and freeze until firm enough to scoop, 1 to 2 hours.
Layer strawberry-rhubarb purée and ice-cream mixture in 8 (6-oz) stemmed glasses.
Serve immediately.

Fashion beef into 6 patties no more than 1/4 inch thick and season each patty with salt.
Spread bottom half of each bun with 1/2 tablespoon softened butter.
On a griddle or in a large heavy skillet fry onions in additional 3 tablespoons butter over moderately high heat, stirring, until barely softened, and push to side of griddle or skillet. Fry burgers, flipping once, about 2 minutes on each side for well-done.
Transfer burgers to buttered bun bottoms while still hot (to melt butter) and top with onion, tomato, and lettuce. Spread condiments on bun tops.
Serve burgers with plenty of napkins.

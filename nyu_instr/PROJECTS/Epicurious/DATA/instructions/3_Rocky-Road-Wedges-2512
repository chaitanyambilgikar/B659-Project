Preheat oven to 350°F. Cream butter and sugar in large bowl until fluffy. Beat in eggs. Combine flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt in bowl. Stir dry ingredients in butter mixture. Mix in 2 cups chocolate chips and almonds.
Divide dough in half. On back of ungreased baking sheet, pat each half into 8-inch round. Bake until cookies are set but centers are still soft, about 15 minutes. Sprinkle each round with 1/2 cup mini marshmallows and 1/2 cup chocolate chips. Bake until marshmallows and chips soften, about 3 minutes longer. Cool 5 minutes. Cut each round into 12 wedges. Slide wedges off sheet and cool completely on rack.
Top wedges with ice cream.

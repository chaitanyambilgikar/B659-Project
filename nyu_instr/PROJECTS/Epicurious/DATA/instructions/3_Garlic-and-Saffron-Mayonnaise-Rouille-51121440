1. Finely chop the garlic. Sprinkle a pinch of salt over the garlic and continue chopping and smashing it with the side of your knife to form a coarse paste. Transfer the paste to a medium mixing bowl.
2. Add the egg yolk, lemon juice, saffron and its soaking water, breadcrumbs, and a pinch of cayenne and black peppers. Whisk to combine the ingredients. Continue whisking constantly while drizzling the olive oil into the bowl in a slow, steady stream. When all of the oil is included, the mixture should have a consistency similar to that of mayonnaise. Serve the rouille or store it in the refrigerator, covered or jarred, for future use.

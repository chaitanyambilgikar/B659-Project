Whisk 3/4 cup flour, 2/3 cup sugar and 1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice in medium bowl to blend. Rub in butter with fingertips until mixture forms moist clumps. Mix in pecans. (Topping can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
Preheat oven to 375°F. Butter 8 x 8 x 2-inch glass baking dish. Combine figs and applejack in large bowl. Let stand 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Mix apples, 1 tablespoon flour, 2 tablespoons sugar and 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice into figs. Transfer mixture to prepared baking dish. Sprinkle with topping. Bake 40 minutes. Cover loosely with foil. Continue to bake until apples are very tender, about 20 minutes longer. Uncover; let cool at least 30 minutes.
Spoon crisp into large shallow bowls. Serve with cream, if desired.

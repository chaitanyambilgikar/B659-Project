Cook wheat berries in a 4-quart pot of boiling water (unsalted), uncovered, until tender, about 1 hour, then drain in a large sieve.
After wheat berries have been cooking 45 minutes, cook onion in butter and oil in a heavy skillet over moderate heat, stirring, until softened, about 6 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in wheat berries, kosher salt, pepper, and pecans.

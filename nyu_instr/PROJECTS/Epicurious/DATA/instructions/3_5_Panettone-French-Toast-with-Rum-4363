Preheat oven to 200°F. Cut bread into 1-inch-thick slices. Cut slices into twenty 5x1-inch strips. Reserve any remaining bread for another use. Combine sugar and cinnamon in small bowl. In shallow bowl, whisk together eggs, milk and rum.
Dip 5 bread strips into egg mixture; let stand 2 minutes. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in large nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Cook bread until golden brown and firm touch, about 4 minutes on each side. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons cinnamon sugar over French toast, turning to coat on all sides. Cook until sugar melts, turning once, about 2 minutes. Transfer French toast to baking sheet; keep warm in oven. Repeat with remaining bread, egg mixture, butter and cinnamon sugar in 3 more batches. Transfer French toast to plates.

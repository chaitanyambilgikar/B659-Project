In a heavy skillet brown the kielbasa over moderate heat, stirring, transfer it with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain, and pour off all but 1 tablespoon of the fat. In the fat remaining in the skillet cook the garlic over moderately low heat, stirring, until it is golden, add the broccoli rabe, and cook the mixture, stirring, for 1 minute, or until the broccoli rabe is wilted. Add the water, simmer the mixture, stirring occasionally, for 5 to 7 minutes, or until the broccoli rabe is tender, and stir in the kielbasa. In a kettle of boiling salted water cook the pasta until it is al dente and drain it well. In a large bowl toss together the pasta, the oil, the kielbasa mixture, and salt and pepper to taste.

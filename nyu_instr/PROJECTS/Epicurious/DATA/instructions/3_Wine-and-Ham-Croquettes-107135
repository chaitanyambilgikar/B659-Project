Melt butter with 5 tablespoons oil in heavy large saucepan over medium heat. Add flour; stir 3 minutes. Gradually stir in wine, broth, milk, and nutmeg. Stir until mixture thickens, about 45 seconds. Add ham and parsley; cook until mixture is thick, stirring frequently, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Cool completely, stirring occasionally.
Spread ham mixture on plate. Refrigerate at least 2 hours and up to 4 hours.
Place beaten eggs and panko in separate medium bowls. Shape ham mixture into 1-inch balls. Dip balls in egg, then coat with panko.
Heat enough oil to come 1/2 inch up sides of pan in heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add half of croquettes and fry until golden brown, turning occasionally, about 2 minutes. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Repeat with remaining croquettes. Transfer to platter.

Cook onions in large pot of boiling water 3 minutes. Drain and cool. Cut off root ends, then peel.
Combine peeled onions, beef stock, 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar, butter and sugar in heavy large skillet. Bring to simmer over medium heat. Cover; simmer until onions are crisp-tender, about 15 minutes. Add 1/2 tablespoon vinegar. Simmer uncovered until syrupy, stirring occasionally, about 25 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Mix in 1 tablespoon parsley. Transfer to bowl. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon parsley.

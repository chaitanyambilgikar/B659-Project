Rinse chicken and pat dry, then sprinkle with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.
Heat oil in a 6- to 8-quart heavy pot over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then brown chicken in 2 batches, skin sides down first, turning over once, about 12 minutes per batch. Transfer chicken to a shallow bowl. Add onion and garlic to pot and sauté, stirring, until lightly browned, about 6 minutes.
Add paprika and stir in tomato sauce and water. Add chicken pieces, skin sides up, and simmer, covered, until chicken is very tender but not falling off the bone, about 30 minutes. Remove lid and cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce is thickened, about 10 minutes more. Stir in remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.
Transfer 1 cup sauce to a bowl and whisk in sour cream, then stir mixture into remaining sauce in pot and season with salt.

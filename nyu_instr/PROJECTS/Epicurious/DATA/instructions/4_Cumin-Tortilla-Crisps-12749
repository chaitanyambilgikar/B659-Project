Arrange the tortilla strips in one layer on 2 jelly-roll pans, cover them with a kitchen towel, and let them stand for 1 hour. In a small bowl stir together the oil, the cumin, and salt and pepper to taste, drizzle the mixture over the strips, and toss the strips to coat them with it. Bake the strips in a preheated 425°F. oven, shaking the pans occasionally and switching the pans once, for 8 to 10 minutes, or until they are golden and crisp. Transfer the crisps to paper towels to drain and sprinkle them with the salt. The tortilla crisps may be made 1 day in advance and kept in an airtight container.

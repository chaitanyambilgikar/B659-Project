Preheat oven to 350°F.
Pat pork dry and season with salt and pepper. Stir together cornmeal and cumin and transfer to a plate. Turn pork in cornmeal mixture to coat well and discard any remaining mixture.
Heat oil in a 10-inch nonstick skillet until hot but not smoking and brown pork, turning, about 3 minutes. Transfer pork to a shallow baking pan and roast in middle of oven until a thermometer inserted diagonally at least 2 inches into pork registers 155°F, 30 to 45 minutes. Let stand, loosely covered, 10 minutes. Cut pork into 12 slices (about 1/4 inch thick).

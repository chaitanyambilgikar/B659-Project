Cook potatoes in boiling, salted water until tender. Drain and peel. Put through food mill or ricer. Blend in 6 tablespoons butter, cream and one by one, egg yolks, beating well after each addition. Shape mixture into 4 cakes same size as beef slices and 1 1/2-inch to 2-inch thick. Let cool. Dip in flour, brush with beaten egg, dip in bread crumbs and deep fry in hot fat until browned and crisp. Drain on absorbent paper and arrange on hot platter. Keep hot.
Sauté beef slices quickly in 4 tablespoons butter until nicely browned on the outside but still rare and juicy in the center-about 5 to 7 minutes. Season to taste with salt and freshly ground pepper and arrange on top of the potato croquettes. To the pan in which te beef was cooked, add the Madeira, julienne strips of truffle and glace de viande. Blend and cook down for a minute. Pour sauce over meat and garnish each filet with a truffle slice and parsley. With this, drink a fine Medoc.

In a food processor purée the red peppers, the tomatoes, the garlic, the cumin, the jalapeños, the lemon juice, the coriander, and the scallion until the mixture is smooth, add the cream cheese and salt to taste, and purée the mixture, adding enough of the reserved tomato-soaking liquid to thin the dip to the desired consistency and scraping down the side of the bowl occasionally, until it is smooth. Transfer the dip to a serving bowl and serve it with the tortilla chips.

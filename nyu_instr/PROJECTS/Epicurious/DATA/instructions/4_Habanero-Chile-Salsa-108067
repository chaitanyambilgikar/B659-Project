Preheat broiler. Line rimmed baking sheet with foil. Arrange tomatillos, onion, garlic, and chile on prepared baking sheet. Broil until vegetables blacken in spots, about 5 minutes per side for chile and about 10 minutes per side for tomatillos, onion, and garlic.
Transfer vegetables and any accumulated juices to blender. Add cilantro, lime juice, and salt. Puree until smooth. Transfer salsa to bowl. Cover and refrigerate until cold, at least 1 hour and up to 4 hours. Season salsa to taste with more salt.

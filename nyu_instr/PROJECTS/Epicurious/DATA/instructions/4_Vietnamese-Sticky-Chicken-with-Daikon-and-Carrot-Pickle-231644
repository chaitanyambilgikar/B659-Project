Marinate chicken: Whisk together garlic, sugar, fish sauce, oil, lime juice, and hot sauce in a large bowl until sugar is dissolved. Add chicken and toss to coat, then marinate 15 minutes.
Make pickle while chicken marinates: Cut carrots and radish into 1/8-inch-thick matchsticks (2 inches long) with slicer. Whisk together vinegar, sugar, and salt in a bowl until sugar is dissolved, then add vegetables and toss to combine. Let stand, tossing occasionally, until wilted, about 15 minutes.
Grill chicken: Heat grill pan over moderately high heat until hot, then grill chicken in 4 batches, turning over once with tongs, until just cooked through, about 1 minute total per batch. Transfer chicken to a plate as grilled and keep warm, covered with foil. Serve with pickle and accompaniments.

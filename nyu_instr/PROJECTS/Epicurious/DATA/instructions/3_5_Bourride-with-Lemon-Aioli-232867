Transfer 1 1/3 cups aioli to medium bowl; reserve remaining aioli. Mix lemon juice and saffron in small bowl; set aside.
Heat oil in large pot over medium heat. Add leeks, fennel, and carrots; sauté 10 minutes. Stir in bay leaves and orange peel, then clam juice and lemon-saffron mixture. Bring to boil over medium-high heat. Add fish; reduce heat to medium. Simmer until fish is opaque in center, occasionally spooning liquid over fish to submerge if necessary, about 8 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer fish to large bowl; cover.
Boil liquid in pot 10 minutes to reduce slightly. Whisk 1/2 cup reduced liquid into bowl with 1 1/3 cups aioli, then whisk in egg yolks. Return yolk-aioli mixture to remaining liquid in pot. Using wooden spoon, stir constantly over medium-low heat until sauce thickens slightly, about 7 minutes (do not boil). Remove from heat. Season with salt and pepper. Stir fish and any accumulated juices into hot sauce in pot; let stand until fish is heated through, about 5 minutes.
Divide bourride among 8 shallow bowls. Garnish with chervil sprigs, if desired. Serve remaining aioli alongside.

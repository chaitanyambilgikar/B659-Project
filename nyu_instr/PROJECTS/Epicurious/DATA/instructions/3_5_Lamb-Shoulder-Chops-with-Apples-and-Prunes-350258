Combine brandy, vinegar, prunes, and bay leaf and let stand until ready to use.
Pat lamb chops dry and season with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Heat oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over high heat until it shimmers. Cook lamb, turning once, 6 to 7 minutes total for medium-rare. Transfer to a plate and let stand, loosely covered. Discard fat from skillet.
Add butter and apple to skillet and sauté over medium-high heat until beginning to brown, about 3 minutes. Add shallot and garlic and sauté 2 minutes. Remove from heat and add prune mixture. Boil until liquid is reduced to a glaze. Add chicken broth and any meat juices from plate and simmer, crushing prunes with a fork, until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and discard bay leaf. Serve over lamb.

Cook garlic in oil in a 10-inch heavy skillet over low heat, turning occasionally, until tender and golden, about 15 minutes. Transfer garlic with a slotted spoon to a cutting board and mash to a paste with a fork. Cook paprika, salt, and pepper in oil remaining in skillet over low heat, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute.
Stir together paprika oil, garlic paste, and short rib meat in a large bowl until combined well. Pack mixture into a 5- to 6-cup crock, terrine, or bowl and let stand at room temperature 1 hour to allow flavors to develop. Serve at room temperature.

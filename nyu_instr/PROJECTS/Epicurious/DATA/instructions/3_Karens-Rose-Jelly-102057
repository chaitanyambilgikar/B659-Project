Simmer the rose hips (available in Scandinavian food shops) and 6 cups of water in a covered pot over low heat for 3 hours, or until very soft. (Or cook in a pressure cooker for 1 hour.) Drip through a jelly bag overnight. (If you do not have a jelly bag, line a colander with 4 thicknesses of cheesecloth and set over a bowl.) Quarter the apples and simmer in remaining water in a covered pot over low heat until reduced to a pulp. Drip through a jelly bag overnight. The next day, measure 4 cups of rose hip juice and 4 cups of apple juice into a large preserving kettle. (If the juice is insufficient, add water to make up the difference.) Add the sugar and bring to a boil over high heat, stirring constantly until the sugar is dissolved. Continue to boil until a thermometer registers 220° or until the juice thickens and sheets from the side of a spoon (i.e., when the last 2 drops on the spoon run together). Skim the jelly, pour into hot, sterilized jelly glasses and cover with a thin layer of melted paraffin. When the paraffin has hardened, cover the glasses and store.

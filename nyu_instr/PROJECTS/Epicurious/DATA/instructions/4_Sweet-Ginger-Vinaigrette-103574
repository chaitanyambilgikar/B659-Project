Heat oil in an 8-inch skillet over moderate heat until it shimmers and a single julienne of ginger dropped into it bubbles to surface immediately. Stir in remaining ginger julienne. Fry just until golden, 10 to 20 seconds, then carefully pour mixture into a sieve set over a heatproof bowl. Spread fried ginger on paper towels to drain (for salad topping) and cool oil.
Press or squeeze enough grated ginger to extract 2 tablespoons juice using a fine sieve or cheesecloth.
Whisk together ginger juice, vinegar, sugar, and peppercorn salt to taste until sugar is dissolved, then whisk in cooled ginger oil.
Use fried ginger as a salad topping.

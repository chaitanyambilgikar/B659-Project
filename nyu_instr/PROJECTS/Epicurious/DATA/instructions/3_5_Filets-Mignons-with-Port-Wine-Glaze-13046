Pat filets dry and season with salt and pepper. In a small bowl whisk together Port, vinegar, and mustard until combined well.
In a non-stick skillet heat oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and cook filets 4 minutes. Turn filets and cook 4 minutes more for medium-rare. Transfer filets to a warm platter. Pour Port mixture carefully down side of skillet and boil, stirring, until reduced to about 2 tablespoons. Serve filets with glaze.

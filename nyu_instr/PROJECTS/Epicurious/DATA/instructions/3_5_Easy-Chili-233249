Heat oil in a deep 12-inch heavy skillet over high heat until very hot but not smoking, then cook beef, chili powder (to taste), cumin, salt, pepper, and garlic, stirring occasionally, until meat is no longer pink (some clumps will remain), about 2 minutes. Stir in onions and peppers and salsa and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, 20 minutes. Stir in beans and simmer 2 minutes.

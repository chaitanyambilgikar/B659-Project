Heat oil in very large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add all peppers; sauté until slightly softened, stirring occasionally, about 7 minutes. Add raisins and fennel seeds. Continue to cook until peppers are soft, about 5 minutes. Stir in vinegar. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.) Add 8 cups arugula to peppers and stir until arugula begins to wilt, about 1 minute. Transfer mixture to large platter; garnish with additional arugula and serve.

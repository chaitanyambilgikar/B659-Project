Cut butter into 1/2-inch cubes. In a bowl whisk together flour, sugar, and salt to taste. With your fingertips or a pastry blender blend together flour mixture and butter until mixture resembles coarse meal. In a small bowl with a fork lightly beat together whole egg, yolk, vanilla, and lemon juice and stir into flour mixture. Toss mixture with fork until egg mixture is absorbed. With your hands gently knead mixture in bowl until it comes together and forms a dough. Turn dough out onto a very lightly floured surface and knead 4 or 5 times. Form dough into a disk. Chill dough, wrapped in plastic wrap, at least 1 hour and up to 1 day.

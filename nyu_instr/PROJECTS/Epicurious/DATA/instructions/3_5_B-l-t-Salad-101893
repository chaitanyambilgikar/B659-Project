In a skillet cook bacon over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until crisp. Reserving 1 tablespoon bacon fat in skillet, drain bacon on paper towels and crumble. Cut bread into enough 3/4-inch cubes to measure 1 cup. Heat fat over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and sauté bread cubes with salt to taste, stirring, until golden brown. Transfer croutons to paper towels to drain and cool.
In a small bowl whisk together garlic, lemon juice, mayonnaise, water, and salt and pepper to taste. Slice onion and halve tomatoes. Tear lettuce into bite-size pieces.
In a large bowl toss together onion, tomatoes, lettuce, half of bacon and croutons, salt and pepper to taste, and enough dressing to coat.
Divide salad between 2 plates and top with remaining croutons and bacon.

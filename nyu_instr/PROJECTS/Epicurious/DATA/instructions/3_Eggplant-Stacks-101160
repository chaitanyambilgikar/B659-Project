Cut eggplant crosswise into twelve 1/3-inch-thick slices, discarding ends, and arrange in one layer on paper towels. Sprinkle both sides of slices evenly with salt and cover with another layer of paper towels. Let eggplant stand 30 minutes. Pat eggplant dry.
Preheat oven to 375°F. and oil a shallow baking pan.
Arrange 4 eggplant slices in one layer in pan and spread each slice evenly with 1 teaspoon pesto. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons Monterey Jack evenly over pesto on each slice. Continue to layer remaining eggplant slices, pesto, and Monterey Jack in same manner. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon Parmesan evenly over each stack and bake in middle of oven until eggplant is tender, 20 to 25 minutes.

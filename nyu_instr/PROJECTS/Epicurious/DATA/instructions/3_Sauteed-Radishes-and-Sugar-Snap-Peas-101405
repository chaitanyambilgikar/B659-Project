Cook sugar snap peas in large pot of boiling salted water until crisp-tender, about 2 minutes. Drain. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Wrap in paper towels. Place in resealable plastic bag and refrigerate.) Melt butter in heavy large pot over medium heat. Add radishes and sauté until translucent and crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Add sugar snap peas. Sauté until peas are heated through, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
Transfer vegetables to bowl; serve.

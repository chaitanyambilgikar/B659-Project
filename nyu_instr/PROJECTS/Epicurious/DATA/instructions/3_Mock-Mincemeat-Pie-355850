For crust: Place crusts on 2 rimless baking sheets and chill while preparing filling.
For filling: Place 1/3 of apples in processor. Using on/off turns, chop into small pieces. Transfer chopped apples to large saucepan. Repeat chopping remaining apples in 2 more batches in processor; add to saucepan. Place all dried fruit in processor. Using on/off turns, chop until beginning to stick together. Add dried fruits to saucepan with apples. Add sugar, molasses, rum, brandy, cornstarch, butter, orange peel, lemon peel, spices, and sea salt; stir to blend. Simmer over medium-low heat until mixture is very thick, stirring often to prevent scorching, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from heat. Transfer pie filling to large bowl and cool completely, about 1 hour.
Position rack in bottom third of oven; preheat to 375°F. Transfer 1 crust to 9-inch glass pie dish, leaving dough overhang. Spread cooled filling in crust. Cut second crust into 1/2-inch-wide strips. Arrange 6 dough strips atop filling, spacing 1 inch apart. Place 6 dough strips at 45-degree angle to first strips, forming diamond lattice pattern. Trim strip ends even with bottom crust. Fold crust edge and strips in; press edge with tines of fork to seal. (Feeling ambitious? Click here for tips on making a woven lattice crust.) Whisk cream and sugar in small bowl to blend for glaze. Brush glaze over lattice.
Bake pie 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350°F and continue to bake until crust is golden brown and filling is bubbling, 50 to 60 minutes. Transfer pie to rack and cool completely for filling to set. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Let stand at room temperature 2 hours before serving. If desired, rewarm pie in 325°F oven 10 to 15 minutes before serving.
Serve pie warm or at room temperature.

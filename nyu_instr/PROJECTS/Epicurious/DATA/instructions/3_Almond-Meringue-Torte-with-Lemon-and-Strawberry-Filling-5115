Make meringues: Position racks in top third and bottom third of oven and preheat to 300°F. Using 9-inch tart pan bottom as guide, trace a circle on each of 2 sheets of parchment paper. Place papers, marked side down, on baking sheets.
Blend 1/4 cup sugar, whole almonds and cornstarch in processor until nuts are finely ground. {Step One} Using electric mixer, beat egg whites and salt in large bowl until soft peaks form. Add remaining 3/4 cup sugar by tablespoonfuls, beating until meringue is stiff and glossy. Fold almond mixture into meringue.
{Step Two} Spoon meringue into large pastry bag fitted with 1/2-inch-diameter plain tip. {Step Three} Starting in center of 1 circle marked on parchment and holding tip just above paper, pipe meringue in continuous spiral to fill circle completely. Repeat with remaining circle and meringue, forming 2 rounds.
Bake meringues until pale golden and just firm to touch, about 30 minutes, switching position of pans after 20 minutes. Cool on pans on racks.
Make buttercream: Combine sugar, egg whites and salt in large stainless steel bowl. Set bowl over saucepan of barely simmering water (do not allow bottom of bowl to touch water); whisk constantly until thermometer registers 135°F, about 5 minutes; remove from over water. Using electric mixer, beat until firm peaks form and mixture is completely cool, about 6 minutes. Beat in butter, 1 piece at a time. Gradually beat in lemon juice. (If buttercream appears curdled, place bowl over low heat for several seconds. Remove from heat; beat until smooth. Repeat warming and beating as necessary.) Whisk cream to firm peaks; whisk into buttercream.
Peel parchment off meringues. Using 9-inch tart pan bottom as guide, trim meringues. Place dabs of buttercream on tart pan bottom; top with 1 meringue. Spread 3/4 cup buttercream over meringue; top with strawberry slices. Spread 3/4 cup buttercream over berry slices. Top with second meringue. Spread remaining buttercream over top and sides of torte. Press sliced almonds into buttercream. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Let stand at room temperature 30 minutes before continuing.)
Cut reserved whole strawberries into quarters. Arrange atop torte.

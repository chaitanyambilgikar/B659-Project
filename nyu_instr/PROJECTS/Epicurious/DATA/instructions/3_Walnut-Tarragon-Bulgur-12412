In a small bowl stir together shallot, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and vinegar and let mixture stand while cooking bulgur.
In a small heavy saucepan bring water with remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt to a boil. Stir in bulgur and cook, covered, over low heat 10 to 12 minutes, or until water is absorbed. Transfer bulgur to a large bowl and cool completely, stirring occasionally with a fork to break up lumps. Stir in shallot mixture, tarragon, oil, walnuts, and salt and pepper to taste.

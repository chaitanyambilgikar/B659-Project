Trim fennel stalks flush with bulbs, reserving stalks for another use, and trim any discolorations from bulbs. Cut bulbs lengthwise in half or into quarters. Cut out most of cores, leaving enough to keep pieces intact, and discard cores.
In a 12-inch heavy skillet warm oil over moderate heat and cook garlic until pale golden. Discard garlic and cook fennel, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Add 1/2 cup broth or water and salt to taste and simmer, partially covered, stirring occasionally and adding more liquid if necessary, until fennel is very tender and golden brown, about 20 minutes (sauce should be syrupy and golden).

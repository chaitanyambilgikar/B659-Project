Bring a large pot of water to a simmer. Add the celery, onion, leek, peppercorns, bay leaf, wine and lemon and simmer for 25 minutes.
Then add the salmon. Cover the pot, remove it from the heat, and let it stand for 10 minutes.
Remove the salmon and chill it in the refrigerator. Discard the vegetable water.
In a food processor or by hand, whip with salmon with the crème fraîche, chives, and olive oil, and add salt and pepper to taste. Keep the spread chilled until you're ready to serve.

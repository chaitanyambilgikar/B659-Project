Preheat oven to 400°F. Place squash cubes on rimmed baking sheet. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, then pour 1 tablespoon olive oil over and toss to coat. Roast 10 minutes.

Transfer mussels to large bowl. Cover liquid in skillet and set aside. Remove mussels from shells; discard shells. Pour clam juice and any accumulated juices from mussels into liquid in skillet. Bring to boil; reduce heat to medium and simmer until reduced to 1/2 cup, about 5 minutes. Whisk in 2 tablespoons oil. Cover; set aside.
Meanwhile, cook linguine in large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally.
Using tongs, transfer pasta to skillet with juices, reserving pasta cooking liquid in pot. Add mussels and squash to skillet; toss. Add spinach to pasta cooking liquid; let stand 1 minute to wilt. Drain spinach.

In a steamer set over boiling water steam the squash, covered, for 15 minutes, or until it is very tender. Reserve the steaming liquid and in a food processor purée the squash with the butter, the maple syrup, and enough of the reserved steaming liquid to reach the desired consistency. Season the squash purée with salt and pepper. The squash purée may be made 3 days in advance, kept covered and chilled, and reheated, adding additional water as needed.

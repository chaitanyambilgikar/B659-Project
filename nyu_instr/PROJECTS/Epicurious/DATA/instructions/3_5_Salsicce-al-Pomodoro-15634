Divide the sausage into links, if necessary, and prick them in several places with the point of a sharp knife. Arrange the links in a deep 10-inch skillet or sauté pan and place over medium heat with the olive oil. Turn the sausage in the hot pan and, as some fat accumulates, increase the heat slightly and brown the sausage lightly all over. This takes about 10 minutes, adjusting the heat as necessary so the fat and the eventual brown film in the pan do not burn. Pour or spoon off all the fat in the pan.
Pass the tomatoes through a food mill directly into the pan with the sausage. Season with hot pepper flakes. Salt is generally not necessary because the sausages are well seasoned. Simmer gently for 30 to 35 minutes, until the sausages are cooked through and the sauce has thickened.
Use the sauce for spaghetti or ziti (there should be enough for 12 ounces) and pass the grated cheese. Serve the sausage as a separate course with broccoli, broccoli di rapa, spinach, or another green vegetable.

Make sauce: Coat and cook fish: Preheat oven to 450°F with rack in middle.
Put flour, egg, and coconut in separate shallow bowls. Dredge curved side of each fillet in flour, shaking off excess, then dip floured side in egg and then in coconut. (Discard marinade.)
Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in an ovenproof heavy medium skillet over medium heat until it shimmers. Cook fish, coated side down, until coconut is pale golden, 30 to 60 seconds. Carefully turn fish over and transfer skillet to oven. Roast until fish is just cooked through, 6 to 7 minutes. Serve fish with sauce.â—Š

Heat oil in a 5- to 6-quart heavy pot over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then sauté onion, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 6 minutes. Add garlic and oregano and sauté, stirring, 1 minute. Add tomatoes with reserved juice, tomato paste, bay leaf, and salt and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until thickened, 30 to 35 minutes. Discard bay leaf.
Form and fry meatballs: Stir together bread crumbs and milk in a large bowl and let stand 10 minutes. Add meat, garlic, cheese, egg, parsley, salt, and pepper and blend with your hands until just combined well (do not overmix). Form level 1/2-teaspoon portions into meatballs (you should have about 135).
Heat oil in a 10-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat until hot but not smoking, then fry meatballs in 5 batches (do not crowd), turning occasionally, until browned well and cooked through, about 2 minutes per batch. Transfer as browned to paper towels using a slotted spoon.
Make filling: Stir together all filling ingredients until combined well.
Boil and bake Pasta: Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 425°F.
Cook pasta in a 6- to 8-quart pot of boiling salted water, uncovered, until al dente. Drain in a colander, then rinse under cold water and drain again.
Spread 2 cups sauce in a 13- by 9-inch or other 3-quart glass or ceramic baking dish and arrange one third of fettuccine over sauce, then top with all of meatballs. Make another layer each of 2 cups sauce and one third of fettuccine, then spread with all of filling. Top with remaining fettuccine, then remaining sauce. Sprinkle evenly with mozzarella.
Bake, loosely covered with foil, 10 minutes. Remove foil and bake until sauce is bubbling and cheese is golden, about 20 minutes more. Transfer to a rack and cool, about 20 minutes.

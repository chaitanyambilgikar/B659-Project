Halve carrot pieces lengthwise and cut crosswise into 1/8-inch-thick slices. In a heavy medium skillet heat oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and stir-fry carrots until they begin to turn golden. Add garlic and stir-fry 30 seconds. Add water and butter and simmer, covered, until carrots are just tender, about 3 minutes. Boil carrots, uncovered, until most of liquid is evaporated. Stir in lemon juice and salt and pepper to taste.

Repeat with remaining zucchini, forming 12 ribbons total. Place lobster or shrimp at 1 end of each zucchini ribbon, dividing lobster or shrimp equally. Top with sprouts and pickled ginger, dividing equally. Starting at filled end, roll up each zucchini ribbon into cylinder. Place seam side down on paper-towel-lined baking sheet. Cover and chill at least 1 hour or up to 6 hours.

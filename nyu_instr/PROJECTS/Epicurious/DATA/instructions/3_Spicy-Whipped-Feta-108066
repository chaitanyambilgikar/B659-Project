1. Crumble the feta. Place it in the bowl of a food processor and pulse together with the yogurt until smooth.
2. Add the olive oil and pepper, and continue working the mixture until it becomes very soft and spreadable. Remove and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
3. Just before serving, spike the flavor to taste with lemon juice.

1. Split the tomatoes in half and squeeze the halves into a sieve over a small bowl to remove juice and seeds. Press the mixture in the sieve and reserve the liquid and the pulp.
2. Puree the tomatoes in a food processor and pass through a food mill or strainer to remove the skins. (Or peel, seed, juice, and process tomatoes until smooth if you don't have a food mill.) Add the reserved juice to the pulp and measure 2 1/4 cups of tomato.
3. Sprinkle the gelatin over 1/4 cup tomato pulp in a medium-sized bowl, stir, and soak for 3 minutes. Heat 1/2 cup tomato pulp until boiling, add to the softened gelatin, and stir in to dissolve the gelatin. Add the rest of the tomato pulp, the basil, garlic, hot pepper, salt, and extra virgin olive oil. Divide the mixture into 6 lightly oiled 1/2-cup molds for at least 3 hours. unmold and top with a drizzle of extra virgin.

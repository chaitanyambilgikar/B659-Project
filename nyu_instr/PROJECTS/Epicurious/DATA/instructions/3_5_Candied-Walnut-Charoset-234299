Line large baking sheet with parchment paper. In medium bowl, whisk together sugar and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon.
In large heavy skillet over moderately high heat, heat oil to 350°F. Fry walnuts until golden brown, about 30 seconds, being careful not to burn. Using skimmer or slotted spoon, transfer walnuts from skillet to bowl containing sugar mixture. Toss walnuts in sugar, then spread on baking sheet. Cool 15 minutes, then chop roughly.
In large bowl, combine nuts, remaining 1 teaspoon cinnamon, apples, and wine. Store, covered, at room temperature until ready to serve.

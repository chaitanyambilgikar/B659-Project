In a small bowl whisk together cornmeal, flour, baking soda, and salt. In a bowl whisk together egg, buttermilk, and cream cheese. Chop half of corn coarse and stir into buttermilk mixture with remaining corn, chives, peperoncini, salmon, and cornmeal mixture until just combined.
In a large non-stick skillet heat oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and, working in batches, drop batter by 1/4-cup measures into skillet. Spread batter slightly to form 3 1/2- to 4-inch cakes and cook 2 to 3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown. Transfer corncakes as cooked to a heatproof platter and keep warm. Serve corncakes with sour cream, chopped red onion, and lemon slices.

Preheat oven to 350° F. In a shallow baking pan spread pecans evenly and toast in middle of oven until fragrant and a shade darker, 5 to 6 minutes. Cool pecans and finely chop.
In a bowl combine well brown sugar, cornstarch, and salt and whisk in eggs until combined. In a 2 1/2- to 3-quart heavy saucepan bring milk just to a boil. Add hot milk to egg mixture in a slow stream, whisking, and pour into pan. Bring custard to a boil over moderate heat, whisking constantly, and boil, whisking, 1 minute. Stir in vanilla. (Custard will appear curdled.)
Chill custard until cold and stir in cream. Freeze custard, in batches if necessary, in an ice-cream maker. Transfer ice cream to a large bowl and stir in pecans. Transfer ice cream to an airtight container and put in freezer to harden. Ice cream may be made 1 week ahead.

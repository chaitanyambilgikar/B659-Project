1. Cut a gash in the side of each frankfurter. Spread prepared mustard inside; add a strip of cheese and push the frankfurter back in shape. Wrap a strip of bacon around it. Fasten with a toothpick. Grill until cheese melts and bacon is crisp.
2. Cut gashes in the frankfurters and spread the inside with garlic butter to which you have added chopped chives and parsley. Wrap with bacon strips and grill.
3. Mash blue cheese with a little grated onion and blend in chopped chives and parsley. Gash the frankfurters and stuff them with this mixture. Wrap with bacon strips and grill.
4. Cut frankfurters in 1-inch pieces. Alternate these on skewers with tiny whole tomatoes and strips of green pepper. Grill. Serve with a good hot Mexican chili.

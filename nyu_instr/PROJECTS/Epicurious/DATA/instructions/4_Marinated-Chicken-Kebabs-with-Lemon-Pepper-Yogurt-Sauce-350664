1. For the kebabs: in a plastic bag or airtight container, combine olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, rosemary, and thyme. Add chicken, toss well to coat evenly, and refrigerate overnight.
2. For the sauce, combine all ingredients in a mixing bowl and refrigerate at least 2 hours.
3. Remove chicken pieces from marinade and season well with salt and pepper. Grill chicken for 5 minutes on each side, until golden brown and juices of chicken run clear when pricked with the end of the skewer. Thread 3 pieces of chicken onto each skewer. Serve with Lemon-Pepper Yogurt Sauce.

Peel and devein shrimp. Halve shrimp lengthwise and in a bowl season with salt. Finely chop onion. Trim fennel stalks flush with bulb, reserving fronds and discarding stalks, and trim any discolored outer layers. Halve bulb lengthwise and discard core. Finely chop bulb. Finely chop enough reserved fronds to measure about 2 tablespoons.
In a 1 1/2-quart saucepan bring broth and water to a simmer and keep at a bare simmer.
In a 2-quart heavy saucepan cook onion and fennel bulb in butter over moderately low heat, stirring, until softened. Add rice and cook, stirring, 2 minutes. Increase heat to moderate and add wine. Cook mixture, stirring, 1 minute. Stir in 1/2 cup simmering broth and cook, stirring constantly and keeping at a strong simmer, until broth is absorbed. Continue cooking and adding broth, about 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly and letting each addition be absorbed before adding next, until rice is tender and creamy-looking but still al dente, 18 to 20 minutes total. (There will be broth left over.)
Stir shrimp into risotto and cook, stirring constantly, until shrimp are just cooked through, about 3 minutes. If desired, thin risotto to desired consistency with some leftover broth.
Stir in fennel fronds if using and salt and pepper to taste and serve risotto immediately.

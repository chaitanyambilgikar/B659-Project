Preheat oven to 350°F and butter and flour a 12-cup bundt pan, knocking out excess flour.
Sift together flour, baking soda, and salt. Whisk together oil, eggs, sugars, spices, rum, and vanilla in a large bowl. Fold in flour mixture until just combined. Fold in apples and raisins and spoon batter into pan.
Bake in middle of oven until a tester comes out clean, about 1 1/4 hours.
Cool cake in pan on a rack 10 minutes, then turn out onto rack to cool completely.

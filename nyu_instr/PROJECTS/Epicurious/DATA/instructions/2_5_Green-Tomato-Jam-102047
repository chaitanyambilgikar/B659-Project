Remove the stem end of the tomatoes and cut into dice. Mix with the sugar and let stand for 3 hours to draw juices. Combine tomato mixture and remaining ingredients in a large pot and cook over low heat until the tomatoes are translucent and the juices are thickened. Discard cinnamon sticks, ladle the jam into hot, sterilized jelly glasses and cover with a thin layer of paraffin. When the paraffin has hardened, cover the glasses.

Melt 2 tablespoons butter in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add ham; sauté 3 minutes. Add morels; sauté until tender, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat.
Whisk 3 eggs in bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in 7- to 8-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Pour eggs into skillet; stir with rubber spatula until eggs begin to set, about 1 minute. Sprinkle half of morel mixture and half of Brie over eggs. Cook until eggs are softly set, tilting skillet to cook eggs evenly, about 2 minutes longer. Fold omelet in half; transfer to plate. Repeat with remaining ingredients.

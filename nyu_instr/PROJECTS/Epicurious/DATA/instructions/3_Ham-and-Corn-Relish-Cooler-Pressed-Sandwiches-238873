1. Spread the relish along both halves of the baguette.
2. Divide the ham evenly along the length.
3. Close the baguette and wrap it tightly in waxed paper, then in aluminum foil.
4. Place the sandwich at the bottom of the cooler so the weight of the other contents compresses the sandwich and allows the juices to soak into the bread.

Preheat oven to 450°F. Place crust on baking sheet. Spread with pesto, leaving 1/2-inch plain border. Top evenly with crabmeat, artichokes, olives, and crushed red pepper. Heat oil in heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add bell pepper and sauté until just tender, about 5 minutes; arrange pepper slices on pizza. Sprinkle cheese over. Bake pizza until crust is brown and crisp on bottom and topping is heated through, about 15 minutes. Transfer pizza to work surface; cut into wedges.

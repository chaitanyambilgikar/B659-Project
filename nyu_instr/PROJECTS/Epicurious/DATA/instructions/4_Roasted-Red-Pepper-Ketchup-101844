Combine tomatoes with juices and all remaining ingredients in heavy large saucepan over high heat. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until reduced to about 3 cups, about 30 minutes. Discard bay leaf. Working in batches, purée ketchup in blender until smooth. Season with salt and pepper. Cool slightly, then chill until cold. (Ketchup can be prepared 1 week ahead. Cover and keep refrigerated.)

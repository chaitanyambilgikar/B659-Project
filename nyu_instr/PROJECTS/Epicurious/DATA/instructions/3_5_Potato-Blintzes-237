Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions and sugar. Cover skillet and cook until onions are well browned, stirring frequently, 20 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
Meanwhile, place potatoes on vegetable steamer rack and steam in covered pot over boiling water until tender, about 15 minutes. Transfer potatoes to large bowl. Add milk and mash until almost smooth. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Mix in half of onions. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover potato filling and remaining onions separately and chill. Rewarm onions before serving.)
Place 1 egg roll wrapper on work surface. Brush edges with egg white. Arrange 1/3 cup scant of potato filling in 3-inch log horizontally just below center. Fold bottom of dough over filling. Fold sides over. Roll up wrapper to enclose filling completely. Repeat with remaining filling and wrappers.
Heat 1/2 tablespoon vegetable oil in heavy large nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Add half of blintzes, seam side down, and fry until heated through and golden brown and crisp on all 4 sides, about 10 minutes. Drain blintzes briefly on paper towels. Repeat with remaining blintzes.
Arrange blintzes on plates. Place dollop of yogurt and spoonful of remaining onions alongside and then serve immediately.

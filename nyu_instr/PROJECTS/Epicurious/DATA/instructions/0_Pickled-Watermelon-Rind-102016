Scrape off any pink flesh from rind. Cut rind into 3/4" squares. Cover with cold, salted water (1/4 cup salt to 1 quart water), and leave overnight. Drain, cover with fresh water and cook 1/2 hour, or until just tender. Drain again. Stir together sugar, vinegar and water in a large preserving kettle. Slice oranges and lemons thinly, discard pits and add fruit to the pot. Tie cinnamon, cloves and allspice in a cheesecloth bag and add to the pot. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly until the sugar dissolves. Add watermelon rind and cook for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, or until the rind is translucent and the juices syrupy. Ladle into hot, sterilized preserving jars. Open cheesecloth, place a piece of cinnamon in each jar, cover and seal.

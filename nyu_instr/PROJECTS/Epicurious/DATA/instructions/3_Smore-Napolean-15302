Whip cream. Melt white chocolate in top of a double boiler or in microwave. Stir milk into melted white chocolate to combine and allow to cool; fold into whipped cream. Reserve.
Break one graham cracker in half. Place three squares of Hershey's chocolate bar on each half and cook in microwave for 45 seconds, or until the chocolate begins to melt. Remove from microwave and place a marshmallow on top of the chocolate on each graham cracker half. Return to microwave for 15 seconds or until the marshmallow begins to inflate. Remove from microwave and top each with another half graham cracker. Press down to set. Top with a dollop of white chocolate mousse and repeat for more s'mores.

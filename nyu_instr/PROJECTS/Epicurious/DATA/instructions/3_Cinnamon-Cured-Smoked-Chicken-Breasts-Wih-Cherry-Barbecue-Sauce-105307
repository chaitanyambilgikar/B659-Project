Whisk 4 cups water, coarse salt, and sugar in large bowl until sugar dissolves. Add chicken breasts, sliced onion, lemon slices, and broken cinnamon sticks. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate 1 hour.
Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Place wood chips in 8x6-inch foil packet left open at top; set packet atop coals 5 minutes before grilling chicken. Remove chicken from marinade; discard marinade. Grill chicken until just cooked through, about 8 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to platter. Serve, passing Cherry Barbecue Sauce separately.

Butter four 2/3-cup soufflé dishes; coat with sugar. Stir water and espresso powder in heavy small saucepan until espresso powder dissolves. Add chocolate and brandy. Stir over low heat until mixture is smooth. Remove from heat. Whisk in yolks. Cool to room temperature.
Beat egg whites in large bowl until foamy. Gradually add 2 1/2 tablespoons sugar and beat until medium-firm peaks form. Fold chocolate mixture into whites. Divide among soufflé dishes. Place on baking sheet. (Can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand uncovered at room temperature.)
Preheat oven to 400°F. Bake soufflés until puffed but still moist in center, about 14 minutes. Dust soufflés with powdered sugar. Serve immediately, passing White Chocolate Cream separately.

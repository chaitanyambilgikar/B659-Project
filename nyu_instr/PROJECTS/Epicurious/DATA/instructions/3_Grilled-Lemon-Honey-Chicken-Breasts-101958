Place chicken breasts in shallow dish. Mix onion, lemon juice, vegetable oil, honey and soy sauce in small bowl. Pour 1/2 cup onion mixture over chicken; turn to coat. Let stand 1 hour at room temperature or refrigerate up to 4 hours.
Pour remaining onion mixture into small saucepan. Boil until slightly reduced and thickened, about 2 minutes; reserve for glaze.
Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Brush grill rack with oil. Remove chicken from marinade, shaking off excess. Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper. Grill chicken until cooked through, brushing occasionally with reserved marinade glaze, about 8 minutes per side. Transfer to plates and serve.

Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking. Drain very well. Set pasta aside.
Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add bell pepper, thyme, garlic and crushed red pepper; sauté 2 minutes. Add ground turkey to pot. Sauté turkey until cooked through, breaking up turkey with back of fork, about 5 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer turkey mixture to large bowl.
Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in same pot over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms and green onions and sautâ€© until mushrooms are tender and brown, about 6 minutes. Add turkey mixture, broth, 1 1/2 cups Parmesan cheese, wine and pasta. Cook until sauce thickens enough to coat pasta, tossing often, about 3 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve, passing remaining Parmesan cheese separately.

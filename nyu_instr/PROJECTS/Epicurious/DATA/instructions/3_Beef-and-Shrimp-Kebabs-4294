Alternate 2 pieces each of beef, shrimp, bell pepper, onion and cherry tomatoes on each skewer. Place kebabs in 13x9x2-inch glass baking dish. Combine dressing and garlic in small bowl. Pour 1/2 cup dressing mixture over kebabs. Let stand 30 minutes, turning occasionally.
Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Grill kebabs until beef is medium-rare and shrimp are opaque in center, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer to platter. Pass remaining dressing separately.

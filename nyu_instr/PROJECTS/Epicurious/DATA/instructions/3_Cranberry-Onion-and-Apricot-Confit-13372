Stir in the vinegar, the water, the cranberries, and the salt and cook the mixture, stirring, for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the berries have burst and are softened. Stir in the apricots and cook the confit for 1 minute. The confit keeps, covered and chilled, for 2 weeks. Serve the confit warm or at room temperature.

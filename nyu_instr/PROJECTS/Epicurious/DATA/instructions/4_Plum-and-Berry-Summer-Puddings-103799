Line six 3/4-cup custard cups with plastic wrap, leaving 3-inch overhang on all sides. Using 3-inch cookie cutter, cut out 1 round from each bread slice; reserve.
Combine plums and sugar in heavy medium saucepan. Stir over medium-low heat until sugar dissolves and syrup forms. Simmer until plums are tender and translucent, stirring often, about 5 minutes. Add all berries; simmer until berries release their juices, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Stir in lemon juice. Cool to room temperature.
Arrange 2 cooked plum slices in bottom of each custard cup. Top plums in each with 2 tablespoons fruit mixture with juices, then 1 bread round. Top each with remaining fruit mixture with juices, dividing equally. Place 1 bread round atop each; press into fruit mixture to compact. Cover puddings tightly with plastic-wrap overhang. Place custard cups on baking sheet. Top cups with another baking sheet. Place several food cans on top baking sheet to weigh down. Chill overnight. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Keep chilled.).
Unfold plastic wrap from top of custard cups. Invert puddings onto plates. Remove plastic wrap. Spoon whipped cream alongside and serve.

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Combine mayonnaise and pesto in small bowl; whisk to blend. Cut bread horizontally in half. Brush chicken lightly with oil; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill chicken until just cooked through, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to cutting board; cool slightly. Cut chicken on sharp diagonal into 1/2-inch-thick slices.
Spread pesto mayonnaise onto cut surfaces of bread. Layer chicken, mozzarella, artichokes, tomato, and greens onto bottom halves. Top with bread tops.
* An Italian flatbread available at many bakeries and supermarkets.

For fritters: Mix first 5 ingredients in medium bowl. Whisk buttermilk and egg in small bowl to blend. Stir egg mixture into dry ingredients, then stir in corn kernels, onion, and bell pepper (do not overmix).
Pour enough oil into large skillet to coat bottom. Heat oil over medium heat. Working in batches, drop 1 scant tablespoon batter for each fritter into hot skillet; spread each to 2-inch round. Fry until golden, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to baking sheet. (Can be made ahead. Let stand at room temperature up to 2 hours or cover and chill overnight. Bake uncovered in 350°F oven until heated through, 6 to 8 minutes.)
For crème fraîche: Place crabmeat in medium bowl. Fold in crème fraîche, 1/4 cup chives, white pepper, and cayenne. Season with salt. (Can be made 2 hours ahead. Cover; chill. Stir before using.)
Arrange warm fritters on platter. Top with crab mixture and garnish with additional chives.

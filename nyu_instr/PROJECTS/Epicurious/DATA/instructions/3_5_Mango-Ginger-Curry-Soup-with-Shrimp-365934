Pulse mangoes, shallots, garlic, ginger, curry powder and salt in a food processor until pureed. Add coconut milk; pulse until well combined. Transfer mango mixture to a bowl; stir in coconut water and lime juice. (Thin with tap water if desired.) Cover and chill until cold, 1 hour. Divide among 4 bowls; garnish with shrimp and cilantro before serving.

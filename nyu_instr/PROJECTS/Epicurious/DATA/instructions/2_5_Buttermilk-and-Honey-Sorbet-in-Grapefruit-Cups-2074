For Sorbet: Stir in honey in medium saucepan over low heat until warm. Remove honey from heat. Whisk in buttermilk and corn syrup. Refrigerate buttermilk mixture until cold.
Transfer buttermilk mixture to ice cream maker and process according to manufacturer's instructions. Transfer sorbet to covered container and freeze. (Can be prepared 3 days ahead. Keep frozen.)
For Grapefruit Cups: Using small sharp knife, cut around grapefruit to loosen pulp. Remove pulp from grapefruit and reserve for another use. Refrigerate grapefruit shells. (Can be made 6 hours ahead. Cover and keep refrigerated.)
For Fried Herbs: Pour vegetable oil into heavy large skillet to depth of 1 inch. Heat to 375°F. Working in batches, add mint and sage sprigs to skillet; fry until beginning to crisp but not brown, about 30 seconds. Using slotted spoon, carefully transfer herb sprigs to paper towels; drain. Sprinkle herb sprigs with sugar to coat lightly.
Scoop sorbet into each grapefruit cup. Garnish with sugared herb sprigs and serve.

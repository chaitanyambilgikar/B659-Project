Cook potatoes and garlic in large pot of boiling salted water until potatoes are very tender, about 15 minutes. Drain; return potatoes and garlic to same pot.
Meanwhile, melt 1/2 cup butter in heavy small saucepan over medium heat. Add chopped prosciutto and 3/4 teaspoon minced rosemary and sauté until fragrant, about 2 minutes.
Add prosciutto mixture and 3/4 cup milk to potatoes and garlic. Mash well, adding more milk by tablespoonfuls if potatoes are dry. Mix in 3/4 cup cheese. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 6 hours ahead. Cover and chill. Stir over low heat to rewarm, adding more milk by tablespoonfuls, if desired.) Transfer potatoes to bowl. Sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup cheese; garnish with fresh rosemary and serve.

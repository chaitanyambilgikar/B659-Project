Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 425°F. Sauté sausage in large skillet over medium-high heat until just cooked through, breaking into 1/2-inch pieces with back of spoon, about 10 minutes. Drain off fat; set sausage aside.
Place pizza crust on rimless baking sheet. Leaving 3/4-inch plain border, spread 1 cup sauce over crust. Top with 3/4 cup mozzarella, 3/4 of basil, sausage, 1/2 cup Gorgonzola, olives, 1/2 cup mozzarella, bell pepper and 1/2 cup Gorgonzola. Drizzle remaining 1/4 cup sauce over. Bake pizza until crust is crisp and topping is heated through, about 13 minutes. Sprinkle with remaining basil.

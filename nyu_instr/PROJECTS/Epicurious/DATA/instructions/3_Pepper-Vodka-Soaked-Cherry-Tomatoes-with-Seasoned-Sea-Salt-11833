Poke 5 or 6 holes with a wooden pick or skewer in each tomato and put in a shallow bowl. Pour vodka over tomatoes and let stand, covered, tossing occasionally, 1 to 2 hours, or until soaked to desired taste.
In a small bowl stir together salt and pepper.
Serve tomatoes with seasoned salt for dipping.

Heat oven to 400°F. Pour 1/2 the lemon juice into a mug or bowl and stir in cornstarch. Rub inside of a saucepan with garlic; cut clove halves into pieces and add to pan. Add broth, kirsch and nutmeg. Bring to a slow boil over medium-high heat. Add cheeses. Reduce heat to medium, stirring until cheese melts, 2 to 3 minutes. (Mixture will separate.) Stir in juice-cornstarch mixture, cooking until sauce comes together, 30 seconds. Stir in pasta and spoon into 8 small ramekins or espresso cups. Top with breadcrumbs; transfer to a baking sheet. Bake, uncovered, until tops bubble, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from oven; transfer ramekins to a wire rack to cool, 4 to 5 minutes. Toss arugula, remaining lemon juice and pepper in a bowl. Top each mac 'n' cheese with salad.

Preheat oven to 325°F.
In a large heavy skillet melt butter over moderate heat and stir in bread crumbs. Cook bread crumbs, stirring constantly and breaking up lumps, until golden, about 5 minutes.
In a 1 1/2-quart soufflé dish layer 1 cup crumbs, 2 cups applesauce, and 1/2 cup preserves and repeat. Sprinkle remaining 1/2 cup crumbs on top and bake pudding in middle of oven 25 minutes, or until top is golden brown. Pudding may be made 1 day in advance and kept covered and chilled. Reheat pudding in a 325°F. oven before serving. Garnish pudding with whipped cream and additional preserves.
Serve pudding warm with whipped cream.
To make chunky applesauce: Peel and core apples and cut into 3/4-inch pieces. In a large heavy saucepan bring water, apples, and sugar to a boil and simmer, stirring occasionally, until apples are soft and starting to fall apart, about 25 minutes. Applesauce may be made 3 days in advance and kept covered and chilled. Makes about 5 cups.

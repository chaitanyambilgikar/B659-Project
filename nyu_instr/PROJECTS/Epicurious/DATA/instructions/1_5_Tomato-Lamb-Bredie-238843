1. Place 2 1/2 tablespoons of the oil in a large Dutch oven, Crock Pot, or cast-iron stew pot over medium heat. Add the onions, bay leaves, and cinnamon sticks and sauté, stirring constantly for about 10 minutes, or until golden. Remove from the pot and set aside.
2. Dust the meat with flour and divide it into two batches. Add 1 tablespoon of oil to the pot over medium heat, add the first batch of meat, and brown on all sides, approximately 5 minutes. Remove the browned meat from the pot and set aside. Add the remaining tablespoon of oil to the pot and repeat the browning process for the second batch. Remove excess grease from the pot by using a large ladle or spoon.
3. Add the white wine to the pot, reduce the heat, and deglaze using a wooden spoon. Return the reserved meat and the onions, bay leaves, and cinnamon stick to the pot. Add the tomato, crushed garlic, salt and pepper, chili, and tomato paste. Cover the pot and simmer over medium heat for 40 minutes, stirring from time to time. Add the potatoes and sugar, and cook until tender, about 20 minutes. Remove the lid from the pot, stir, and cook, for a final 15 minutes. Garnish with chopped parsley or cilantro and serve the bredie hot with rice on the side.

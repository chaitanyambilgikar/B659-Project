Cook beans in large pot of boiling salted water until crisp-tender, about 4 minutes. Drain well. Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add orange peel, lemon peel, and garlic and stir 1 minute. Add broth and simmer 1 minute. Add butter and beans. Toss until beans are heated through and sauce coats beans, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and serve.

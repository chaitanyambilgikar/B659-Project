Into a bowl grate 3 large potatoes, peeled, and squeeze them in 2 batches in a tea towel to remove the moisture. In another bowl combine the potatoes with 1 onion and 1 small carrot, both grated, and toss the mixture with 1/2 cup flour, 2 eggs, lightly beaten, 3/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. In an 8-inch pie tin render 3 tablespoons chicken fat, add the potato mixture, and smooth it with a spatula. Bake the kugel in a preheated moderately hot oven (375°F.) for 45 to 50 minutes, or until it is golden. Serve the kugel cut into wedges.

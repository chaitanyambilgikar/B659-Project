Preheat oven to 500°F.
Cut potatoes into 1/2-inch pieces and in a large bowl toss potatoes and asparagus gently with 1 1/2 teaspoons oil until coated well. Spread vegetables in 2 shallow baking pans and roast in upper and lower thirds of oven switching position of pans halfway through roasting, 15 minutes or until crisp-tender and pale golden. Transfer vegetables to a platter and drizzle with vinegar and remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons oil. Sprinkle vegetables with salt and pepper.

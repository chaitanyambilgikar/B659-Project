Preheat oven to 400°F. Grease 5- by 1 1/2-inch corn-stick molds generously with shortening and on a baking sheet heat in oven for 10 minutes.
While molds are heating, in a large bowl whisk together eggs, butter, oil, and yogurt. In a bowl whisk together remaining ingredients. Add flour mixture to egg mixture and combine batter well.
Remove molds from oven carefully and pour 1/4 cup batter into each mold. Bake corn sticks in batches in middle of oven until a tester comes out clean, about 15 to 17 minutes, and remove from molds. Corn sticks may be made 3 days in advance and kept chilled in resealable plastic bags. Reheat corn sticks on a baking sheet in 400°F. oven about 5 minutes.

Split open chile and discard stem and seeds. Heat a dry small heavy skillet over moderate heat until hot, then toast chile until fragrant, 5 to 10 seconds on each side. Finely chop chile.
Line rack of a broiler pan with foil and lightly oil, then set aside. Preheat broiler.
Pat fish dry, then brush both sides with 1 tablespoon oil (total) and sprinkle with sea salt. Broil fillets, skin sides up, about 5 inches from heat 9 minutes (skin will be browned and blistered). Turn fish over and broil until flesh is opaque (just cooked through), 1 to 2 minutes more.
Transfer fish to a platter and sprinkle with vinegar, parsley, and chopped chile.
Heat remaining 1/3 cup oil in small heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then sauté garlic, stirring, until golden, about 1 minute. Drizzle oil with garlic over fish and serve immediately.

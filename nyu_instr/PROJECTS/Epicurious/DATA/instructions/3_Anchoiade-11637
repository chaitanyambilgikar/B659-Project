In a food processor grind fine almonds with anchovies and garlic. With motor running add shallot, oil, vinegar, and herbes de Provence and blend well. Add tomato, bell pepper, and parsley and pulse motor until just combined, being careful not to purée smooth. Anchoïade may be made 1 day in advance and kept covered and chilled.
Serve anchoïade at room temperature on toasts.

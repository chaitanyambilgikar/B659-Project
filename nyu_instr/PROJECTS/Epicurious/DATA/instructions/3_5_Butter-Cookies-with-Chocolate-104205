Combine butter and sugar in large bowl. Using electric mixer, beat until light and fluffy. Mix in water and both extracts. Beat in flour and salt until well blended. Stir in chopped chocolate.
Divide dough in half. Form each half into 1 1/2-inch-diameter log. Wrap each log in waxed paper; chill about 2 hours. (Can be made 3 days ahead. Keep chilled.)
Position rack in center of oven; preheat to 350°F. Cut dough into 1/3-inch-thick slices. Place slices on large baking sheets, spacing about 2 inches apart. Bake until cookies begin to turn golden around edges but are still pale in color, about 15 minutes. Transfer baking sheets to racks; cool 5 minutes. Transfer cookies to racks; cool completely. (Can be made 3 days ahead. Store in airtight containers at room temperature.)

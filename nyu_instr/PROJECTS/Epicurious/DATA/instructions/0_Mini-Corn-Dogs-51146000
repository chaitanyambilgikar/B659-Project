1. In a medium pot, preheat oil to 365°F.
2. In a mixing bowl, stir together cornmeal, flour, sugar, cayenne pepper, chili powder, salt, white pepper, baking powder, and baking soda. {Tip: If you prefer a smoother batter, pulse the cornmeal and flour together in a food processor before stirring in the remaining dry ingredients.} Stir in buttermilk, egg, and honey and gently whisk until no lumps remain. Fold in bacon.
3. Skewer 1 cocktail wiener on each toothpick. Working in small batches, dip and roll wieners in batter until fully coated and then quickly and carefully drop them, toothpick and all, into the hot oil. Fry for 3 to 4 minutes, until golden brown. Drain on paper towels.

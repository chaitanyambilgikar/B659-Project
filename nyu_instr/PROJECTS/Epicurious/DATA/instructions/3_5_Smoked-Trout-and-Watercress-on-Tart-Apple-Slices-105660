Combine apple slices and lemon juice in medium bowl; toss gently to coat. Cut trout fillets lengthwise in half, then cut each half into apple-slice-size pieces. Drain apple slices; place on platter. Top each slice with 1 watercress sprig, then 1 trout piece. Sprinkle with pepper. (Can be made 2 hours ahead. Cover and chill.) Serve.

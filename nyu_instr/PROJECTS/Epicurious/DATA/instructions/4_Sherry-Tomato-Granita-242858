Blend together tomatoes, Sherry, sugar, 1 tablespoon vinegar, and 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and pepper in a blender until smooth. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, pressing on and then discarding solids.
Pour tomato mixture into an 8- to 9-inch nonreactive baking dish and freeze until partially frozen, about 1 hour. Scrape and stir with a fork, crushing any lumps. Continue to freeze, scraping once or twice, until evenly frozen, about 2 hours more.
Cut celery, cucumber, and radishes into fine julienne strips, then toss in a bowl with oil, remaining 1/2 teaspoon vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste.
Serve granita with vegetable julienne.

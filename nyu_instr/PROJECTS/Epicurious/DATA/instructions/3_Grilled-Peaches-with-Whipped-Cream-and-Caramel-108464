Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Arrange peach halves, cut side up, on baking sheet; sprinkle peaches with sugar. Let stand until sugar begins to soften, about 10 minutes. Place peaches on grill, sugared side down. Grill until tender and slightly charred, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer peach halves to plates.
Using electric mixer, beat whipping cream in bowl until peaks form; fold in 1/4 cup warm caramel sauce just until streaks appear. Spoon caramel whipped cream alongside peaches. Serve, passing remaining caramel sauce separately.

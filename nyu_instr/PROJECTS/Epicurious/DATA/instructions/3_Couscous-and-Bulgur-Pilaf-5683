Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat. Add onions and sauté until tender and pale golden, about 10 minutes. Add bulgur and stir to coat. Stir in 1 1/2 cups Vegetable-Herb Broth. Bring to simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer gently until liquid is absorbed and bulgur is tender, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat. Using fork, fluff bulgur. Cover and let stand 8 minutes.
Meanwhile, bring remaining 1/2 cup Vegetable-Herb Broth to simmer in small saucepan. Combine broth, couscous and remaining 1/2 teaspoon oil in large bowl. Stir to blend. Cover tightly and let stand until liquid is absorbed and couscous is tender, about 15 minutes. Fluff with fork.
Mix bulgur into couscous in large bowl. Add parsley, chives and rosemary; toss to combine. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

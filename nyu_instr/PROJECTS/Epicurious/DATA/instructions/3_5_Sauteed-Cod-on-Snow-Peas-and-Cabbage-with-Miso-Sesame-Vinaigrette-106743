Make vinaigrette: Purée all vinaigrette ingredients in a blender until smooth.
Sauté cabbage: Heat oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then sauté garlic until golden, about 30 seconds. Add cabbages and snow peas and sauté until cabbages are wilted and peas are crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and transfer to a bowl, then wipe skillet clean.
Cook fish: Heat oil in skillet over high heat until hot but not smoking, then sauté cod, turning once, until golden and just cooked through, about 6 minutes total.
Divide cabbage among 4 plates, then top with fish and drizzle with some dressing. Serve remainder on the side.

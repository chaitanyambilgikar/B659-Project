Thoroughly wash and dry strawberries and apples. Cut apples and banana into 3/4-inch-thick slices. Arrange all fruits and nuts on a plate. To make chocolate sauce, whisk together cocoa, sugar, and Splenda in a medium-sized bowl. Slowly pour in milk to make a paste. Mix together to remove lumps. Transfer to a medium-sized saucepan and bring to a low boil over low heat, stirring constantly. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla. Transfer chocolate sauce to fondue pot. Place pot over candle or canned heat burner. Slide fruit pieces onto fondue fork or toothpick and dip into sauce. For nuts, spoon sauce onto a plate and dip nuts in sauce by hand.

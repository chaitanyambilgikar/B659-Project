Position racks in upper and lower thirds of oven and preheat to 375°F. Butter muffin cups (if pans are not nonstick, butter liberally or spray with nonstick cooking spray).
In large bowl, whisk together all-purpose and whole-wheat flours, cocoa, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon. Stir in zucchini.
In medium bowl, whisk together eggs and brown sugar. Whisk in sour cream and oil. Fold wet mixture into dry until just combined (do not overmix). Gently fold in cranberries and pecans.
Divide batter among muffin cups, filling each cup 3/4 full. Bake until dark golden on top and toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool in pan on rack 10 minutes, then serve warm or turn out onto rack to cool completely. (Muffins can be made up to 3 days ahead and stored in airtight container at room temperature, or frozen in airtight container up to 2 weeks. Defrost in refrigerator, then rewarm, if desired, wrapped in foil in 300°F oven 7 to 10 minutes.)

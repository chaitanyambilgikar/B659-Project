In a small saucepan combine the syrup with the cranberries, simmer the mixture, covered for 5 minutes, or until the cranberries have burst, and keep the syrup warm, covered. In a bowl stir together the flour, the sugar, the baking soda, the salt, the cinnamon, and the walnuts. In a small bowl stir together the buttermilk, the egg, and 1 tablespoon of the butter, add the buttermilk mixture to the flour mixture, and stir the batter until it is just combined.
Preheat the oven to 200°F. Heat a griddle over moderate heat until it is hot enough to make drops of water scatter over its surface and brush it with the additional butter. Spoon 1/4-cup measures of the batter onto the griddle and cook the pancakes for 1 to 2 minutes on each side, or until they are golden. Transfer the pancakes as they are cooked to a heatproof plate and keep them warm in the oven. Serve the pancakes with the syrup.

Place ingredients in a 2-quart pot (copper is nice but not essential). If you want to duplicate Cesare's paiolo, which is a pot with a rounded bottom, use a copper or stainless-steel bowl, holding the edge with a pot holder.
Beat ingredients with a hand mixer at high speed until foamy. Place over medium heat and continue beating. The mixture will thicken and increase greatly in volume. When mixture feels warm, remove the pot from heat. Continue beating, periodically placing the pot back over heat and quickly removing the pot again once the mixture is warm. Do not overheat it or you will curdle the eggs. Practice makes perfect. When ready, the zabaglione will be thick, foamy, and warm — but not hot — to the touch.

Preheat oven to 450°F. Open crust on work surface. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon flour. Rub flour over crust, rubbing out creases. Arrange floured side down in 9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable sides. Trim and finish edges. Pierce all over with fork. Bake until light brown, about 10 minutes. Cool on rack. Reduce oven temperature to 400°F.
Finely grind slivered almonds in processor. Add remaining 1 tablespoon flour, sugar, 2 tablespoons amaretto and butter and puree. Add egg and process until well blended. Pour into crust. Bake until filling begins to brown and is springy to touch, about 15 minutes. Cool on rack. (Can be prepared 6 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.)
Bring medium pot of water to boil. Add peaches and blanch 30 seconds. Transfer to bowl of cold water, using slotted spoon. Peel peaches. Cut into slices. Drain well. Combine preserves and 1 tablespoon amaretto in heavy small saucepan. Bring to boil, stirring to melt preserves. Boil until slightly thickened, about 30 seconds. Brush some preserves over tart filling. Arrange peaches atop preserves in concentric circles, overlapping slices. Brush with remaining preserves. Can be prepared 3 hours ahead. Store at room temperature.)

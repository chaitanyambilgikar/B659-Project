1. Make sure the fishmonger has removed all of the scales, gills, viscera, and membranes from the fish. Rinse the fish well inside and out, then dry well. Place in a steamproof dish.
2. To make the marinade, in a small bowl, mix together all of the ingredients. Sprinkle the marinade evenly on the inside and outside of the fish.
3. In another small bowl, mix together the pork, sesame oil, soy sauce, and sugar. Sprinkle the mixture over the fish, and let rest for 10 minutes.
4. Prepare a wok for steaming using a cake rack (place a cake rack over boiling water in a wok), place the dish with the fish on the rack, cover, and steam for 12 to 15 minutes, or until a chopstick slides easily into the flesh of the fish.
5. Turn off the heat. Pour the onion oil over the fish and sprinkle with the scallions. Remove the dish from the wok, and serve the fish in its cooking dish.

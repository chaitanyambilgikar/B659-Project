1. Stir 1/2 cup vegetable stock (use a 32-ounce carton and look for a nonfat variety, preferably one low in sodium) with 2 tablespoons cornstarch in a measuring cup until blended (no clumps).
2. Bring 28 ounces leftover stock to a boil in a medium saucepan. Reduce heat to a simmer and slowly whisk in stock-cornstarch mixture. Stir stock rapidly as it thickens.
3. Stir until stock is the consistency of olive oil. (It should cling to the back of a spoon.) Cool to room temperature, skim off and discard any film on top. Makes 18 ounces thickened stock

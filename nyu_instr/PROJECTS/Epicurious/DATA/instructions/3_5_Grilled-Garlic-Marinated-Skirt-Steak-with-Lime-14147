If necessary, trim steaks, leaving some fat. In a shallow dish rub steaks with garlic and oil. Marinate steaks, covered and chilled, at least 30 minutes and up to 1 day.
Prepare grill.
Season steaks generously with coarse salt and grill on a rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals 2 to 3 minutes on each side for medium-rare. (Alternatively, steaks may be broiled on rack of a broiler pan under a preheated broiler 3 inches from heat about 4 minutes on each side.) Transfer steaks to a cutting board and drizzle with lime juice. Let steaks stand, uncovered, 5 to 10 minutes and with a sharp knife cut diagonally across grain into thin slices.
Serve steak with accompaniments.

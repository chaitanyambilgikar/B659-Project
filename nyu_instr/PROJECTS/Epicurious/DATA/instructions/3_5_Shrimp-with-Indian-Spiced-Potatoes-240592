Toss shrimp with 1/4 teaspoon salt. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large heavy nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until hot, then cook half of ginger and half of garlic, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add shrimp and cook, stirring, until just cooked through, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a dish and cover.
Wipe skillet clean and heat remaining 1/4 cup oil over medium-high heat until hot, then cook remaining ginger and garlic, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add spices and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add scallions and 1 1/4 teaspoons salt and cook, stirring, until softened. Stir in hash browns and peas and cook, stirring occasionally, until heated through and potatoes are golden and crisp in patches, about 10 minutes. Stir into shrimp.

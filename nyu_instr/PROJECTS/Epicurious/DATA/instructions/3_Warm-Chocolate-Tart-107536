For crust: Combine flour, sugar, and salt in processor. Blend 5 seconds. Add butter and blend until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add egg and cream and process until moist clumps form. Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk. Wrap dough disk in plastic and chill 1 hour. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Keep chilled. Let dough soften slightly before continuing.)
Preheat oven to 375°F. Roll out dough on floured surface to 14-inch round. Transfer to 9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom. Trim overhang to 1/2 inch; fold in and press, forming double-thick sides. Pierce dough all over with fork. Bake until golden, about 25 minutes. Transfer baked crust to rack. Reduce oven temperature to 350°F.
For filling: Bring whipping cream and milk to boil in heavy medium saucepan. Remove from heat. Add chocolate; whisk until melted and smooth. Whisk eggs, sugar, and salt in large bowl to blend. Gradually whisk chocolate mixture into egg mixture. Pour filling into warm crust.
Bake tart until filling is set in center and puffed at edges, about 25 minutes. Transfer to rack and let cool 15 minutes. Serve warm. (Can be prepared up to 1 day ahead. Cool completely, then cover and refrigerate. Before serving, reheat in 350°F oven 10 minutes or microwave individual slices at 5-second intervals until warm.)

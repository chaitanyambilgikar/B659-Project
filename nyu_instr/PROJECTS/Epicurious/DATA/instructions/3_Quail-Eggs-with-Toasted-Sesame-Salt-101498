Preheat oven to 350°F.
In a baking pan spread seeds evenly and toast, stirring once halfway through toasting, until deep golden, about 12 minutes. Cool seeds and in a food processor pulse with salt until coarsely ground. Sesame salt may be made 2 weeks ahead and kept, covered, at room temperature.
In a saucepan cover eggs with cold water by 1 inch and bring just to a boil. Remove pan from heat and let eggs stand, covered, 7 minutes for quail eggs or 17 minutes for chicken eggs. Drain water from pan and run cold water over eggs, cracking shells against side of pan. Peel eggs and quarter chicken eggs if using.
Serve eggs with salt.

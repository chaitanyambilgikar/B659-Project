Whisk olive oil and lemon juice in small bowl to blend; set dressing aside. Place 1 bresaola slice on work surface with 1 long side parallel to edge. Place 3 arugula leaves at 1 short end so that leaves extend past 1 long side. Top with layer of sliced fennel, then 2 cheese strips. Sprinkle with pepper. Drizzle with 1/2 teaspoon dressing. Starting at filled end, roll up bresaola, enclosing filling. Arrange, seam side down, on platter. Repeat with remaining ingredients to form 18 rolls total. (Can be made 4 hours ahead. Cover with plastic wrap; chill. Before serving, let stand 30 minutes at room temperature.)
*Available at Italian markets and some specialty foods stores.

Brush small rimmed baking sheet with 1 tablespoon oil. Place salmon on prepared baking sheet. Mix orange juice and lemon juice in small bowl; pour over salmon. Drizzle remaining 1 tablespoon oil over salmon; sprinkle with coarse kosher salt and pepper. Let stand 15 minutes.
Preheat broiler. Broil salmon, without turning fish over, until just opaque in center, watching closely and turning baking sheet once for even broiling, about 12 minutes. Using 2 wide spatulas, transfer salmon to platter. Surround with Peas and Pea Tendrils with Lemon Dressing. Serve with Dill-Cucumber Sauce.

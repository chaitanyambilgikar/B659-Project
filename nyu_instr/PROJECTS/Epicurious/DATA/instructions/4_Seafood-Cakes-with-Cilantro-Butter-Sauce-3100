FOR CAKES: Blend scallops, 1/2 cup panko, egg, cream, shallot, garlic, salt and pepper in processor until smooth. Add shrimp and herbs; process using on/off turns until shrimp is finely chopped (do not puree). Transfer to bowl. Cover and chill until cold, about 2 hours (mixture will be soft).
Place 1 1/2 cups panko in bowl. Drop 1/3 cup seafood mixture into panko; turn to coat. Press gently between hands into 3-inch round cake. Transfer cake to baking sheet. Repeat with remaining seafood mixture and panko to form 6 cakes total. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.)
FOR SAUCE: Boil wine, vinegar and shallots in heavy medium saucepan until liquid is reduced to 1/4 cup, about 18 minutes. Add cream and boil until sauce coats spoon, about 3 minutes. (Sauce can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.)
Preheat oven to 350°F. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add 3 seafood cakes and cook until golden, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer to baking sheet. Repeat with 2 tablespoons oil and 3 cakes. Bake until cooked through, about 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, bring sauce to simmer. Remove from heat. Add butter 1 piece at a time; whisk until just melted. Immediately transfer to blender. Add cilantro; blend until cilantro is minced, about 10 seconds. Season with salt and pepper.
Spoon sauce onto 6 plates. Top each with seafood cake and serve.

In a bowl whisk the egg white and the salt until the mixture is frothy and in a shallow dish have the bread crumbs ready. Dip the cutlets in the egg white, letting the excess drip off, coat them with the bread crumbs, patting the crumbs to make them adhere, and transfer the cutlets to a rack set on a baking sheet. Chill the cutlets, uncovered, for 15 minutes.
While the cutlets are chilling, in a small saucepan boil the cranberry juice until it is reduced to about 1/2 cup, add the brown sugar and the vinegar, and boil the mixture until it is syrupy and reduced to about 3 tablespoons. Stir in the zest and keep the glaze warm.
In a large heavy skillet heat 1/4 inch of the oil over moderately high heat until it is hot but not smoking and in it fry the cutlets in 2 batches, turning them once, for 1 1/2 minutes. Transfer the cutlets to paper towels, let them drain, and divide them between plates. Drizzle the cutlets with the glaze.

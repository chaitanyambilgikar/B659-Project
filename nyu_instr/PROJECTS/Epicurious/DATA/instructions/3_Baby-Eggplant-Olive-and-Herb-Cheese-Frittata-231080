Heat oil in medium 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add eggplant halves, cut side down, spacing evenly. Cover; cook until tender, about 10 minutes.
Whisk eggs, olives, basil, and salt in bowl. Sprinkle with pepper. Coarsely crumble half of cheese into eggs; stir to blend. Pour over eggplants, rearranging evenly in pan. Cook uncovered over medium heat until sides set and bottom begins to brown, loosening sides occasionally with spatula, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle with remaining cheese. Cover; cook until set, about 7 minutes.

Make chips: In a kettle heat 3/4-inch oil to 375°F on a deep-fat thermometer and fry tortilla wedges, a dozen at a time, until crisp and most of bubbling subsides, about 1 minute, transferring chips with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain. Sprinkle chips with salt to taste. Tortilla chips may be made 1 day ahead and kept in airtight containers.
Make salsa: In a bowl combine well oil, tomatillos, tomatoes or bell peppers, onion, jalapeños, coriander, and salt to taste and chill salsa, covered, at least 1 hour or overnight.
Serve salsa with chips.

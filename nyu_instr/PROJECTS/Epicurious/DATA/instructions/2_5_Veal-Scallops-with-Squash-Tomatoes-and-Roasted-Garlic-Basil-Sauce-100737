Preheat broiler and lightly spray a baking sheet with vegetable oil.
Cut tomatoes lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick slices and arrange in one layer on baking sheet. Season tomatoes with salt and pepper and broil 3 to 4 inches from heat until edges are browned, about 15 minutes.
While tomatoes are broiling, in a saucepan of boiling salted water cook squash until crisp-tender, about 4 minutes. Drain squash in a colander and season with salt and pepper. Keep tomatoes and squash warm.
In a cup stir together lemon juice, mustard, and oil. If veal scallops are too thick, put each veal scallop between 2 sheets of plastic wrap and with a rolling pin or smooth side of a meat pounder, gently flatten veal to 1/8 inch thick. Pat veal scallops dry and brush one side of each with lemon mixture. Season veal with salt. In a well-seasoned ridged grill pan cook veal scallops in batches over moderately high heat about 1 minute on each side, or until cooked through.
If scallops are large, cut in half diagonally. Serve veal with tomatoes, squash, and sauce.

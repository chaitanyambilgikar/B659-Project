1. Remove the root and tough outer leaves from the leek; halve lengthwise. Soak in vinegar and water to cover for 30 minutes. Rinse. Cut into 1/4-inch dice.
2. Heat the oil and butter in a pot. Add the leek, onion and parsnip; cook over low heat to soften, 15 minutes.
3. Add the broth and tarragon; bring to a boil. Add the asparagus; cover, then simmer for 30 minutes or until very tender. Uncover and cool.
4. Puree the soup. (If it seems stringy, pour through a strainer.) Add the cream. The soup may be served chilled or reheated over low heat; do not boil. Serve 1 1/2 cups of soup per bowl, placing 3 melon balls in the center of each serving, surrounded by 4 mint leaves. Add a dollop of sour cream on one side of each bowl.

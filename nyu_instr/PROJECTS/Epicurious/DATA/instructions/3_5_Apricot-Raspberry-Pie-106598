Place a baking sheet in middle of oven and preheat oven to 450°F.
Whisk together cornstarch, salt, and 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar in a large bowl.
Roll out 1 piece of dough (keep remaining piece chilled) on a lightly floured surface with a lightly floured rolling pin into a 13-inch round and fit into a 9-inch glass pie plate (4-cup capacity). Trim edge, leaving a 1/2-inch overhang. Chill shell while rolling out dough for top crust.
Roll out remaining piece of dough into an 11-inch round.
Stir apricots into sugar mixture until combined, then gently stir in raspberries and spoon filling into shell.
Cover pie with pastry round and trim with kitchen shears, leaving a 1/2-inch overhang. Crimp edge decoratively. Brush top of pie with egg and sprinkle all over with remaining 2 tablespoons sugar. Cut 3 steam vents in top crust with a sharp small knife.
Bake pie on hot baking sheet 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 375°F and continue to bake until crust is golden brown and filling is bubbling, about 45 minutes more. Cool pie on a rack at least 2 hours before serving.

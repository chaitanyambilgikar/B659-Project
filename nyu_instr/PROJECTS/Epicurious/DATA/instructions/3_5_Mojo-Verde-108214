Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Lightly rub the poblanos and tomatillos with canola oil. Place on a baking sheet , and roast for 20 minutes. Put the poblanos in a bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and let stand for about 15 minutes. Set the tomatillos aside to cool.
Peel the poblanos and remove the stems and seeds.
Combine all of the ingredients in a food processor and puree until fairly smooth. Refrigerated, this will keep for up to 1 month.

Prepare Turkey: Preheat oven to 500°F.
Melt the butter.
Use a hypodermic needle or baster-injector to inject the butter into the turkey. Or stuff solid butter under turkey skin.
Place thyme in turkey cavity, lightly salt and pepper the bird inside and out.
When temperature reaches 500°F, put turkey in the oven. Let cook for 20 minutes or until the exterior is crisp, but not golden brown. Reduce heat to 375°F. Let bird roast until finished. You should have a crispy, golden brown turkey with very, very tender, buttery meat.
Prepare Dressing: Render bacon. Reserve fat.
Add garlic and onion to bacon fat and saute. Add salt and pepper to taste.
Sauté onions until translucent.
Add stock. Reduce slightly. Add bread cubes. Salt and pepper to taste.
Add grated carrot. Gently mix.
Crush bacon and add to mixture.
Add walnuts to mixture. Let mixture cool.
Mix in the eggs until they are well incorporated.
Place in heatproof pan (or turkey cavity) and cook at 375°F until crisp on top.
Garnish with dried raisins or cranberries.

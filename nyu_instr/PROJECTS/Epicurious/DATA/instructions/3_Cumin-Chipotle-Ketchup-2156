Stir cumin seeds in heavy small saucepan over medium heat until fragrant and seeds darken, about 1 minute. Transfer to plate and cool. Grind seeds in spice grinder or in mortar with pestle.
Return cumin to same saucepan. Whisk in ketchup, chipotle chilies with 1 tablespoon spicy tomato sauce, lime juice and tequila. Simmer over medium-low heat until ketchup thickens slightly, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature. (Can be made 1 week ahead. Cover and chill.)

Preheat oven to 350°F. Grease a 10- by 2-inch round cake pan and line bottom with a round of wax paper or parchment. Grease paper and dust pan with flour, knocking out excess.
Sift together flour, baking powder, and salt.
Beat butter with an electric mixer until creamy. Gradually beat in sugar on medium speed until pale and fluffy. Add vanilla, then beat in eggs, 1 at a time. (Mixture may look curdled.)
Alternately beat in flour mixture and milk in 3 batches on low speed. Increase speed to medium and beat batter 1 1/2 minutes, or until smooth. Fold in coconut.
Spoon batter into cake pan and spread evenly.
Bake cake in middle of oven until golden brown and a tester comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes. Cool cake in pan on a rack 1 hour, then invert onto rack. Remove paper and reinvert onto another rack to cool completely.

In a 5-quart kettle bring 4 quarts salted water to a boil for pasta.
In a 12-inch heavy skillet cook garlic with pepper flakes in oil over moderate heat, stirring, until garlic begins to turn golden. Add bell peppers with salt to taste and cook, stirring, until softened. Add wine and boil, stirring occasionally until almost all liquid is evaporated. Add broth or water and simmer, covered, until bell peppers are tender, about 5 minutes. Pepper mixture may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered. Reheat mixture in skillet before proceeding.
In boiling water cook pasta until al dente and drain in a colander. Add pasta to pepper mixture with parsley and toss with salt and pepper to taste over moderate heat until combined well and heated through.
Divide pasta mixture among 6 small plates and garnish with parsley.

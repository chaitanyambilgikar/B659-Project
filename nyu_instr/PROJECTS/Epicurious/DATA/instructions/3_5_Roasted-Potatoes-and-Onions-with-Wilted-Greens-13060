Preheat oven to 450°F.
Cut potatoes in half (quarter any larger potatoes). In a shallow baking pan toss potatoes and onion slices with oil and season with salt and pepper. Roast potatoes and onions in middle of oven, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned and tender, about 25 minutes.
Transfer hot potatoes and onions to a bowl. Add spinach or arugula, vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste, tossing until greens are wilted.
Serve dish warm or at room temperature.

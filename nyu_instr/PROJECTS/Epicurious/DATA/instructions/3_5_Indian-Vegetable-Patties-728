Mix first 12 ingredients in large bowl to blend. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Stir in egg. Form 3 tablespoons of mixture into 3-inch-diameter patty. Place on large baking sheet. Repeat with remaining mixture. Refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour.
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in heavy large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Cook vegetable patties in batches until golden, adding more oil as necessary, about 4 minutes per side. Serve with yogurt and chutney.

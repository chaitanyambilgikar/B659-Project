Cook first 3 ingredients covered in heavy medium saucepan over medium-low heat until apples are falling-apart tender, stirring occasionally, about 40 minutes. Mix in gelatin and stir until dissolved. Adjust tartness with lemon juice, if desired. Cover and let cool. Refrigerate until cold and thickened, at least 2 hours. (Can be prepared up to 3 days ahead.)

Heat oil in large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add onion and sauté until tender, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and sauté 1 minute. Add tomatoes, herbs and sugar. Reduce heat and simmer until mixture thickens, stirring frequently, about 20 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. (Sauce can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Bring to simmer before using.)
Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally. Add arugula and cook until wilted, about 1 minute. Drain. Return pasta and arugula to pot. Add sauce and toss to coat. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Divide pasta among plates. Sprinkle with cheese and serve.

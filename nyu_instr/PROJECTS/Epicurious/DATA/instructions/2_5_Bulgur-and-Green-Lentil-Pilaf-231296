Bring first 3 ingredients to boil in large saucepan over medium-high heat. Partially cover pan, reduce heat to low, and simmer until lentils are almost tender, about 15 minutes. Mix in bulgur, salt, and spices. Cover; simmer until water is absorbed, about 10 minutes longer. Season with pepper. Discard bay leaves. Serve topped with almonds and reserved onions.

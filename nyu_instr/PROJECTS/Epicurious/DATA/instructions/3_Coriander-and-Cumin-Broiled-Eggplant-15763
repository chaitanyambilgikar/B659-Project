Preheat broiler and lightly oil a baking pan.
Cut eggplant into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Chop cilantro and in a bowl stir together with remaining ingredients and salt and pepper to taste. Brush cilantro mixture on both sides of eggplant slices and transfer to baking pan. Broil eggplant 5 to 6 inches from heat until golden and cooked through, about 10 minutes.

With machine running, drop garlic cloves through feed tube of processor and chop finely. Add sea bass and next 8 ingredients and process just until blended. Transfer to large bowl; stir in crabmeat, shrimp, cilantro and red bell pepper.
Pour enough oil into heavy large skillet to reach depth of 1 inch; heat oil over medium-high heat to 350°F. Working in batches, drop rounded tablespoonfuls of fritter mixture into hot oil. Fry fritters until golden brown and cooked through, turning occasionally, about 5 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer cooked fritters to paper-towel-lined plate; drain.
Arrange fritters on platter with lettuce leaves. Serve with Chili-Lime Sauce.

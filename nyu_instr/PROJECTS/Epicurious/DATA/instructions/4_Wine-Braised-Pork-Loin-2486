Combine first 5 ingredients in small bowl. Pat pork dry; rub with salt mixture. Cover and chill 6 to 24 hours.
Preheat oven to 350°F. Wipe pork dry. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy Dutch oven or casserole over high heat. Add pork; brown on all sides, about 10 minutes. Transfer to plate. Reduce heat to medium and add remaining 1 tablespoon oil to Dutch oven. Add onions and sauté until very tender, about 10 minutes. Add garlic and peppers and sauté until peppers begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Add wine, tomatoes, broth, bay leaves and marjoram. Add pork, fat side up, and drippings on plate. Bring to boil. Cover; bake until tender, 45 minutes.
Transfer pork to platter and let stand 15 minutes. If necessary, boil sauce until reduced to 4 cups. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Place half of sauce in baking dish. Top with pork slices, then remaining sauce. Cover and chill. Rewarm in covered dish in 350°F. oven until heated through, about 30 minutes.) Serve pork with sauce.

In a heavy skillet large enough to hold the lamb chops without touching heat the oil over moderately high heat until it is a hot but not smoking and in it sauté the potato, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch dice, turning the pieces constantly with a metal spatula, for 6 to 8 minutes, or until they are golden. Transfer the potato pieces with a slotted spoon to paper towels and let them drain. In the oil remaining in the skillet sauté the chops, patted dry and seasoned with salt and pepper, over moderately high heat for 5 minutes on each side for medium-rare meat and transfer them to a heated platter. Remove the skillet from the heat, pour off the fat, and add the zucchini. Cook the zucchini over moderate heat, stirring, for 1 minute, stir in the lemon juice and the water, and cook the mixture, for 1 minute. Stir in the potato pieces, the mint, and salt and pepper to taste and spoon the mixture around the lamb chops.

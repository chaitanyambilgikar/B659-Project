Simmer milk, coconut, brown sugar, almonds, raisins, and cardamom in a small skillet over medium heat, stirring, until liquid has evaporated. Cool.
Put a rounded teaspoon filling in center of a wrapper. Lightly brush edge of wrapper with water, then fold in half (diagonally if square) and press to seal. Form remaining dumplings.
Heat 1 inch oil to 350°F in a 12-inch skillet. Fry dumplings in 3 or 4 batches, turning once or twice, until golden- brown, 2 to 3 minutes per batch.

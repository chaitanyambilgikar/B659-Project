For Ice Cream: Cook 1 cup sugar and 1/3 cup water in heavy medium saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring until sugar dissolves. Increase heat and boil without stirring until syrup turns deep amber color, occasionally swirling pan and brushing sides of pan with pastry brush dipped into water, about 10 minutes. Add whipping cream (mixture will bubble vigorously) and whisk until smooth. Whisk in half and half and bring to simmer. Whisk egg yolks in medium bowl to blend. Gradually whisk in hot cream mixture. Return mixture to saucepan and stir over low heat until custard thickens and leaves path on back of spoon when finger is drawn across, about 4 minutes; do not boil. Strain custard into bowl. Whisk in crème fraîche and vanilla extract. Refrigerate custard until well chilled.
Transfer custard to ice cream maker and process according to manufacturer's instructions. (Can be prepared 1 week ahead. Freeze in covered container.)
For sauce: Cook both sugars, apple juice and butter in heavy medium heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat and boil until reduced to 1 cup, stirring frequently, about 3 minutes. Cool sauce to lukewarm, about 20 minutes. (Can be prepared 3 days ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Before using, rewarm sauce over low heat just until liquid.)
Spoon ice cream into parfait glasses, wineglasses or bowls. Drizzle sauce over. Sprinkle with raspberries if desired.

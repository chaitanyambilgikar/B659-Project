Melt the butter on a skillet, add the chopped onions, cover tightly and steam over a very low flame until thoroughly puréed and soft. Add chicken broth, wine and simmer for 15-20 minutes. Season to taste.
Sprinkle the fried crouton with the grated cheeses and put under the broiler flame briefly to melt the cheese. Serve the soup in a large heated tureen. Put croutons in each soup plate or bowl and ladle soup over them. Pass bowls of raw onion and parsley for garnish.

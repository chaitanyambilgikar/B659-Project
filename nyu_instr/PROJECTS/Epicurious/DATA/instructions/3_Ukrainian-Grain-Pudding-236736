In medium saucepan over high heat, combine barley and 5 cups water. Cover and bring to boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer until tender, about 30 minutes, adding more water if necessary to keep barley covered.
Meanwhile, bring small saucepan water to boil. Stir in poppy seeds, then remove from heat and let stand, covered, 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, in small, dry skillet over moderate heat, toast almonds, shaking pan constantly, until browned and fragrant, about 4 minutes. Set aside.
In fine-mesh sieve, drain poppy seeds, then transfer to food processor. Process until finely ground. When barley is tender, drain, reserving 1/2 cup of liquid. (If there isn't enough, add water to make 1/2 cup.) Transfer barley to large bowl. Stir in reserved liquid, honey, and salt. Stir in toasted almonds, ground poppy seeds, apricots, and raisins.
Preheat the oven to 325°F. Lightly butter 8-inch square baking dish or 2-quart shallow casserole dish. Press barley mixture evenly into pan. Bake 20 minutes, then cool in pan, cover, and chill overnight.
In small bowl, whisk together sugar and cinnamon. Spoon chilled kutia into small bowls, sprinkle with cinnamon-sugar if desired, and serve.

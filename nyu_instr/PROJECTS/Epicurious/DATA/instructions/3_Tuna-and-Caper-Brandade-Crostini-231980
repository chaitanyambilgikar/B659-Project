Make brandade: Combine potatoes, milk, garlic, bay leaf, thyme, salt, and pepper in a 1- to 1 1/2-quart heavy saucepan and bring to a simmer, stirring. Reduce heat to low and gently simmer, partially covered, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are very tender, about 10 minutes. Discard bay leaf and transfer to a large bowl.
Add tuna and capers to hot potato mixture, then beat with an electric mixer at low speed, adding oil in a slow stream, until potatoes and tuna are broken up but not smooth and oil is incorporated. Season with salt and pepper.

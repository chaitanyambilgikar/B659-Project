In the bowl of an electric mixer cream the butter with the brown sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy, into the bowl sift together the cinnamon, the ginger, the cardamom, the cloves, the salt, and the flour, and beat the mixture until it is just combined. In a small bowl stir together the baking soda and the water, beat the mixture into the dough, and chill the dough, wrapped in plastic wrap, for at least 30 minutes or overnight.
Preheat the oven to 375°F. Halve the dough, roll out one of the halves 1/8 inch thick between sheets of plastic wrap, and cut out cookies with 2-inch decorative cutters (such as stars or gingerbread men). Roll out the remaining dough and cut out more cookies in the same manner. Bake the cookies in batches on buttered baking sheets in the middle of the oven for 8 minutes, transfer them to racks, and let them cool completely. The cookies may be made 1 month in advance and kept frozen in airtight containers.
In a small bowl whisk together the confectioners' sugar and the lemon juice and transfer the icing to a resealable plastic bag. Cut a small opening in a bottom corner of the bag, pipe the icing onto the cookies, and let it dry completely.

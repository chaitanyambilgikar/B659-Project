Heat 1 tablespoon oil in large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add onion and sauté until tender and just beginning to color, about 5 minutes. Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil and cabbage and cook until cabbage is tender, stirring occasionally and adding water by tablespoonfuls if cabbage sticks, about 10 minutes. Mix in prosciutto. Season with salt and pepper.

Cut the top quarter off the loaf horizontally with a serrated knife and remove the soft crumb from the top and bottom sections, leaving two 1/2-inch-thick shells. In a bowl stir together the olives, the Jarlsberg, the artichoke hearts, the red peppers, the parsley, the capers, the oil, and salt and pepper to taste and spoon the mixture into the bottom bread shell, smoothing the surface. Fit the top bread shell on the filled bottom shell and press the sandwich together firmly, re-forming the loaf. Wrap the sandwich tightly in plastic wrap, chill it for 1 hour, and with the serrated knife cut it carefully into 4 wedges. (The sandwich may be made 1 day in advance and kept wrapped and chilled).

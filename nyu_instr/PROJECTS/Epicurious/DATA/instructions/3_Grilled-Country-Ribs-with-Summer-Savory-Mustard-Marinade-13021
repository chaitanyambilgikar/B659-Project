Prepare grill.
In a bowl whisk together mustard, vinegar, oil, summer savory, water, and salt and pepper to taste. In a baking dish large enough to hold ribs in one layer coat them with marinade and let stand, covered, at room temperature 15 minutes.
Grill ribs on an oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals until just cooked through, about 10 minutes on each side.

Heat oil in heavy large nonstick skillet over low heat. Add leeks and garlic. Cover and cook until leeks are very tender and beginning to turn golden, approximately 25 minutes.
Increase heat to medium-high. Mix in chicken broth, tomatoes, clam juice, wine and cayenne. Boil 2 minutes. Place clams atop leek mixture in center of skillet. Top clams with shrimp, then scallops. Season with pepper. Cover and boil until clams are just opened, about 4 minutes. Ladle stew into bowls. Sprinkle with chives and serve.

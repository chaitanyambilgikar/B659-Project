For crust: Preheat oven to 400°F. Transfer crust to 9-inch-diameter pie dish. Trim edges of crust and pierce all over with fork. Bake pie crust until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Cool crust completely on rack.
For filling: Place yolks in medium bowl. Combine sugar and cornstarch in heavy medium saucepan. Whisk in half and half. Bring mixture to boil over medium-high heat, whisking constantly. Boil 1 minute. Whisk half of mixture into yolks. Return yolk mixture to saucepan. Boil 1 minute, whisking constantly. Remove from heat. Stir in butter and vanilla. Place chocolate chips in medium bowl. Add 1 cup hot custard and stir until chocolate chips melt and mixture is smooth. Add peanut butter chips to remaining custard in saucepan and stir until peanut butter chips melt and mixture is smooth.
Spread chocolate mixture evenly into prepared crust. Gently spoon peanut butter mixture over chocolate, spreading to edge of crust. Place plastic wrap atop pie to prevent skin from forming. Cool pie on rack 1 hour. Refrigerate until set, about 2 hours. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.)
For topping: Using electric mixer, beat whipping cream in medium bowl to soft peaks. Add sugar and beat until stiff peaks form. Spoon topping into pastry bag fitted with large star tip. Pipe cream decoratively atop pie. Sprinkle with grated semisweet chocolate.

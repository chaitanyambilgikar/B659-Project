Peel sweet potatoes and quarter length-wise. In a food processor shred sweet potatoes.
In a 12-inch non-stick skillet heat oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and sauté sweet potatoes with cumin and salt and pepper to taste, stirring, until just tender, about 3 minutes. Stir in scallion and lemon juice.

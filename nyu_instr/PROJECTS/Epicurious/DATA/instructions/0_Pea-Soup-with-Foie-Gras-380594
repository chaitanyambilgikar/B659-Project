Place peas in a large pot; add cold water to cover by 2". Let soak overnight.
Drain peas; return to pot. Add onion, carrot, celery, and bacon. Add water to cover ingredients by 2". Bring to a boil over medium-low heat, stirring often. Continue cooking at a very low simmer, stirring every 15 minutes and occasionally skimming foam from the surface, until peas are almost tender, 2–3 hours (time will vary depending on age of peas). Season with salt. Simmer until peas are very tender, 15-45 minutes longer. Season to taste with salt and pepper. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 days ahead. Let cool slightly. Chill uncovered until cold, then cover and chill. Return to a simmer before continuing.
Season foie gras cubes, if using, with salt; divide among warmed bowls. Ladle hot soup over cubes and let stand until foie gras is warmed through, about 2 minutes. Drizzle with oil; sprinkle with pepper.

Heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Sprinkle enough Parmesan cheese to just cover the bottom of the pan (for a 9-inch pan, use about 3-4 tablespoons cheese). When it is golden brown — which can take less than 1 minute — use a pair of tongs to grab the edge and gently lift it out of the pan. Turn and cook the other side briefly.
Blot excess oil on a paper towel.
Working quickly, shape the frico on a rolling pin to form a cylinder, oraround the base of a cup to form a basket.
Serve alone as an assaggino — the little morsel you offer guests when theyarrive.

1. Preheat oven to 425°F.
2. On 2 baking sheets, arrange onion slices in a single layer; brush both sides with olive oil.
3. Place the tomatoes in 1 or 2 shallow pans, cut-sides up, and brush the cut sides with olive oil.
4. Bake onions for 25 minutes (cook in 2 batches), turning after 15 minutes, until golden brown. Set aside. Roast tomatoes for 25 minutes, until centers are soft.
5. To serve, spoon ricotta in the center of a large plate. Separate the onion slices into rings and place in 4 even piles around the cheese. Arrange the tomatoes between the onions. Season with salt and pepper. Drizzle with any remaining olive oil. Sprinkle with basil and serve with toasted peasant bread.

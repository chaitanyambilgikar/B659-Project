Preheat oven to 350°F. Toss fresh figs with 2 tablespoons oil in bowl. Arrange figs on rimmed baking sheet. Roast until figs are tender and shiny, about 12 minutes. (Do not roast dried figs.) Cool. Cut figs lengthwise in half.
Whisk remaining 1/2 cup oil and vinegar in small bowl to blend. Add cheese and whisk to blend. Season to taste with salt and pepper. (Figs and dressing can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover separately and refrigerate. Bring to room temperature and rewhisk dressing before using.)
Combine frisée, baby greens, watercress, prosciutto and walnuts in large bowl. Add dressing; toss to coat. Gently mix in figs. Transfer to serving bowl.

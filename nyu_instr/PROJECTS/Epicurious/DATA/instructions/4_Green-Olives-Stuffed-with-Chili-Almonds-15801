Preheat oven to 375°F.
In a large sieve rinse olives and drain well. In a bowl stir together 1/2 teaspoon oil and 1/2 teaspoon chili powder and add almonds, tossing to coat. Transfer almonds to a baking sheet and toast in middle of oven until fragrant and a couple of shades darker, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool almonds just until they can be handled and stuff each olive with an almond. In bowl toss olives with remaining oil and chili powder. Olives may be made 1 day ahead and kept, covered, at cool room temperature (almonds will begin to soften after about 4 hours).

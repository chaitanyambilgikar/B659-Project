In a mixing bowl blend the milk with the baking soda. In a separate bowl beat the eggs. Add the salt and sugar. Blend in the milk mixture, flour, and cornmeal. Stir in the melted shortening. Mix lightly but thoroughly.
Pour the batter into a hot, greased shallow baking pan. Bake at 375° for about 25 to 35 minutes or until golden.

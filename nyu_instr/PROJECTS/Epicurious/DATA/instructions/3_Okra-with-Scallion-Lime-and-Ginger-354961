Steam okra in a steamer over boiling water, covered, until just tender, about 7 minutes. Transfer to a serving dish.
Cook scallions in oil with 1/2 teaspoon salt in a small skillet over medium heat, stirring, just until softened, 1 to 3 minutes. Pour over okra and toss with ginger. Serve with lime wedges for squeezing over okra.

Place chicken in a large saucepan. Add 6 cups water, 1 teaspoon salt, 2 garlic cloves and peppercorns. Boil. Reduce heat to low; cover. Simmer 15 to 20 minutes. Remove chicken. Pull meat from bones; shred; set aside. Place tomatillos and chiles in a saucepan; cover with water; boil over medium-high heat 8 minutes. Drain, reserving 1/2 cup liquid. Transfer to a blender; add remaining 2 cloves garlic and cilantro; blend until smooth, adding liquid if necessary. Heat oil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Add tomatillo-chile puree; reduce heat to medium. Simmer, stirring constantly, 10 minutes or until sauce reduces to about 1 cup. Reduce heat, add remaining 1 teaspoon salt and sour cream. Stir about 1 minute. Set aside.
Heat oven to 350°F. Heat a skillet over medium heat; warm tortillas 10 seconds per side. Divide shredded chicken evenly among tortillas; roll up. Spread 1/3 sauce in a 9" baking dish.

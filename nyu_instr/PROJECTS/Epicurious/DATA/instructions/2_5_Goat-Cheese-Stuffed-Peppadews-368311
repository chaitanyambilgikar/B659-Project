Drain Peppadews upside down on a rack. If necessary, and taking care not to slice peppers open, pare bottoms so they sit flat. In a food processor, blend cheeses, scallions and 2 tablespoons parsley. In a bowl, season cheese mixture with salt and black pepper. Fill a pastry bag (or resealable bag with a corner snipped) with cheese mixture; chill 1 hour. Pipe cheese evenly into each pepper. Sprinkle tops with remaining 2 tablespoons parsley. DO AHEAD: You can prep the cheese filling 24 hours in advance and store it in the bag in the fridge; remove it 1/2 hour before needed. Stuffed peppers can be refrigerated for up to 2 hours.

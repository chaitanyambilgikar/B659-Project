Make cake: Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter 13 x 9 x 2-inch baking pan. Using electric mixer, beat sugar and vegetable shortening in large bowl to blend. Beat in eggs and egg whites, then milk and vanilla extract. Add flour and beat just until blended. Transfer batter to prepared pan. Bake cake until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool cake in pan.
Make frosting: Combine first 6 ingredients in heavy large saucepan. Whisk constantly over medium-low heat until butter melts and mixture thickens (do not boil), about 10 minutes. Stir in pecans and coconut. Cool until frosting is thick enough to spread but is still warm, about 40 minutes.
Spread warm frosting over cake in pan. Let cool completely. Sprinkle chocolate chips over cake, pressing gently to adhere. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Bring to room temperature before serving.)

Punch dough down. Turn out onto floured surface; knead briefly until smooth. Return to oiled bowl; turn to coat. Cover with plastic, then kitchen towel. Let dough rise 40 minutes. Punch dough down. Turn out onto floured surface. Divide into 4 pieces. Cover with plastic; chill at least 1 hour or overnight.

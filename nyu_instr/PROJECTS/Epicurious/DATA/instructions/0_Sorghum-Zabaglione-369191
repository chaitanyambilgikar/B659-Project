Put the heavy cream in a mixing bowl and whip it by hand with a balloon whisk until you have softly whipped cream. Most people overwhip cream, so make sure you have very silky smooth soft peaks and not firm cream with an almost broken texture. Place the whipped cream in the fridge.
In a large stainless-steel or heat-proof glass bowl, whisk the egg yolks with the sorghum, lemon zest, lemon juice, vanilla seeds, and Riesling until well mixed, about 2 minutes.
Create a double boiler by placing a large pot on the stove over medium-high heat with 2 inches of water in it. Insert the bowl of egg yolks into the pot and whisk vigorously. The heat is there but the water is insulating the eggs from scrambling. Whisk for about 5 minutes, making sure not to get the eggs too hot. If you feel like they are in jeopardy of scrambling, remove the bowl from the heat and then return it to the pot when it has stabilized. You should have very nice ribbon custard at this point, almost double in volume what you started with.
Remove the bowl from the heat and continue whisking until the zabaglione base is thick and has cooled to room temperature.
Fold the zabaglione base into the whipped cream and set aside. The zabaglione can sit in the fridge up to 24 hours before it deflates.

Heat olive oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add chopped shallots and sauté 1 minute. Add portobello and shiitake mushrooms and bell pepper and sauté until vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes. Add white wine and boil until liquid is reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Add 1 cup whipping cream and simmer until sauce thickens, about 5 minutes. Add remaining 1 cup whipping cream and diced smoked turkey; simmer 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite. Drain well. Add pasta to sauce in pot and toss to coat. Add cheese and chives and toss to combine. Season with salt and pepper and serve.

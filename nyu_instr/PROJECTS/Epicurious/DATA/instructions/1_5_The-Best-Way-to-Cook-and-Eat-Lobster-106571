1. Choose live lobsters about 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 pounds each, figuring on half a lobster per person. Bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil. Drop the lobsters in the water head-first, cover, and return the pot to a boil. Cook lobsters until they are bright red and cooked through, about 8 minutes.
2. Remove the lobsters from the water with tongs and let rest for 4 to 5 minutes to settle. Lay each cooked lobster on its back on a cutting board. Cut in half, down the center from the head to the tail. Carefully pull the shell apart with your hands. Remove the gills and the stomach sac behind the head and discard. Remove the intestinal vein. Leave the roe in place.
3. Before eating, tie on a bib. Start by separating the lobster's head from the tail by twisting it off. Next, remove the tail meat from its shell with a small, dull knife (or your fingers!). Crack the claws and remove the meat with a pick. Now suck the meat from the legs. Eat up and have fun!

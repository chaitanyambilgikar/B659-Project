Preheat oven to 300°F. and lightly oil a 12-inch square of foil.
In a large baking pan toast almonds in one layer in middle of oven 15 to 20 minutes, or until fragrant and golden.
In a heavy saucepan bring sugar, water, and cream of tartar to a boil over moderate heat and stir until sugar is dissolved. Boil syrup, without stirring, washing down sugar crystals on side of pan with a brush dipped in cold water, until syrup turns pale golden. Continue to cook syrup, without stirring, swirling pan occasionally, until it is a deep golden caramel. Add almonds, stirring until coated well. Immediately pour mixture onto foil, spreading as much as possible to form one layer, and cool completely, about 30 minutes. Remove praline from foil and break into 1 1/2-inch pieces. Praline may be made 1 week ahead and kept in an airtight container.
Reserve 1/2 cup praline for garnish if desired and in food processor chop fine remaining praline. Add salt and continue to let motor run until nuts release their oil and mixture turns into a smooth paste, about 15 minutes. Let praline butter cool. Praline butter may be made several days ahead and kept chilled, covered. Let praline butter soften to room temperature before using.

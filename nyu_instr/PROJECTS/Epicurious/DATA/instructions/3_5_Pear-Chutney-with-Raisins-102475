Heat oil in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat. Add chopped onions and sauté until tender, about 5 minutes. Add remaining ingredients and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until pears are tender and mixture thickens slightly, about 30 minutes. Discard cloves. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Cool. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.) Serve cold or at room temperature.

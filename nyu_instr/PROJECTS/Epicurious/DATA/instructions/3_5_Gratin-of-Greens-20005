Wash and dry the spinach, chop rather fine and cook in a little olive oil in a heavy skillet over medium heat until just wilted. Drain. Chop the chard and cook in the same manner. Dice the zucchini, and cook in 6 tablespoons oil until just tender. Combine the vegetables with salt, the rice and garlic. Transfer to a well-oiled heavy baking dish. Add 3-4 tablespoons olive oil, and heat in a 300°F. oven for 20 minutes. Add the eggs, well beaten, sprinkle with crumbs and return to the oven until the eggs just set. Eat warm or cold.

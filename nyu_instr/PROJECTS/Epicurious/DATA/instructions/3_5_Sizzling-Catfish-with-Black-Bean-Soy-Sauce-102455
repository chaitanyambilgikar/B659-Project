Preheat oven to 350°F. Using knife, make 6 diagonal slits on 1 side of each fish, spacing evenly and cutting to the bone. Insert 1 ginger slice into each slit. Turn fish over. Make 6 diagonal slits on second side of each fish; insert remaining sliced ginger. Sprinkle catfish with enough rice flour to coat on all sides.
Heat 1 1/2 cups peanut oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat until thermometer registers 375°F. Gently slide 1 catfish into skillet and fry until golden and almost cooked through, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer to rimmed baking sheet. Repeat frying with second catfish.
Bake catfish in oven until cooked through and opaque in center, about 10 minutes. Transfer to platter. Pour Black Bean-Soy Sauce over. Garnish platter with tomato, green onions and lime wedges. Serve immediately.

Thinly slice 2 garlic cloves. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in heavy small skillet over low heat. Add sliced garlic and sauté until tender, about 10 minutes. Set aside.
Cook potatoes and remaining 8 garlic cloves in large saucepan of boiling salted water until potatoes are tender, about 35 minutes. Drain, reserving 1 1/4 cups cooking liquid. Combine boiled potatoes and garlic, sautéed garlic mixture and remaining 3 tablespoons oil in same saucepan. Mash until smooth, adding enough reserved cooking liquid to form creamy consistency. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer potatoes to bowl. (Can be prepared 8 hours ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Rewarm potatoes in microwave until heated through.) Sprinkle with parsley and serve.

In a sieve lined with a single thickness of dampened paper towels set over a bowl let the yogurt drain for 2 hours. In a dry small heavy skillet toast the cumin seeds over moderate heat shaking the skillet, for 2 to 3 minutes, or until they turn several shades darker and begin to pop, and in a spice or coffee grinder pulverize them.
In a blender of in a food processor fitted with the steel blade blend the drained yogurt, the sour cream, the mint leaves, 1/2 teaspoon of the pulverized cumin seeds, and the salt until the mixture is a pale green. Transfer the sauce to a serving bowl and chill it, covered, for at least 2 hours or overnight. Sprinkle the remaining pulverized cumin seeds decoratively over the sauce.

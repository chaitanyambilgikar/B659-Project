Cut off and discard peel, including white pith, from orange with a sharp knife, then cut orange into 1-inch pieces. Stir together with remaining ingredients and 1 teaspoon salt.
Working in batches, purée in a blender until smooth, about 30 seconds per batch, then force each batch through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl. Whisk, then season with salt and chill, covered, 1 hour. Whisk before serving.

Preheat oven to 300°F. Heat 1 tablespoons olive oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add chili powder, cumin, sugar, curry powder, garlic powder and cayenne pepper and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add peanuts and stir until coated, about 2 minutes. Transfer to large rimmed baking sheet.
Bake peanuts until golden brown and almost dry, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes. Season with salt. Transfer to paper towels; drain. Cool. (Peanuts can be made 3 days ahead. Store in airtight container at room temperature.)

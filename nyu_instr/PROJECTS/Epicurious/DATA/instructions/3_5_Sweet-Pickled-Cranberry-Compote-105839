Toast coriander in heavy small skillet over medium heat until fragrant, stirring often, about 1 1/2 minutes. Cool. Coarsely crush coriander in mortar with pestle.
Transfer coriander to medium saucepan. Add all remaining ingredients except cranberries and bring to boil, stirring until sugar dissolves. Reduce heat to low and simmer until mixture is reduced to 2 cups, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes. Add cranberries and simmer until half of berries burst, about 5 minutes. Transfer mixture to bowl and cool. Remove orange peel. Cover compote and refrigerate overnight to allow flavors to develop. (Can be made 1 week ahead. Keep refrigerated.) Using slotted spoon, transfer cranberries to another bowl; add some of syrup and serve.

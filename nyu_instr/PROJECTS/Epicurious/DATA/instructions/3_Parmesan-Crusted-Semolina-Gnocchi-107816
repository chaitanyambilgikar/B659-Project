Whisk together semolina, milk, and salt in a 2-quart heavy saucepan and bring to a boil over moderate heat, whisking frequently. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring frequently, until very stiff, 8 to 10 minutes. Spread mixture in a lightly oiled 8-inch square nonstick baking pan and chill, uncovered, until very firm, about 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 450°F.
Unmold semolina mixture by inverting pan over a cutting board and rapping pan sharply on board to release mixture. Cut mixture into 16 squares.
Lightly brush 4 (4-ounce) gratin dishes or 1 (13- by 9-inch) baking dish with melted butter and overlap gnocchi in dishes or dish. Brush gnocchi with remaining butter and sprinkle with cheese. If using gratin dishes, transfer to a shallow baking pan. Bake in middle of oven until cheese is golden around edges, about 15 minutes. Cool in dishes or dish on a rack 5 minutes before serving.

Steam potatoes until tender, about 9 minutes. (Can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.)
Heat oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Add garlic and stir 30 seconds. Add potatoes and herbs; sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper. Sauté until potatoes are heated through and golden, about 8 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to bowl and serve.

1. Heat the oil in a medium saucepan until it reaches 360°F on a deep-fat thermometer.
2. Put the flour on a large plate and season with salt and pepper. Working in batches, dredge the shallots in the flour. Transfer them to a large slotted spoon or spider and tap off the excess flour. Fry the shallots in batches, stirring a few times, until light golden brown and crisp, 30 to 45 seconds. Transfer with a slotted spoon to a plate lined with paper towels and season with salt and pepper.

Preheat oven to 350°F. Cut oranges into 1/16- to 1/8-inch-thick rounds. Arrange orange slices (in layers, if necessary) in 11 x 7 x 2-inch glass baking dish. Sprinkle with salt and rosemary; dot with butter. Pour in enough broth to cover oranges. Cover dish with foil.
Place dish in oven; braise oranges until tender and rind looks translucent, about 1 hour. Cool. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Rewarm and remove from sauce before using.

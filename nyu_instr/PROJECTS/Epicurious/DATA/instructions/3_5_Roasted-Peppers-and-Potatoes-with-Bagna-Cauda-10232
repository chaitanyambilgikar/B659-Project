Preheat broiler.
In a large shallow roasting pan, broil peppers about 2 inches from heat, turning every 5 minutes, until skins are blistered and charred, 15 to 25 minutes. Transfer peppers to a bowl and let steam, covered, until cool. Starting at blossom end, peel peppers and discard stems, seeds and ribs. Cut peppers into thirds. Peppers may be made 3 days ahead and chilled, covered. Drain peppers before using.
Preheat oven to 450°F.
Peel potatoes and cut crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices. In a shallow baking pan, toss potatoes with oil and salt and pepper to taste and spread in one layer in pan. Roast potatoes until golden, about 20 minutes. Potatoes may be roasted 8 hours ahead and kept covered at room temperature.
In a small saucepan, heat oil, garlic paste, and anchovy paste over moderate heat, stirring, until warm and stir in parsley.
On a platter, toss peppers and potatoes with warm bagna cauda to coat and season with salt and pepper.

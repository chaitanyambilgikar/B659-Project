1. Dissolve the active dry yeast along with the sugar in the water in a large glass container. Mix and let sit about 10 minutes.
2. In a large bowl mix 5 cups of the flour with the salt. Add the yeast mixture and the vegetable oil. Work the ingredients together with a spoon; when they come together turn out on a floured board, and knead with your hands until the dough becomes a smooth ball. Place in a greased bowl and let rise, covered, for an hour or so or until doubled.
3. Punch down and divide into 4 balls. Cover with a towel and let rise about a half hour.
4. Meanwhile, place 4 empty round baking pans or cookie sheets in a preheated 400-degree oven for about 10 minutes and remove.
5. When the dough has risen, punch down and divide into 4 balls. At this point you can treat this like everyday or Sabbath bread. For weekdays, press down and stretch, using the back of your hand. Grease the baking pans and press the dough down into them. Using your fingers, make big indentations in the center of the dough. For Sabbath bread, keep the shape in a round and make a few slashes in the bread. Sprinkle the dough, whatever the shape, with water and bake in the oven for about 20 minutes or until the loaf sounds hollow when tapped with a spatula.

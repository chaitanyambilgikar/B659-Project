Heat oil in heavy large pot over high heat. Add root vegetables and onions; sauté until beginning to brown, about 10 minutes. Add vegetable broth and herbes de Provence; bring to boil. Add bulgur; cover pot and reduce heat to low. Simmer until bulgur is almost tender, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes. Add spinach; stir until wilted, about 1 minute. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

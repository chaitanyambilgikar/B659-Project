Place tuna in shallow glass dish. Pour marinade over and turn to coat. Let tuna stand 10 minutes at room temperature, or cover and refrigerate 1 hour. Mix butter, wasabi powder, and chives in small bowl.
Prepare barbecue (medium heat). Remove tuna from marinade; brush on both sides with oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill fish, brushing occasionally with remaining marinade, about 2 minutes per side for medium-rare. Transfer to platter. Top with wasabi butter and serve.

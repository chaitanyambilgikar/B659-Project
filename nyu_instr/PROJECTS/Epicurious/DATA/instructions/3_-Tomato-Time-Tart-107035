1. Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface. Cut each sheet into an 8-inch circle, using a salad-size plate as a guide. Remove to an ungreased baking sheet. Prick the pastry all over with a fork.
2. Whisk together the egg yolks, corn oil, and water; brush lightly on the pastry. Arrange the tomatoes in concentric circles, leaving a 1/2-inch edge.
3. Preheat the oven to 400°F. Drizzle the tarts evenly with the olive oil, sugar, and pepper. Bake about 25 minutes or until the tarts are golden and the tomatoes are caramelized.
4. Serve immediately, with a dollop of Garden Pesto .

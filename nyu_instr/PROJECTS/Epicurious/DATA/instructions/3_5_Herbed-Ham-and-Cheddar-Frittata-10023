In an 8- or 9-inch flameproof heavy skillet cook scallions and garlic in oil over moderately low heat, stirring, until softened. In a bowl whisk together eggs, thyme, rosemary, and pepper to taste. Add egg mixture to scallion mixture and cook, without stirring, 2 minutes. Add ham and cook, without stirring, 8 minutes, or until edges are set but center is still soft.
While frittata is cooking, preheat broiler.
Sprinkle Cheddar on frittata and broil about 4 inches from heat until cheese is bubbling, about 1 minute. Sprinkle with parsley and cut into wedges.

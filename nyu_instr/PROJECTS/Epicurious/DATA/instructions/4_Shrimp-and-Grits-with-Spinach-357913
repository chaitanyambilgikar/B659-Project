Bring milk, 1 garlic clove, and salt to boil in medium saucepan. Gradually whisk in grits. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until grits are very tender, whisking often, about 8 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Meanwhile, cook bacon in large nonstick skillet over medium heat until crisp, stirring often. Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towels to drain. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon drippings. Add shrimp to drippings in skillet. Sauté until shrimp are pink, stirring often, about 1 minute. Sprinkle shrimp with salt and pepper. Add shallots and remaining garlic to skillet. Sauté until shallots are translucent and shrimp are cooked through, about 2 minutes. Add clam juice to skillet and bring to boil, scraping up any browned bits. Add spinach to skillet and toss just to wilt. Season to taste with salt, pepper, and hot pepper sauce.
Divide grits among 6 plates. Top with shrimp mixture and sprinkle with bacon. Garnish with lemon wedges for squeezing over and serve.

In a small bowl stir together egg white or reconstituted dried whites and water and brush onto leaves to lightly coat both sides. In a bowl toss leaves with sugar and transfer to a rack. Let leaves stand about 6 hours, or until dry. Leaves may be made 1 day ahead and kept in an airtight container at room temperature.

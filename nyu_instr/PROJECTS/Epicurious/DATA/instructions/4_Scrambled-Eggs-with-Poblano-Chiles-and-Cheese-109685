Melt 2 tablespoons butter in large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion, garlic, and oregano and sauté until onion is soft, about 3 minutes. Add tomatoes with juice and chili powder. Cover and simmer 5 minutes to blend flavors. Transfer sauce to blender; puree until smooth. Season with salt and pepper. Return sauce to pan and keep warm.
Melt remaining 4 tablespoons butter in large skillet over medium heat. Add chiles; sauté until tender, about 6 minutes. Add green onions and 1/4 cup cilantro. Add eggs and cheese. Cook until eggs are softly set, stirring occasionally, about 4 minutes. Divide eggs among 4 plates. Spoon sauce over; sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup cilantro.

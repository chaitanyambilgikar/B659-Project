Preheat oven to 350°F. Line ten 1/3-cup muffin cups with foil muffin papers. Whisk first 5 ingredients in large bowl to blend. Stir both flours and sugar in medium bowl until no sugar lumps remain. Mix in granola, baking powder, nutmeg and salt. Add pear; toss to coat. Stir flour mixture into egg mixture just to blend (batter will be thick). Divide among prepared muffin cups, mounding in center.
Bake muffins until golden brown and tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Transfer muffins to rack and cool.

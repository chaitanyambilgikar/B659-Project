Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter 8-inch square baking dish. Place sausage and bell pepper in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Sauté until sausage is cooked through and pepper is tender, breaking sausage into small pieces with back of spoon, about 10 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer sausage and pepper to small bowl.
Layer half of bread, stuffing mix, sausage mixture and cheese in prepared dish. Repeat layering. Combine eggs, milk and salt in small bowl and whisk until blended; season with pepper. Pour egg mixture over sausage mixture.
Bake until casserole begins to brown and custard is set, about 40 minutes.
Meanwhile, bring tomatoes with juices to boil in heavy medium saucepan over high heat. Cook until tomatoes thicken to sauce consistency, stirring occasionally, about 9 minutes.
Spoon soufflé onto plates. Spoon tomato sauce alongside and serve.

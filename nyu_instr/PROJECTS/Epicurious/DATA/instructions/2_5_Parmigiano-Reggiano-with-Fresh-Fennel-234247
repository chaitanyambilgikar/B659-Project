Pry off bite-size chunks of cheese with a Parmigiano-Reggiano knife or the point of a small sharp stiff knife and put on a platter.
Trim fennel, discarding stalks and outer layer if bruised. Halve bulbs lengthwise and core, then cut into 1/4-inch-wide slivers.
Just before serving, tuck clusters of fennel among cheese chunks.

Preheat oven to 350°F. Oil 13x9x2-inch roasting pan. Mix melted butter, parsley and 2 tablespoons mustard in medium bowl. Mix breadcrumbs.
Spread remaining 1 tablespoon mustard on both sides of pork chops. Sprinkle pork chops with salt and pepper. Arrange in prepared roasting pan.
Press 1/4 of breadcrumb mixture atop each pork chop. Bake pork chops until cooked through, about 35 minutes.
Preheat broiler. Broil pork chops, crust side up, until golden brown, watching closely to avoid burning, about 2 minutes. Serve immediately.

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Spoon 2 tablespoons teriyaki sauce onto plate. Add steak; turn to coat. Sprinkle steak with pepper; let stand 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, whisk oil, lime juice, dark brown sugar, grated lime peel and remaining 4 teaspoons teriyaki sauce in small bowl to blend. Season dressing with salt and pepper. Transfer half of dressing to medium bowl; mix in cabbage, red onion and mint. Divide mixture between 2 plates.
Grill sirloin steak until cooked to desired doneness, about 5 minutes per side for medium-rare. Transfer steak to cutting board; slice thinly. Arrange steak slices atop cabbage mixture. Drizzle remaining dressing and any steak juices on board over each salad and serve.

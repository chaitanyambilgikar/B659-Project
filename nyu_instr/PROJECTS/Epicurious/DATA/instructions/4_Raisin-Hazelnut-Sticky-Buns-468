Combine nuts and 2/3 cup brown sugar in processor; grind finely. Add 6 tablespoons butter and cinnamon; process to blend. Transfer to bowl; stir in raisins.
Butter sixteen 1/3-cup muffin cups. Mix remaining 6 tablespoons sugar and 6 tablespoons butter in small bowl. Place 2 teaspoons butter mixture in each prepared muffin cup. Roll out dough on floured work surface to 16x12-inch rectangle, pulling and stretching dough if necessary. Spread filling evenly over dough, leaving 1/2-inch border on all sides. Starting at 1 long side, roll up tightly in jelly roll fashion. Cut roll crosswise into 16 slices. Arrange slices cut side up atop butter mixture in prepared muffin cups. Cover with towel and let rise in warm draft-free area until puffed and almost doubled in volume, about 45 minutes.
Meanwhile, position 1 rack in center and 1 rack in lowest third of oven and preheat to 400°F. Place muffin pans with sticky buns on center rack; position baking sheet on the lowest rack to catch any drips. Bake until sticky buns are golden, about 15 minutes. Immediately turn out of pans. Serve warm.

Heat oven to 400°F. Slice potatoes in half lengthwise; cut each half into 1/4- to 1/2-inch-thick fries; pat dry with a paper towel. In a bowl, combine breadcrumbs with spices. In another bowl, whisk egg whites until foamy, about 1 minute; add fries to coat. Toss fries in spice mixture until evenly coated. Coat a baking sheet with cooking spray; arrange fries on sheet with space in between; spritz fries with cooking spray. Bake, turning once, until fries are golden and crispy, about 20 minutes.

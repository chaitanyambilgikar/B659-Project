Peel potatoes and in a 3- to 4-quart saucepan cover with salted cold water by 2 inches. Simmer potatoes until just tender, 12 to 15 minutes, and drain in a colander.
While potatoes are cooking, in a small heavy skillet dry-roast seeds over moderate heat, shaking skillet, until fragrant and slightly darker, being careful not to burn them, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer seeds to a small bowl and cool. With mortar and pestle or in an electric coffee/spice grinder grind seeds coarse.
In a heavy skillet melt butter over moderately low heat and add potatoes, stirring and shaking skillet to coat. Sprinkle potatoes with ground seeds, parsley, and salt and pepper to taste and stir, shaking skillet occasionally, to coat.

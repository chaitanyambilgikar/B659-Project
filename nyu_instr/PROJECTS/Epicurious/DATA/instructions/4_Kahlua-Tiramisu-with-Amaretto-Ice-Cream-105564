Sprinkle gelatin over Marsala in medium metal bowl. Let stand 5 minutes to soften. Whisk in egg yolks and 1/2 cup sugar. Set bowl over saucepan of simmering water (do not allow bottom of bowl to touch water). Whisk constantly until candy thermometer registers 165°F, about 5 minutes. Remove bowl from over water. Gradually add mascarpone, whisking vigorously until well blended. Beat whipping cream with remaining 1/4 cup sugar in large bowl to peaks. Fold into mascarpone mixture.
Whisk 1 cup hot water, Kahlúa, and espresso powder in another medium bowl to blend. Dip half of Champagne biscuits, 1 at a time, into coffee mixture. Place enough dipped biscuits over bottom of 9-inch-diameter springform pan to cover, cutting biscuits to fit if necessary. Pour half of mascarpone mousse over ladyfingers. Dip remaining biscuits into coffee mixture, 1 at a time, and arrange atop mousse. Spoon remaining mascarpone mixture over. Sift 2 tablespoons cocoa powder over. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. Release pan sides. Cut into wedges and serve with Amaretto Ice Cream.

Boil diced potatoes in lightly salted water until fork-tender. Drain and set aside in a bowl. Cut bacon into small pieces and brown lightly in frying pan over medium heat. Add onions and cook until bacon is browned and onions are golden, about 5 minutes. Mix 3 tablespoons sugar in diluted vinegar and taste; add more sugar if you like a sweeter dressing. Add vinegar and sugar to pan and stir until liquid is heated. Add mixture to diced potatoes and toss gently. Garnish with a few leaves of chopped parsley, if desired, and serve warm.

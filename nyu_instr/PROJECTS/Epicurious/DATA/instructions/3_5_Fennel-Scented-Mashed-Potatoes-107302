Bring large pot of salted water to boil. Add fennel bulbs; cook until slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Add potatoes and boil gently until fennel and potatoes are very tender, about 25 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine 1/2 cup half and half, fennel seeds, and tarragon in small saucepan; bring to simmer. Remove from heat; cover to keep warm.
Drain potato mixture; return to pot. Stir over medium heat until any excess liquid evaporates, about 2 minutes. Add hot half and half mixture and butter and mash until vegetables are almost smooth (small fennel bits may still remain). Season to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be made 8 hours ahead; cover and chill. Rewarm covered with plastic wrap in microwave, stirring occasionally and thinning with more half and half, if desired.)
Transfer mashed potato mixture to bowl. Sprinkle with reserved chopped fennel fronds and serve.

1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230C).
2. In a medium-sized mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs and the milk. Season generously with salt and pepper.
3. Lay the slices of cheese evenly over the bottom of the pastry shell. Pour the egg mixture over the cheese, and bake in the center of the oven until golden and puffed, 25 to 30 minutes.
4. Remove from the oven, separate the tart from the mold, and transfer it to a serving platter. Serve immediately.

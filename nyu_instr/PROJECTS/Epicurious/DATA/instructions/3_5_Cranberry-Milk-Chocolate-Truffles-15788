Make truffle mixture: Chop chocolate. In a small saucepan bring cream, butter and salt just to a boil and stir in cranberries. Remove pan from heat and let mixture stand 10 minutes. In a food processor pulse together chocolate and cranberry mixture until smooth and transfer to a small bowl. Chill truffle mixture, covered, until very firm, at least 12 hours, and up to 3 days.
Line a tray with wax paper.
With a 1-inch melon-ball cutter scoop out truffle mixture and between palms of your hands roll into smooth balls, transferring truffles to tray. Chill truffles until firm, about 3 hours. Bring truffles to room temperature, about 20 minutes, before proceeding.
Coat and decorate truffles: Oil a baking sheet and line with parchment paper.
Temper chocolate . (Alternatively, chop chocolate and in a double boiler or a small metal bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water melt chocolate, stirring until smooth.)
Balance 1 truffle on a fork (do not spear) and hold fork over chocolate. Spoon chocolate over ball, letting excess drip off. Return truffle to tray and top with a small piece of dried cranberry. Coat and decorate remaining truffles in same manner. Chill truffles, uncovered, until set, about 3 hours. Truffles keep, layered between sheets of wax paper in an airtight container and chilled, 2 weeks. Bring truffles to room temperature before serving.

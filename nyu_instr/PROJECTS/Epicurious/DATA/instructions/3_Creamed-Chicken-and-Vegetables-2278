Melt butter in heavy large pot over medium heat. Add leeks, carrots, potatoes, herbs and garlic. Sauté until vegetables begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Add 1 3/4 cups broth; bring to boil. Cover pot, reduce heat to low and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes.
Mix condensed soup and cream into vegetables. Add chicken. Simmer until heated through, thinning with additional broth by 1/4 cupfuls, if desired about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.

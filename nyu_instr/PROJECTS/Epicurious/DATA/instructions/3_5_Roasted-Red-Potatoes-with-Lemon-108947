Preheat oven to 350°F. Place potatoes on large rimmed baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper; toss to coat. Roast potatoes until golden brown and tender, stirring occasionally, about 1 hour. Sprinkle with lemon juice and lemon peel; stir. Roast 1 minute longer. Serve warm.

Toss cheese and paprika in large bowl.
Spray small nonstick skillet with nonstick spray. Place over medium-low heat. Drop 1/4 cup cheese mixture in mound in center of skillet. Spread to 3- to 4-inch round. Cook until completely melted, bubbling all over, and browning at edges, about 1 1/2 minutes. Remove pan from heat; let stand until bubbling stops. Loosen edges and turn frico over. Return pan to medium-low heat and cook frico until golden on bottom, about 1 minute. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Repeat with remaining cheese mixture. DO AHEAD: Can be made 4 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.
WHAT TO DRINK: Salty, smoky flavors need a crisp Pinot Grigio like the 2005 Blason (Italy, $9).
*Sometimes labeled Pimentón Dulce or Pimentón de La Vera Dulce; available at some supermarkets, at specialty foods stores, and from tienda.com.

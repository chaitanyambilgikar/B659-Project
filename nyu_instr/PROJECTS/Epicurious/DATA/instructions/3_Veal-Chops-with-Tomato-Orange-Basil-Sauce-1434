Combine first 3 ingredients and 1 tablespoon orange peel in heavy small saucepan. Boil until mixture is reduced to 3 tablespoons, about 10 minutes. Add cream and boil 1 minute. Set sauce aside. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
Melt 1 tablespoon butter in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Season veal with salt and pepper. Sauté veal until just cooked through, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer to plates; keep warm.
Reheat sauce over low heat. Whisk in remaining 4 tablespoons butter. Stir in tomato, sliced basil and remaining 1 tablespoon orange peel. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Ladle sauce over veal. Garnish with basil sprigs if desired.

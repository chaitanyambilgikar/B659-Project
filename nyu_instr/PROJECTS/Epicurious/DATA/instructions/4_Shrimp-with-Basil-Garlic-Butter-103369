Preheat oven to 350°F.
Season shrimp with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and sauté shrimp 1 minute per side. Transfer shrimp to a baking dish and bake in middle of oven until just cooked through, about 7 minutes.
While shrimp bakes, add garlic to skillet and cook, stirring, over moderate heat 15 seconds, then stir in wine, juice, and tomatoes. Boil, stirring occasionally, until liquid is reduced by two thirds. Swirl in butter and basil over low heat and season with salt and pepper.
Serve shrimp with sauce.

Preheat oven to 300°F. Place baking sheet in oven. Whisk first 5 ingredients in large bowl. Whisk milk, eggs, and vanilla in medium bowl, then whisk in 1/4 cup butter. Stir milk mixture into dry ingredients.
Heat large nonstick griddle or skillet over medium heat; brush with butter. For each pancake, drop 1/4 cup batter onto griddle. Arrange 3 banana rounds and 3 pecan halves on each pancake. Cook until brown, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to baking sheet in oven. Repeat with remaining batter, bananas, and pecans. Serve with syrup and butter.

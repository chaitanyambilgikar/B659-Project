Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms; sauté until tender and beginning to brown, about 10 minutes. Add bacon, green onions and capers; toss to combine. Add vermicelli, 1 cup Parmesan, cream and pine nuts; toss until sauce thickens and coats pasta and mixture is heated through. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer pasta to large shallow bowl.

Grate zucchini using medium shredding disk of a food processor. Transfer to a bowl and toss with 2 teaspoons salt. Let stand 30 minutes.
Squeeze zucchini in batches in a kitchen towel to remove as much liquid as possible. Transfer zucchini to a large bowl and stir in bread crumbs, eggs, marjoram, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.
Preheat oven to 200°F.
Heat 1/3 cup oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium heat until it shimmers. Scoop 2 tablespoon mixture per latke into skillet (6 to 8 per batch). Flatten with a fork to form 2 1/2-to 3-inch pancakes. Fry until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side (adding more oil as necessary). Transfer to a paper-towel-lined baking sheet and keep warm in oven.

Place 1/2 cup warm milk and 1 teaspoon sugar in large bowl; sprinkle yeast over and stir to blend. Let stand until yeast dissolves and mixture looks foamy, about 5 minutes. Mix in 1/2 cup flour to form soft sponge. Cover sponge and let stand until very light and bubbly, about 30 minutes.
Whisk eggs, honey, butter, lemon and orange peel, salt, remaining 1/4 cup milk, and 6 tablespoons sugar in medium bowl to blend. Stir egg mixture into sponge. Mix in 3 cups flour, 1 cup at a time, to form soft dough. Mix in additional flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, until dough is soft and just barely sticky. Turn out onto floured work surface. Knead dough until smooth and elastic, sprinkling with more flour by tablespoonfuls if still sticky, about 8 minutes.
Butter another large bowl. Form dough into ball. Place in bowl; turn to coat. Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Let dough rise in warm draft-free area until doubled in volume, about 1 1/2 hours.
Gently press dough down. Sprinkle with all fruits and nuts; knead in bowl to distribute evenly.

In a small heavy skillet heat oil over moderate heat until hot but not smoking and cook chilies, fennel seeds, cumin, coriander seeds, and coconut, stirring, until coconut is golden, about 5 minutes, being careful not to burn them. In a blender blend spice mixture with remaining chutney ingredients until smooth. Chill chutney, covered, at least until cold, about 2 hours, and up to 2 days.

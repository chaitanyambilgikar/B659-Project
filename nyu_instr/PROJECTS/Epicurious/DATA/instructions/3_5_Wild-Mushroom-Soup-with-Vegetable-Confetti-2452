Cut off dark green tops from leeks and reserve for soup. Cut white and pale green sections lengthwise in half. Rinse any dirt from leeks with cold water. Cut halves into 1-inch pieces. Place in 8- to 10-quart pot. Add chicken wings.
Add water, carrots, onion, thyme, peppercorns and bay leaves to pot. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium. Simmer 2 hours 15 minutes, occasionally skimming foam from surface. Strain stock through fine sieve into large bowl.
Chill stock until fat hardens on surface, about 2 hours. Spoon off fat and discard. Measure stock. If necessary, simmer in large saucepan until reduced to 8 cups. (Can be made ahead. Cover and refrigerate up to 2 days or freeze up to 2 weeks.)

Heat oil in heavy large saucepan over medium-low heat. Add shallots and garlic; stir 1 minute. Add 1/3 of wild mushrooms and all of white mushrooms. Sauté until mushrooms release liquid, about 8 minutes. Add curry powder; sauté until mushrooms are tender, about 4 minutes. Add saffron mixture and 6 cups stock. Simmer until mushrooms are tender, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat.
Puree cooked mushrooms and 1 cup mushroom broth in processor until almost smooth. Return mushroom puree to saucepan with broth. Simmer soup 15 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover soup loosely with foil and refrigerate.)
Finely dice enough of green leek tops reserved from stock to measure 1/3 cup. Cook leek, carrot and turnip in saucepan of boiling salted water until tender, about 1 minute. Drain. Refresh under cold water; drain. (Vegetable confetti can be made up to 2 hours ahead. Pat dry; cover and let stand at room temperature.)
Melt butter in large skillet over medium-high heat. Add remaining wild mushrooms; sauté until tender, about 8 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.

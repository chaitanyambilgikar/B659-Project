Reduce heat to low; cook, turning once or twice, until steak is well browned and center is pink, about 15 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board. Carefully wipe skillet; coat with cooking spray. Cook eggs over high heat sunny-side up, 3 minutes. Toast tortillas in a toaster oven; transfer 1 tortilla to each of 4 plates.

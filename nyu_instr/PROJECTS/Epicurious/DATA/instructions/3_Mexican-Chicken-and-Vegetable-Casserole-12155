In a small bowl whisk together the cumin, the chili powder, the cinnamon, the vinegar, 1 of the garlic cloves, minced and mashed to a paste with a pinch of salt, 1 tablespoon of the oil, salt and pepper to taste, coating the chicken with the spice paste, and grill it on an oiled grill set about 6 inches over glowing coals or in an oiled ridged grill pan set over moderately high heat, turning it once, for 12 to 15 minutes on each side, or until it is cooked through.
While the chicken is cooking, in a skillet cook the onion in the remaining 2 tablespoons oil over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until it is lightly golden, add the remaining 2 garlic cloves, minced, and the tomatoes, and cook the mixture over moderately low heat, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. Add the zucchini, the broth, the jalapeño, the bell pepper, the corn, the orégano, salt and pepper to taste and simmer the mixture, stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes, or until the zucchini and bell pepper are tender.
In a large flameproof shallow casserole combine the zucchini mixture and the chicken, sprinkle Monterey Jack over the top, and broil the mixture under a preheated broiler about 6 inches from the heat for 1 minute, or until the cheese is bubbling.

Make the shortcakes: Preheat the oven to 425°F. Into a bowl sift together the flour, 3 tablespoons of sugar, the baking powder, and a pinch of salt and stir in zest. In a bowl with an electric mixer beat 1 cup of the cream with the vanilla until it just holds soft peaks. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture, add the whipped cream, and with a fork combine the mixture until it just forms a dough. On a lightly floured surface knead the dough 6 times, or until it is just combined well, roll or pat it out 1/2 inch thick, and with a floured 4-inch cutter cut out a total of 6 rounds, gathering and rerolling the scraps. Brush the rounds with the additional cream or the milk and sprinkle them with the additional sugar. Bake the shortcakes on a greased baking sheet in the middle of the oven for 12 to 15 minutes, or until they are golden, transfer them with a spatula to a rack, and let them cool.
Make the caramel apples: In a dry heavy skillet cook 1/2 cup of the sugar over moderate heat, undisturbed, until it begins to melt and cook the sugar, stirring with a fork, until it is melted completely and turns a golden caramel. Remove the skillet from the heat and whisk in the cream carefully. Return the skillet to the heat and whisk the caramel sauce until it is smooth. In a large heavy skillet cook the apples, each peeled, cored, and cut into 8 slices, in the butter over moderately high heat, stirring, until they are browned lightly, add the remaining 1 tablespoon sugar, and cook the apples until they are soft and caramelized. Add the sauce to the apples and stir the mixture carefully.
Break each shortcake in half, arrange 2 halves on each of 6 dessert plates, and spoon the apples over them.

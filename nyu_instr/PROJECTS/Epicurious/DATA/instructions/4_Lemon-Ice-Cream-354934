Combine heavy whipping cream, whole milk, 1 cup sugar, and grated lemon peel in heavy large saucepan. Bring mixture to simmer over medium heat, stirring until sugar dissolves. Remove from heat. Whisk egg yolks, fresh lemon juice, and remaining 1/4 cup sugar in large heatproof bowl to blend. Gradually whisk in hot cream mixture. Return mixture to saucepan. Stir over medium heat until custard thickens slightly and instant-read thermometer inserted into mixture registers 170°F to 175°F, about 5 minutes (do not boil). Strain custard into clean bowl; cover and chill until cold, about 3 hours.
Transfer custard to ice cream maker and process according to manufacturer's instructions. Transfer ice cream to freezer container. Cover and freeze until firm. DO AHEAD: Ice cream can be made 5 days ahead. Keep frozen.

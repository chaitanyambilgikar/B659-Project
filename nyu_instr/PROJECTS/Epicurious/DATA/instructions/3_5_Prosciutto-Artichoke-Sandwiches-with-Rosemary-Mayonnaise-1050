Preheat broiler. Mix mayonnaise, rosemary and lemon juice in small bowl. Season generously with pepper. Spread mayonnaise over cut sides of bread. Place bottom slices on broilerproof pan. Arrange artichokes over bread, dividing equally. Top with prosciutto slice, then with cheese slices.
Broil sandwiches about 6 inches from heat source until cheese melts and is golden, about 3 minutes. Close sandwiches; cut sandwiches in half and serve.

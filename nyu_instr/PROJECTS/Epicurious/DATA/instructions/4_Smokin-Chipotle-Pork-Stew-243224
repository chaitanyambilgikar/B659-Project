1. Heat a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat until very hot, about two minutes. Add the oil. Add the pork and cook, in batches if necessary, until browned on all sides. Transfer the pork to a bowl and set aside.
2. Reduce the heat to low. Add the onions, stirring to scrape up the browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Cover with a tight-fitting lid and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are golden and slightly browned around the edges, about 10 minutes. Add the reserved pork, beer, chipotles, adobo sauce, cumin, salt, and pepper; stir until combined. Simmer, covered, stirring occasionally, until the pork is fork-tender, about 1 1/2 hours.

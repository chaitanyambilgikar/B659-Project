Make chutney: Purée chutney ingredients in a blender, stirring occasionally to assist blending, and transfer to a bowl. Season chutney with salt and pepper and chill, covered, until ready to use.
Make scallops: Remove muscle from side of scallops if still attached. Pat scallops dry and season with salt and pepper. Whisk together eggs and milk in a shallow bowl. Put panko in another shallow bowl. Dip scallops, 1 at a time, in egg mixture and then in panko, turning to coat, and transfer to a tray.
Preheat oven to 400°F.
Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderate heat until hot but not smoking, then cook scallops, 12 at a time, until just cooked through and golden brown (adjust heat if necessary), about 1 1/2 minutes on each side. Put scallops as cooked in 1 layer on a rack set in a shallow baking pan. Between batches, carefully wipe skillet clean with paper towels and add more oil. Bake scallops in middle of oven until just heated through, about 3 minutes.
Serve scallops topped with chutney.

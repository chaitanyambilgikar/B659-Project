1. Boil the potatoes in their jackets until tender but not cracked open. Drain. When cool enough to handle, quarter the potatoes. Leave the skin on.
2. Heat the oil in a large heavy nonstick sauté pan over medium-high heat. Add the cumin seeds and sauté until they turn several shades darker, about 1 minute. Add the tumeric and potatoes and sauté, tossing frequently, until the potatoes are nicely browned., about 10 minutes.
3. Sprinkle with fresh coriander and serve hot, at room temperature, or cold.

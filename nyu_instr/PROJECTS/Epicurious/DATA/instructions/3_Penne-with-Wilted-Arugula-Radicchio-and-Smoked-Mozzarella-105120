Cook pasta in a 6-quart pot of well-salted boiling water until al dente.
While pasta is boiling, whisk together oil, zest, garlic, and salt and pepper to taste in a large bowl. Then thinly slice radicchio, arugula, and basil and add to dressing.
Reserve 1/2 cup cooking water and drain pasta in a colander.
Add hot pasta and reserved cooking water to greens and let stand 1 minute to wilt.
Add mozzarella and lemon juice and toss well. Season with salt and pepper and serve warm.

Line large baking sheet with waxed paper. Wipe strawberries clean; dry with paper towels.
Stir chocolate chips and shortening in top of double boiler set over simmering water until chocolate melts and mixture is smooth. Place chocolate sprinkles in shallow bowl. Holding 1 strawberry by its green top, dip 3/4 of berry into melted chocolate. Let excess chocolate drip off, then dip into chocolate sprinkles. Place on waxed-paper-lined sheet. Repeat dipping remaining strawberries into chocolate, then into sprinkles. Refrigerate until chocolate coating is firm, about 1 hour. (Can be prepared 8 hours ahead. Keep refrigerated.)

Preheat broiler. Place lavash on large baking sheet; brush with 1 1/2 tablespoons oil. Broil until lavash just begins to crisp, about 1 minute.
Reduce oven temperature to 450°F. Turn lavash over on baking sheet, broiled side down. Brush with remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons oil. Spread with olives; sprinkle with Monterey Jack cheese and feta cheese, then mushrooms, onion, bell pepper, and tomatoes. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Bake until pizza is heated through and cheeses melt, about 10 minutes. Cut into squares.

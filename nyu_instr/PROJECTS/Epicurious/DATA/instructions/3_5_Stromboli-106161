Preheat oven to 400°F.
Quarter dough. Roll out 1 piece into a 10-inch round on a lightly floured surface and sprinkle evenly with 1 tablespoon parmesan and black pepper to taste. Arrange one fourth each of salami, provolone, and roasted peppers in an even layer over dough. Roll up dough round, then tuck ends under and pinch edges to seal.
Make 3 more rolls in same manner and arrange 2 inches apart on a lightly greased baking sheet. Brush lightly with egg and cut 3 (1/2-inch) steam vents in each roll. Bake in middle of oven until golden, 30 to 35 minutes.

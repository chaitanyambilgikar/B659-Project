Sprinkle steaks with salt and pepper. Melt butter in heavy medium skillet over medium heat. Add steaks and sauté until brown and cooked to desired doneness, about 6 minutes per side for medium-rare. Using tongs, transfer steaks to plate; tent with foil to keep warm.
Add shallots and peppercorns to skillet. Sauté until shallots soften, about 2 minutes. Add broth, mustard and cream, then brandy; boil until sauce thickens enough to coat spoon, about 7 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
Cut steaks crosswise into scant 1/2-inch-thick slices. Overlap slices on 2 plates; spoon sauce alongside and serve.

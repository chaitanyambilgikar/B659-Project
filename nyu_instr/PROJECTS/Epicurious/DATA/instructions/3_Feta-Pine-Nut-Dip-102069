Preheat oven to 350°F.
In a shallow baking pan toast pine nuts, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 7 minutes, and transfer to a plate to cool. Separately chop nuts, bell pepper, and parsley and combine in a bowl.
Crumble feta into a food processor and pulse until it resembles coarse meal. Stir feta into nut mixture with garlic, yogurt, and salt and pepper to taste. Serve dip with pita toasts or bagel chips. Makes about 2 cups.

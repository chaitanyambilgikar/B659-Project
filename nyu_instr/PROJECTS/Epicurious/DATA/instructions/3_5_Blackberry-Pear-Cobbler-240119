Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter 2 1/2- quart baking dish with 2-inch-high sides. Gently toss berries, pears, 2/3 cup sugar, wine, peel, and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon in medium bowl.
Whisk flour, baking powder, salt, and remaining 3/4 cup sugar in another medium bowl. Add milk, melted butter, and almond extract; whisk until blended. Spread batter in prepared dish. Place berry-pear mixture atop batter (do not stir). Sprinkle with additional cinnamon.
Bake cobbler until crust is set in center and brown at edges, about 1 hour. Cool 30 minutes. Dust with powdered sugar; serve warm with ice cream, if desired.
GOOD TO KNOW: Why not stir the fruit into the batter? Left undisturbed, the batter puffs up around the fruit during baking, forming a crusty edge.

Mix chili powder and brown sugar in small bowl to blend. Rub mixture over steak. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Combine tomatoes, olives, 2 tablespoons oil and vinegar in processor. Using on/off turns, blend just until olives are coarsely chopped. Transfer to bowl. Stir in onion. Season relish with salt and pepper. (Steak and relish can be prepared 6 hours ahead. Cover separately; chill.)
Heat 2 teaspoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add steak and cook to desired doneness, about 3 minutes per side for medium-rare. Transfer steak to plate. Let stand 5 minutes. Wipe out skillet.
Brush 1 side of each bread slice with remaining 3 tablespoons oil. Heat same skillet over medium heat. Add bread, oiled side down, to skillet and cook until golden, about 2 minutes per side.
Cut steak across grain into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Spread relish generously over oiled side of 4 toasts. Top with watercress, then steak slices. Top with a bit more relish, then remaining toasts.

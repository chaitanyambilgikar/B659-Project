Butter four 8-ounce ramekins. In food processor, finely grind chocolate. Add butter and sugar and process until thoroughly combined. Add flour, 1/4 cup of heavy cream, eggs, vanilla, cinnamon, baking powder, salt, and cloves, and process until smooth.
Divide mixture evenly among ramekins and cover tightly with plastic wrap. (Batter can be made ahead and regfrigerated in ramekins, covered with plastic wrap, up to 6 hours.)
Leaving plastic wrap in place, microwave ramekins on high for 1 minute 20 seconds. Remove from microwave and pierce plastic wrap with tip of sharp knife. Cover each ramekin with heavy plate and let stand, steaming, 7 minutes.
While cakes are steaming, beat remaining 1/2 cup cream in large bowl until foamy and slightly opaque. Add confectioner's sugar and beat until soft peaks form.
Remove plate and plastic wrap from each ramekin. Invert each cake onto individual serving plate and unmold. Top each with dollop of whipped cream, sprinkle with additional cinnamon, and serve.

In medium saucepan over moderate heat, heat oil until hot but not smoking. Add onion, garlic, and pepper and sauté until just tender, 6 to 7 minutes. Add wine, marjoram, thyme, and basil and simmer, uncovered, until reduced by half, about 10 minutes. Add tomatoes, tomato paste, and 3/4 cup water to pot and simmer, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 30 minutes. (Sauce can be made ahead and refrigerated up to 3 days.)

In a bowl sift together the flour, the sugar, the baking powder, the salt, and the baking soda and stir in the oats and the prunes. In another bowl whisk together the buttermilk, the butter, the molasses, and the egg, add the mixture to the flour mixture, and stir the batter until it is just combined. Divide the batter among 12 well-buttered 1/3-cup muffin tins and bake the muffins in the middle of a preheated 400°F. oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until they are golden and springy to the touch. Turn the muffins out onto a rack and let them cool.

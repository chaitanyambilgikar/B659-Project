Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Combine garlic, tomatoes, chiles, and shallots in medium bowl. Add oil and toss to coat. Arrange vegetables on barbecue; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill until charred, turning occasionally, about 8 minutes. Using tongs, transfer garlic and vegetables to plate and cool.
Peel garlic; chop coarsely. Chop tomatoes. Cut chiles in half lengthwise; discard seeds and chop chiles coarsely. Chop shallots. Combine all vegetables in medium bowl. Add cilantro and lime juice. Blend well; season with salt and pepper. (Salsa can be made 8 hours ahead. Cover and chill. Bring to room temperature and stir before using.)
Transfer salsa to serving bowl; place on platter. Surround with rice crackers.

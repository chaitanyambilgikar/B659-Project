Cook bacon in heavy large pot over medium heat until fat is rendered, about 8 minutes. Using slotted spoon, remove bacon and reserve. Cut green part off leeks and reserve. Halve leeks lengthwise, then slice crosswise. Add sliced leeks, parsnips, potatoes, onion, turnip and bay leaf to pot and cook until vegetables begin to soften, stirring frequently, about 15 minutes. Add beef broth, chicken broth and cabbage and bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer 20 minutes. Return bacon to pot and cook 10 minutes longer. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Bring to simmer before serving.) Thinly slice pale green part of reserved leeks. Ladle stew into bowls. Top with sliced leeks and parsley and serve.

Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 400°F.
Purée tomatoes with their juice in a blender. Heat oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat until hot but not smoking, then cook garlic, spices, and 3/4 teaspoon salt, stirring, until garlic is golden, about 1 minute. Add tomato purée and sugar and briskly simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, 6 to 8 minutes.
Pour sauce into a 13- by 9-inch baking dish. Pat fish dry and sprinkle with remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. Arrange fillets in 1 layer on sauce, tucking each tail end under if necessary to fit, and bake until fish is just cooked through, 10 to 12 minutes. Serve sprinkled with parsley.

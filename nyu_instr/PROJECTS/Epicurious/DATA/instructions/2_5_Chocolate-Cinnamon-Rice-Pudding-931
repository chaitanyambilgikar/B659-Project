Mix 4 cups milk, rice, sugar and cinnamon sticks in heavy large saucepan. Cook over medium-low heat until rice is tender and mixture is very thick, stirring often, about 45 minutes. Remove from heat. Discard cinnamon sticks.
Whisk egg yolks and remaining 1/2 cup milk in medium bowl. Whisk in some of hot rice mixture. Return egg mixture to remaining rice mixture. Stir over medium-low heat until the thermometer registers 160°F., about 3 minutes (do not boil). Remove from heat. Add chocolate and stir until melted and smooth. Stir in vanilla. Transfer pudding to large bowl. Cover and refrigerate until well chilled, at least 4 hours or overnight. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Keep refrigerated.) Serve cold.

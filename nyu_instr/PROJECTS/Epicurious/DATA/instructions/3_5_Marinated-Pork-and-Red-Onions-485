Thread two pieces of pork and 2 pieces of onion alternately on each skewer. Season with salt and pepper. Arrange kebabs in 13x9x2-inch glass baking dish.
Whisk all remaining ingredients in medium bowl. Pour marinade over kebabs. Let stand up to 2 hours at room temperature or cover and refrigerate up to 1 day, turning occasionally.
Preheat broiler. Drain marinade into small saucepan. Broil kebabs until pork is cooked through, turning frequently and basting occasionally with marinade, about 12 minutes.

Rub chicken with 1 tablespoon oil, oregano, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper and marinate at room temperature 30 minutes.
Whisk together vinegar, garlic, 3/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper and add 1/4 cup oil in a slow stream, whisking until emulsified. Drizzle cut sides of bread with half of dressing and toss roasted peppers with remainder.
Heat grill pan over moderately high heat until hot, then grill chicken, turning over once, until just cooked through, 4 to 6 minutes total. Make sandwiches with chicken, peppers, and watercress.

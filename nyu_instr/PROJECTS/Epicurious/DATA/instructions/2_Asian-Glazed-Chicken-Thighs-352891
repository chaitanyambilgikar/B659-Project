1. The day before serving, rinse the chicken and pat dry. Place in a bowl.
2. Combine the next 8 ingredients to make a marinade; toss with the chicken to coat. Cover and refrigerate for 4 to 6 hours, or overnight.
3. Thirty minutes before cooking, remove the chicken from the refrigerator and preheat the oven to 350°F. Arrange the chicken in a large, shallow roasting pan and season with salt and pepper to taste. Pour the marinade over the chicken.
4. Bake the chicken until it’s golden brown and cooked through, basting frequently, about 45 minutes.
5. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Turn off the heat and stir in the rice noodles. Let soak until tender, about 7 minutes. Drain, rinse under warm water, and drain again.
6. Divide the noodles between 4 bowls. Place 2 chicken thighs in each bowl and spoon the pan sauce over the top. Garnish with scallions and serve immediately.

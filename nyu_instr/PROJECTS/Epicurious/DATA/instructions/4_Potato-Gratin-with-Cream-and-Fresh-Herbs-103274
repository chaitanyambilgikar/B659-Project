Preheat oven to 400°F. Butter 8x8x2-inch glass baking dish with 1 tablespoon butter. Place potatoes, cream, milk, chives, thyme, salt, pepper and remaining 2 tablespoons butter in large pot. Cover and bring mixture to boil over medium-high heat.
Transfer potato mixture to prepared dish, overlapping top layer of potatoes in pattern, if desired. Cover dish with foil. Bake 40 minutes. Uncover and continue to bake until potatoes are tender, sauce bubbles thickly and top is brown, about 15 minutes. Let potatoes stand 10 minutes before serving.

Cut a small shallow X in stem end of each tomato and have ready a bowl of ice and cold water. In a saucepan of boiling water blanch tomatoes, 3 at a time, 2 to 3 seconds and immediately transfer with a slotted spoon to ice water to stop cooking. (Tomatoes should still be firm, but skins should slip off easily.)
In a bowl stir together vodka, vinegar, and sugar until sugar is dissolved. Peel tomatoes and add to vodka mixture with dill, pepper, and salt to taste, tossing gently. Marinate tomatoes, covered and chilled, at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour.
With a citrus zester cut 2 tablespoons zest in strips from lemon. (Alternatively, cut a 3- by 1-inch piece zest from lemon with a vegetable peeler and cut crosswise into thin strips.)
Just before serving, gently toss tomatoes with a rubber spatula and sprinkle with zest. Serve tomatoes with small forks or wooden picks.

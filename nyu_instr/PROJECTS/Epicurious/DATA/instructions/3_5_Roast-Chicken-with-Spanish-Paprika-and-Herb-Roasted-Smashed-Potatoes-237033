Tuck wing tips behind shoulder. Transfer to large rimmed baking sheet. Using fingertips, separate skin from chicken over breasts and thighs. Insert 1 thyme sprig between skin and flesh over each breast and each thigh. Repeat with second chicken. Mix 2 tablespoons coarse kosher salt and 2 teaspoons paprika in small bowl. Sprinkle all over chickens.

Mix 6 tablespoons oil, fennel seeds and crushed red pepper in small bowl. Thread shrimp onto skewers. Place on rimmed baking sheet. Pour oil mixture over; turn to coat. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate 30 minutes.
Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Brush fennel wedges with 2 tablespoons oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill fennel until golden, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to large bowl. Grill shrimp until opaque in center, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer shrimp to plate; tent with foil.
Add spinach and tomatoes to fennel. Toss with enough vinaigrette to coat. Divide salad among plates. Sprinkle with bacon reserved from vinaigrette. Remove shrimp from skewers and arrange around salad. Garnish with chopped fennel fronds.

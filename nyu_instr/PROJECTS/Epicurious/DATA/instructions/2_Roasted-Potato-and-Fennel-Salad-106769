Preheat the oven to 400°F. Prick the potatoes and place on a baking sheet. Bake until crisp and tender, about 1 hour. When cool enough to handle, quarter the potatoes and place in a bowl with the diced fennel, scallions and 1/3 cup of the fennel ferns. Combine the mayonnaise and sour cream, then fold into the potato salad. Season well with salt and pepper. Garnish with the remaining tablespoon of fennel ferns.

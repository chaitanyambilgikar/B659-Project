Cut scallion greens into 1-inch lengths, reserving white parts for another use.
Pat shellfish dry and season with salt and pepper.
Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then stir-fry eggplant with salt and pepper until golden brown on both sides and cooked through (add 1 1/2 tablespoons more oil if eggplant is sticking to skillet). Transfer eggplant to a plate as cooked and keep warm, covered.
Add 2 tablespoons oil to skillet and sear shrimp and scallops in batches, without crowding, until just cooked through, about 4 minutes. Transfer to plate and keep warm, covered.
Add water, soy sauce, sugar, and chile paste to skillet and simmer, stirring, until reduced by half. Stir in lime juice.
Serve shellfish and eggplant with sauce, scallion greens, cilantro, and basil.

For pork: Combine first 10 ingredients in blender. Blend until spices are finely ground, about 2 minutes. Place pork in large glass baking dish. Pour marinade over pork; turn to coat. Arrange bone side up, tent loosely with foil and refrigerate at least 12 hours or overnight.
For sauce: Preheat oven to 350°F. Scrape marinade from pork. Pat pork dry with paper towels. Sprinkle pork generously with 1/2 teaspoon cardamom, salt and pepper. Heat oil in large roasting pan set over 2 burners on medium heat. Add pork and cook until brown, turning occasionally, about 4 minutes.
Add wine, prunes, prune juice, brandy, cinnamon sticks and bay leaves to pan. Transfer to oven. Roast uncovered until meat thermometer inserted into thickest part of pork registers 160°F, basting often with pan juices, about 1 hour 30 minutes. Transfer pork and prunes to platter. Tent with foil. Strain pan juices into large glass measuring cup. Spoon 4 tablespoons fat off top of pan juices. Pour pan juices into heavy small saucepan. Add jelly and remaining 1/2 teaspoon cardamom. Simmer until jelly melts and sauce lightly coats spoon, about 8 minutes. Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.
Serve pork with sauce.

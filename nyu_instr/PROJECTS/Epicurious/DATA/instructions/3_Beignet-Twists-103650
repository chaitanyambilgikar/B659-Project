Combine first 8 ingredients in medium bowl; add 1 tablespoon oil and whisk to blend. Add flour 1/2 cup at a time, mixing until very thick dough forms; scrape out onto lightly floured surface. Knead until no longer sticky, about 3 minutes. Roll out dough to 10x12-inch rectangle. Cut lengthwise into 3 strips, then crosswise into 3/4-inch-wide strips.
Pour oil into large saucepan to depth of 1 inch. Heat oil to 350°F. Working in batches, twist each strip of dough several times and drop into oil. Fry until golden, turning occasionally, about 2 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer beignets to paper towels and drain. Sift powdered sugar over. Serve warm or at room temperature. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.)

In second large mixing bowl, stir together sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Measure out 1/4 cup of mixture into small bowl and set aside.
In third large mixing bowl, whisk together eggs, cream, milk, and vanilla. Whisk egg mixture into larger bowl of sugar mixture, then pour over bread-chocolate mixture and stir to combine.

Preheat oven to 400°F with rack in middle. Butter muffin pan if not nonstick.
Soak raisins in hot water 5 minutes, then drain.
Meanwhile, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, spices, and salt in a large bowl.
In a separate bowl, whisk together butter, brown sugar, pumpkin, buttermilk, eggs, and vanilla. Add to dry ingredients and stir until just combined, then stir in raisins and 2 tablespoons pumpkin seeds.
Divide batter among muffin cups and sprinkle with remaining seeds. Bake until a wooden pick comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Cool slightly on a rack.

Working in batches, cook spinach in large pot of boiling salted water until just wilted and bright green, about 1 minute. Drain. Cool spinach in bowl of ice water. Drain. Squeeze spinach to remove excess liquid. Transfer spinach to large bowl. Fluff with fork.
Place 4 layers of cheesecloth or 1 linen towel on work surface. Spoon tofu into center of cheesecloth. Bring corners of cheesecloth together over tofu. Gently squeeze cheesecloth to remove excess liquid from tofu. Transfer tofu to paper coffee filter or double layer of paper towels. Allow filter to absorb liquid from tofu. Repeat with 4 more coffee filters or double layers of paper towels to remove most of excess liquid from tofu (tofu will be slightly crumbly).
Transfer drained tofu to medium bowl. Stir in miso and next 5 ingredients (mixture will look curdled). (Can be prepared 8 hours ahead. Cover spinach and tofu dressing separately and refrigerate.) Spoon tofu dressing over spinach and toss to coat. Season to taste with salt. Divide spinach among bowls. Sprinkle sesame seeds over; garnish with lemon.

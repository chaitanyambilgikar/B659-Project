In a small bowl whisk together the vinegar and salt and pepper to taste, add the oil in a stream, whisking, and whisk the vinaigrette until it is emulsified. In a bowl toss the herbs with enough of the vinaigrette to just coat them until the salad is combined well, divide the salad among 8 chilled salad plates, and garnish it with the flowers.

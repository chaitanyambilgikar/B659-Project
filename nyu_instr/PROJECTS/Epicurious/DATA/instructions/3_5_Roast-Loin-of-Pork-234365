Preheat the oven to 350°F. Heat the butter, oil and rosemary in an oval roasting pan, add the pork and cook, turning frequently, for 5-10 minutes until browned all over. Add the wine and cook until it has evaporated, then season with salt and pepper. Transfer to the oven and roast, turning occasionally, and basting with hot milk, for 1 hour or until cooked through. Remove the pork from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes, then carve, serve with a side dish of boiled Tuscan or cannellini beans seasoned with extra-virgin olive oil, salt and pepper.

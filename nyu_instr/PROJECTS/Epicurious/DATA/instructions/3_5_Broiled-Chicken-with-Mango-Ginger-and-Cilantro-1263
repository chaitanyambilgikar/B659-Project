Preheat broiler. Lightly oil broiler pan. Using mallet or rolling pin, pound chicken lightly between sheets of waxed paper to even 1/2-inch thickness. Season chicken with salt and pepper. Place chicken, skin side up, on prepared pan. Broil until skin is golden brown, about 4 minutes. Turn chicken over and broil until cooked through but still juicy, about 3 minutes longer.
Meanwhile, heat 2 teaspoons oil in heavy small skillet over medium heat. Add ginger and garlic; sauté 2 minutes. Add mango; sauté until heated through and beginning to soften, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat. Mix in cilantro and vinegar. Season with salt and pepper.
Place chicken on plates. Top with warm mango mixture and serve.

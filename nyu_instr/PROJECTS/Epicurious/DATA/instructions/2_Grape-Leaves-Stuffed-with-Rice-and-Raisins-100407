Preheat oven to 375°F. Lightly oil 11 x 7-inch glass baking dish. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onions and saute until golden brown, about 8 minutes. Mix in raisins, ground coffee, oregano, pepper and cumin. Add rice and 1 cup water; stir to blend. Reduce heat, cover and simmer until rice is partially cooked and no liquid remains, stirring occasionally, about 12 minutes. Season to taste with salt. Cool to lukewarm.
Place 1 grape leaf, vein side up, on work surface. Spoon 2 tablespoons rice mixture in center of leaf at widest part. Fold bottom of leaf over. Fold sides in. Roll up. Place seam side down in prepared dish. Repeat with remaining leaves and rice mixture, arranging in single layer in dish. Pour 1 cup water over rolled grape leaves. Cover with foil; bake until rice is tender, about 40 minutes. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cool slightly. Cover; refrigerate.) Serve warm or cold with yogurt and lemon wedges.

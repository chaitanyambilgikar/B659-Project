Make the dressing: In a small bowl whisk together the lemon juice, the vinegar, the mustard, and salt and pepper to taste, add the oil in a stream, whisking, and whisk the dressing until it is emulsified.
In a bowl toss together the radicchio, the fennel, the walnuts, the Roquefort, and the dressing. On each of 8 plates arrange some of the arugula and divide the radicchio mixture among the plates.

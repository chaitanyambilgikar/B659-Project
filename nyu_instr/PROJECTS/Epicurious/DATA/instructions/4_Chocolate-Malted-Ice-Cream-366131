Combine the cream, 1/2 cup milk, malted milk powder, sugar, cocoa powder, corn syrup, and salt in a saucepan. Whisk well to dissolve the malt powder and cocoa.
Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the mixture begins to steam; watch it carefully and make sure it does not come to a boil.
While the mixture heats, combine the remaining milk, milk powder, cornstarch, and vanilla extract in a small bowl, and stir until smooth and both of the powders have dissolved.
Add the cornstarch mixture to the pan, and bring to a boil over low heat, stirring constantly. Whisk the mixture until smooth and simmer over very low heat, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes, or until thickened. If the mixture is lumpy, strain it through a sieve.
Transfer the hot liquid to a storage container, and press a sheet of plastic wrap directly onto the surface of the mixture to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate the mixture uncovered until it is completely chilled (below 40°F).
Freeze the mixture in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfer the soft ice cream to a chilled mixing bowl and fold in the chopped malted milk balls.
Serve immediately for a soft ice cream, or transfer the mixture to an airtight storage container and freeze until hard. Allow the ice cream to sit at room temperature for 15 minutes before serving if frozen solid.

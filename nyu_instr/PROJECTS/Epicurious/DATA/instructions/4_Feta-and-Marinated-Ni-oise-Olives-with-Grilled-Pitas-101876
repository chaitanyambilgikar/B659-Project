Make marinated olives: With a vegetable peeler remove 4 wide strips zest from lemon. Thinly slice garlic. Break rosemary and thyme into 1-inch pieces and halve bay leaves. In a small airtight container stir together all marinated-olive ingredients. Marinate olives, covered and chilled, at least 2 hours and up to 1 month.
Prepare grill.
Put feta on a platter and pour olives and marinade over it. Lightly brush pitas with oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill pitas on a rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals about 1 minute on each side. (Alternatively, grill pitas in a hot well-seasoned ridged grill pan over moderately high heat.)
Serve pitas warm with feta and olives. Serve cucumber spears on the side.

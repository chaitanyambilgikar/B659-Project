Put a baking sheet in middle of oven and preheat oven to 375°F.
If dough is in 1 piece, cut in half. Roll out each piece into a 12-inch square on a lightly floured surface. Line a 9-inch square baking pan with 1 piece of dough, draping it slightly over sides.
Stir together onions, oil, and 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and pepper and spread in an even layer over dough. Top with prosciutto. Peel potato and thinly slice (about 1/8 inch thick), then arrange in one layer over prosciutto, overlapping slightly. Crack eggs on top of potatoes, gently arranging yolks so they don't touch one another. Season eggs with 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and pepper.
Cut several slits in remaining pastry square and lay over top of pie, then crimp edge and trim.
Bake until pastry is golden brown and puffed, 50 to 60 minutes.

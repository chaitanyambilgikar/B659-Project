1. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or in a food processor, beat the butter and brown sugar until smooth. Then add one of the eggs and mix to combine. Add the flour, cinnamon, and salt, and beat or pulse to form a dough. Roll the dough to form one or two long cylinders about 2 inches in diameter, wrap them in plastic, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or as long as 3 days.
2. Preheat the oven to 325°F. Line several baking sheets with parchment paper or nonstick liners.
3. Beat the remaining egg in a bowl. Pour about 1/4 inch of granulated sugar into a shallow dish. Brush the outside of the dough log with the beaten egg, then roll the log in the sugar to coat it. Slice 1/4-inch coins of cookie dough from the log, and arrange them on the prepared baking sheets.
4. Bake until lightly browned around the edges and firm, about 15 minutes. Let cool on the baking sheets. These cookies will keep for 1 week, stored airtight at room temperature.

Heat olive oil in heavy large skillet over high heat. Add mushrooms and sauté until brown but not juicy, about 6 minutes. Add garlic and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add Madeira and cook until evaporated, about 1 minute. Mix in whipping cream and sliced basil; stir until sauce coats mushrooms, about 1 minute. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve.

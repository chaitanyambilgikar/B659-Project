In a small saucepan whisk together the soy sauce, the Scotch, the gingerroot, the sugar, 1/2 teaspoon of the cornstarch, the aniseed, the cinnamon, and the water, bring the mixture to a boil, whisking, and simmer it, covered, for 5 minutes.
While the sauce is simmering, pat the fillets dry between paper towels and rub both sides with the remaining 2 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch, shaking off the excess. In a large non-stick skillet heat the oil over moderately high heat until it just begins to smoke, add the fillets, skin sides down, and sear them, pressing them with a metal spatula to flatten them, for 4 minutes. Turn the fillets, strain the soy sauce mixture through a fine sieve into the skillet, and simmer the mixture for 3 minutes, or until the fish just flakes. Transfer the fillets, skin sides up, with a slotted spatula to plates and simmer the sauce, stirring, for 1 minute, or until it is thickened slightly. Spoon the sauce around the fillets and sprinkle the fillets with the scallion.

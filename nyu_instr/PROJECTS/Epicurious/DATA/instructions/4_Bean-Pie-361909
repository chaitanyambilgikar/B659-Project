Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 9-inch pie pan with crust, then crimp the edges decoratively.
In a medium bowl, combine the sugar, flour, cinnamon, and nutmeg, and stir with a fork to mix well. Add the milk, butter, eggs, and vanilla, and stir to mix everything well. Add the mashed beans and use an electric mixer or a whisk to beat all the ingredients together well, making a thick, smooth filling.
Pour the filling into the piecrust. Place the pie on the bottom shelf of the oven. Bake until the edges puff up and the center is fairly firm, wiggling only a little when you gently nudge the pan, 40 to 50 minutes.
Place the pie on a cooling rack or a folded kitchen towel and let cool for 20 to 30 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.

Preheat oven to 350°F. Blend first 6 ingredients in processor until smooth. Pour mixture into crust. Bake until cake filling is just set, about 35 minutes. Cool cheesecake slightly.
Combine 1 cup sour cream, 2 tablespoons sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla in small bowl. Spread mixture evenly over cheesecake. Bake 10 minutes. Cool. Refrigerate cake overnight. (Can be prepared 2 days ahead.) Cut into wedges and serve.

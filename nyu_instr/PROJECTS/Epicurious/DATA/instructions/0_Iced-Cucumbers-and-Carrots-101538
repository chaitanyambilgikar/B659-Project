Cut the carrots lengthwise into 1/4-inch slices using the corrugated blade on a mandoline or with a very sharp knife and in a large bowl of ice and cold water let them soak for 1 to 2 hours, or until they are curled. Halve the cucumbers crosswise cut them lengthwise into eighths, and chill them in another large bowl of ice and cold water for 15 minutes. Drain the vegetables, arrange them decoratively in a serving bowl filled with ice, and serve them with the sauce.

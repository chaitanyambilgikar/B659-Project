Prepare grill.
Peel back corn husks carefully, without breaking off, and discard silks. Fold husks back into place and tie ends together with strips of outer husk or kitchen string. In large bowls cover corn with cold water and soak 10 minutes. Drain corn and grill on a rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals, turning occasionally, 15 minutes.

Mince garlic with anchovies. If veal is encased in a net, remove net and with kitchen string tie veal crosswise at 1-inch intervals.
Pat veal dry. In a heavy kettle just large enough to hold veal heat oil over moderate heat until hot but not smoking and brown veal well, turning it. Transfer veal to a plate. In oil remaining in kettle cook anchovy mixture, stirring, 1 minute. Add wine and boil 1 minute.
Return veal to kettle and simmer, partly covered, turning veal every 20 minutes and adding water as needed (about 3 tablespoons at a time; do not let liquid completely evaporate‑there should always be just enough to keep veal from sticking to kettle), 1 1/2 to 2 hours, or until an instant-read thermometer inserted in thickest part registers 155° F. for medium.
Transfer veal to a cutting board and let stand 10 minutes. Skim any fat from liquid in kettle. Add 1/3 cup water and simmer, scraping up brown bits from bottom and side of kettle, until liquid has consistency of thin gravy.
Transfer pan juices to a platter. Cut veal crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick slices and discard string. Arrange slices over pan juices and spoon salsa verde over meat.

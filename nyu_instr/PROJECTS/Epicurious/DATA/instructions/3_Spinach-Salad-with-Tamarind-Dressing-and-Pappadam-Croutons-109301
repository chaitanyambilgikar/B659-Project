Fry pappadams: Heat 1/2 inch oil in a 10-inch heavy skillet (2 inches deep) over moderate heat until thermometer registers 350°F (see cooks' note, below). Fry 1 pappadam, turning over once, until blistered and pale golden, about 1 minute total. Lift pappadam from skillet with tongs, letting excess oil drip back into skillet, and transfer to paper towels to drain (pappadam will crisp as it cools). Return oil to 350°F and fry remaining pappadams, 1 at a time, in same manner.
Make dressing: Whisk together water, lime juice, honey, tamarind concentrate, and salt in a small bowl, then add oil in a slow stream, whisking until combined.
Assemble salad: Toss spinach and cucumbers with dressing in a large bowl. Break pappadams into 1 1/2-inch pieces and add to salad just before serving, tossing gently to combine.

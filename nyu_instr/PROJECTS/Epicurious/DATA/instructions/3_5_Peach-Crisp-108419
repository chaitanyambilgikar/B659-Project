Preheat oven to 375°F.
Stir together sugar, flour, granola, spices, and salt in a bowl, then work in butter with a pastry blender or your fingertips until mixture forms small clumps.
Spread peaches in a lightly buttered 13- by 9-inch (2 1/2- to 3-quart) baking dish. Toss peaches with juice and top with crumb mixture.
Bake in middle of oven until topping is golden and peaches are tender, 35 to 40 minutes. Cool slightly and serve warm.

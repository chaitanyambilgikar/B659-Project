Boil or steam the shrimp until just cooked through, about 2 minutes. Set aside.
Slice the two zucchinis in 1/2-inch-thick rounds and boil in water until tender, about 3 minutes. Drain the water, return the zucchini to the pan, and add the can of stewed tomatoes to the zucchini. Return to heat and simmer briefly until heated through.
Arrange rice on a plate. Cover with shrimp. Top off with the stewed-tomato-and-zucchini mixture. Garnish with grated cheese.

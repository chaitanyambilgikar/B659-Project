Make turkey cutlets: Pat turkey dry and spread seasoned flour on a plate. In a small shallow bowl beat eggs lightly and in another small shallow bowl stir together bread crumbs and Parmesan.
Dredge cutlets in flour, shaking off excess, and dip in egg, letting excess drip off. Coat cutlets with bread crumb mixture and put on a wax-paper-lined tray.Chill cutlets 15 minutes.
In a 12-inch non-stick skillet heat oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and sauté cutlets 1 1/2 to 2 minutes on each side, or until golden and just cooked through. Remove skillet from heat.
Make salad: In a bowl combine watercress and onion and drizzle with oil, tossing to coat. Add lemon juice and salt and toss well.
Transfer cutlets with a slotted spatula to paper towels to drain briefly and arrange on plates. Top cutlets with salad and serve with lemon wedges.

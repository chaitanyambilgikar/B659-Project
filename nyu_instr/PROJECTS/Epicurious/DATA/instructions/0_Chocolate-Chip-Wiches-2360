For cookies: Preheat oven to 350°F. Combine first 6 ingredients in processor and blend. Add butter and vanilla. Process until mixture resembles fine meal and begins to stick together, using on/off turns. Add walnuts and process until finely chopped. Mix in chocolate.
Transfer mixture to sheet of waxed paper. Press together. Top with another sheet of waxed paper. Roll out 1/4 inch thick. Cut out cookies using 2 1/2-inch round cookie cutter. Transfer to ungreased cookie sheet. Gather scraps, reroll and cut additional cookies. Sprinkle cookies with sugar. Bake until just beginning to color, about 22 minutes. Cool on cookie sheet on rack 5 minutes. Carefully transfer cookies to rack and cool. (Can be prepared 3 days ahead. Store in airtight container.)

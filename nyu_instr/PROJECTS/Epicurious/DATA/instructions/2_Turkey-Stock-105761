Pat dry neck and giblets. Heat oil in a 4-quart heavy pot over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then brown neck and giblets, turning occasionally, about 5 minutes. Add vegetables and sauté, stirring, until golden, about 5 minutes. Add wine and boil 1 minute. Add remaining ingredients and cook at a strong simmer, uncovered, until reduced to about 4 cups, 30 to 45 minutes. Pour stock through a large fine sieve into a large bowl and discard solids. Skim off and discard any fat.

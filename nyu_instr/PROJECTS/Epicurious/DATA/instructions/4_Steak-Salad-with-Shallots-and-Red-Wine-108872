Stir together salt, pepper, and cumin in a small bowl. Pat steaks dry and sprinkle spice mixture evenly on both sides, rubbing to adhere.
Heat oil in a 10- to 12-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat until hot but not smoking, then cook steaks, turning over once, until thermometer inserted horizontally registers 115°F, about 12 minutes total.
Transfer steaks to a cutting board and let stand, loosely covered, 10 minutes. (Beef will continue to cook as it stands.) Add shallots to skillet and cook over moderate heat, stirring frequently, until just softened, about 3 minutes. Stir in wine, vinegar, and brown sugar and cook 3 minutes. Add butter and cook, whisking constantly, until butter is incorporated and sauce is slightly thickened. Pour any meat juices accumulated on cutting board into sauce.
Cut steaks into 1/4-inch slices and serve over escarole. Spoon shallots and sauce over steak.

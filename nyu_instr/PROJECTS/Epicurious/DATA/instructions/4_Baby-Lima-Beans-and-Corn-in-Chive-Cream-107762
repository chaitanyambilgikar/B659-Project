Cook bacon in a 10-inch nonstick skillet over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until crisp. Transfer bacon with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain, then cook onion and bell pepper in fat in skillet over moderate heat, stirring frequently, until vegetables are softened, 5 to 6 minutes.
Add lima beans, corn, water, salt, and pepper, then simmer, covered, until vegetables are tender, about 8 minutes. Increase heat to high and add cream, then boil, uncovered, until liquid is reduced by half, 7 to 10 minutes. Stir in herbs and salt to taste. Serve sprinkled with bacon.

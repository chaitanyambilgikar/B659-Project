Pierce potatoes with fork. Microwave on high until tender, turning once, about 10 minutes. Cut in half. Scoop out enough potato to measure 1 1/4 cups; cool.
Process 1 1/4 cups potato and matzo meal, eggs, 2 1/2 tablespoons margarine, sugar, salt and ginger until blended. transfer mixture to bowl. Cover and chill until firm, about 4 hours or overnight.
Drop matzo mixture by generous teaspoonfuls onto sheet of foil. Using wet hands, roll dropped mixture into balls.
Cook 1/3 of matzo balls in large pot of boiling salted water until tender, about 6 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer to clean sheet of foil. Repeat with remaining matzo balls in 2 batches. Let stand until firm, at least 30 minutes.
Melt 5 1/2 tablespoons margarine in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add half of matzo balls; sauté until beginning to brown, about 4 minutes. Transfer to 13x9x2-inch glass baking dish. Repeat with remaining matzo balls.
Bring juice and apricots to boil in small saucepan. Remove from heat. Cover; steep until apricots are tender, about 10 minutes. Drain juice into medium saucepan; add cinnamon. Add 4 tablespoons margarine and jam. Simmer over medium heat until reduced to 3/4 cup, about 15 minutes. Return apricots to sauce. (Matzo balls and sauce can be made 2 hours ahead. Cover loosely; let stand at room temperature.)
Preheat oven to 350°F. Spoon sauce over matzo balls. Bake until heated through, about 20 minutes. Top with mint.

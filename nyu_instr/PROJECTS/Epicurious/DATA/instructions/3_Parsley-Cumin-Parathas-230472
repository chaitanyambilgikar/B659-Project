Grind cumin seeds with salt to a powder in grinder. Transfer to a large bowl and stir in flours, parsley, water, and oil and continue to stir until a dough forms.
Turn out dough onto a work surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Several times during kneading, pick up dough and slap it against the work surface 8 to 10 times to relax dough. Cover dough with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature 1 hour.
Lightly oil griddle, then heat over moderately low heat until hot, 10 to 15 minutes.
While griddle is heating, divide dough into 4 portions, then roll out 1 portion on a lightly floured surface into an 11-inch round. Lightly brush round with some ghee and cut into quarters, then, starting with rounded edge nearest you, fold each quarter in thirds to form a slimmer triangle (bottom edge will still be rounded). Repeat with remaining dough to form a total of 16 slim triangles.
Roll out 1 triangle on a lightly floured surface first to widen it, then to lengthen it into a 9- by- 4-inch triangle, sprinkling with flour as necessary to prevent sticking. Transfer to a baking sheet and cover with a sheet of wax paper, then roll out and cover remaining triangles in same manner, layering them between sheets of wax paper.
Cook parathas , 3 or 4 at a time, on griddle until undersides are browned in spots, 2 to 3 minutes (parathas will puff, then deflate). Turn parathas over and lightly brush with ghee, then cook until other side of each is golden brown in spots, 1 to 2 minutes. Turn over and brush once more, then cook until parathas are cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes.
Transfer each batch of parathas to a sheet of foil as browned and wrap loosely to keep warm while cooking remaining parathas.

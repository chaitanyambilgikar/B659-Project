For brittle: Spray large rimmed baking sheet with nonstick spray. Stir sugar, 2 tablespoons water, and pinch of salt in small saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat to high. Boil without stirring until mixture turns deep amber, occasionally swirling pan and brushing down sides with wet pastry brush, about 5 minutes. Stir in seeds; immediately spread out on baking sheet. Cool until hardened. Break into pieces. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Store in airtight container at room temperature.)
For tartes: Bring 8 cups water, 1 tablespoon vanilla, and 1 teaspoon salt to boil in heavy large saucepan. Add yam slices; cook until just tender, about 6 minutes (do not overcook). Using slotted spoon, transfer yam slices to rack; cool.
Preheat oven to 375°F. Lightly spray eight 3/4-cup ramekins or custard cups with nonstick spray. Stir 1 cup sugar and 3 tablespoons water in heavy small saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Increase temperature to high. Boil without stirring until syrup turns deep amber, occasionally swirling pan and brushing down sides with wet pastry brush, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Gradually add butter, whisking until melted and smooth (mixture will bubble). Whisk in 1 teaspoon vanilla. Divide caramel among ramekins. Place 1 yam slice atop caramel in each ramekin.
Using 3 1/2-inch round cookie cutter, cut pastry into 8 disks. Pierce pastry all over with fork. Top each yam slice with pastry disk. Beat egg in bowl to blend. Brush pastry lightly with egg. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon sugar. Bake until pastry is browned and puffed, about 25 minutes.
Invert tartes onto plates. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream and brittle.

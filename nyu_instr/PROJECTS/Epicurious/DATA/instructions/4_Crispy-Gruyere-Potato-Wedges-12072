Peel potato and grate coarse. Press potato between several thickness of paper towel to remove any excess moisture.
In an 8-inch non-stick skillet heat oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and add half grated potato, spreading and tamping down with a spatula. Reduce heat to moderate and sprinkle Gruyère over potato. Spread remaining potato on top, tamping down with a spatula, and cook until golden brown and crisp, about 10 minutes on each side. Season potato with salt and pepper and cut into 6 wedges.

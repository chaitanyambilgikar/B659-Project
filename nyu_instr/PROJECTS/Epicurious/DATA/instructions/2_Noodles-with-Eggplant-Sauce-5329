Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add eggplant, onions and garlic and sauté until brown, about 12 minutes. Add sausage, crushed tomatoes, wine, bay leaves and lemon peel. Cover pot, reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until flavors blend and eggplant is very tender, about 25 minutes. Uncover and simmer until sauce thickens, about 6 minutes. Add noodles to sauce; toss to coat. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to bowl and serve.

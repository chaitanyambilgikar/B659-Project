Follow directions for making and rolling Fresh Egg Pasta dough into sheets. Starting 1 inch from 1 short side of 1 pasta sheet, drop ricotta filling by rounded teaspoonfuls down center of sheet, spacing mounds 2 inches apart. Brush pasta edges and between mounds of filling lightly with water. Cover with second pasta sheet, pressing down around filling to eliminate air pockets and to seal. Using fluted pastry wheel, cut pasta between filling, trimming sides to form 2- to 2 1/4-inch ravioli. Repeat with more pasta and remaining filling, making about 36. (Reserve remaining pasta for another use, cutting into shapes and drying on floured work surface.) Place ravioli on floured baking sheet; let dry 30 minutes. (Can be made 6 hours ahead. Cover; chill.)

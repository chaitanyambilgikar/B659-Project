Line each mold with a piece of the cheesecloth (this is not essential but it gives the dessert a neat patterned finish). In a large bowl, whisk the cheese and cream until smooth, adding a little more cream if necessary so the cheese falls easily from the spoon. In a separate bowl, whisk the egg whites until stiff. Gradually fold them into the cheese and cream.
Spoon the mixture into the mold or molds, set on a tray and cover. Leave to drain in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours and up to 36 hours.
An hour or two before serving, hull the strawberries, reserving 6-8 for decoration, or pick over the raspberries. Turn each mold on to a serving plate.
Decorate with whole, unhulled strawberries or raspberries. Chill until serving. Sprinkle the remaining prepared berries with 1-2 teaspoons sugar and leave to macerate until serving.

In the high-speed blender, combine the coconut oil, agave syrup, and lavender flowers. Process for 30 to 60 seconds, checking that the mixture is not getting too hot, until smooth. Add the cacao and almond butter and blend slowly on low speed until well mixed.
Transfer to a mixing bowl, add the chopped almonds and raisins, and mix well.
Spread the mixture onto a sheet tray lined with parchment paper in a 1‚ÅÑ2 to 1- inch layer. Top with the sliced almonds. Place in the freezer to chill until solid, about 15 minutes. Break into pieces and serve.
Will keep for a month or more in the freezer.

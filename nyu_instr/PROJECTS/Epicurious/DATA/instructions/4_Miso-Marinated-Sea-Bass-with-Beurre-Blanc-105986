Whisk mirin, white miso, sake, and sugar in 13x9x2-inch glass baking dish to combine. Add sea bass; turn to coat. Cover fish and refrigerate 2 hours.
Boil white wine, chopped shallots, chopped garlic, bay leaf, and black peppercorns in heavy large saucepan until reduced to 3/4 cup, about 7 minutes. Add whipping cream and boil until reduced to 1 cup, about 6 minutes. Strain into medium saucepan, pressing on solids. Place over low heat. Add unsalted butter 1 tablespoon at a time, whisking until melted before adding more. Remove from heat. Whisk in fresh lemon juice. Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper. Cover to keep warm.
Preheat oven to 450°F. Oil rimmed baking sheet. Remove fish from marinade; transfer to prepared sheet. Bake until almost opaque in center, about 10 minutes. Preheat broiler. Broil fish until well-browned on top and opaque in center, watching closely to avoid burning, about 3 minutes. Transfer fish to plates. Spoon sauce around and serve.
* Mirin and miso are available at Japanese markets and in the Asian foods section of some supermarkets.

On a comal or in a cast-iron skillet over moderately high heat, dry-roast the tomatoes, jalapeños, and garlic. When the garlic's papery outer skin starts to brown, remove the garlic from the pan and carefully peel it, discarding the skin. Continue roasting the tomatoes and jalapeños until soft and blackened on all sides. Transfer to a plate to cool. Peel the jalapeños and remove the stems. (Jalapeños can be spicy and leave their heat on your hands, so wear gloves or use caution when handling.) Peel and core the tomatoes.
Place the jalapeños and garlic in a molcajete, blender, or food processor and season with the salt. Grind with the pestle or process until a paste forms. Add the tomatoes, one at a time, and grind or process until smooth. Season generously with salt.

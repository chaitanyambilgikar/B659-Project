Cut bread slices into about thirty 1-inch cubes. Cut salmon lengthwise into 1/2-inch-wide strips and crosswise into 4-inch-long pieces. In a large non-stick skillet heat 3 tablespoons butter over moderate heat until foam subsides and brown half of cubes on 2 opposite sides until golden, about 2 minutes, transferring to a platter. Brown remaining cubes in same manner.
Top each cube decoratively with salmon, caviar, and crème fraîche or sour cream.

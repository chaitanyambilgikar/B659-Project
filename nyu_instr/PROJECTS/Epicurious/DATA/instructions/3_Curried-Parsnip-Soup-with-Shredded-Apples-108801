Melt butter with olive oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add onion and sauté until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add curry powder; stir 30 seconds. Add broth and parsnips. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer uncovered until parsnips are soft, about 30 minutes. Remove from heat; cool 15 minutes. Working in batches, puree soup in blender until smooth. Return to pot. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.)
Using vegetable peeler, remove apple peel in long strips; reserve. Quarter, core, and coarsely shred apples. Stir apples and yogurt into soup.
Heat corn oil in medium skillet over medium-high heat. Slice reserved apple peel lengthwise into very thin strips. Fry peel in oil until golden and crisp, about 30 seconds. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Sprinkle peel with salt.
Warm soup over medium heat, stirring occasionally (do not boil). Season with salt. Divide soup among 6 bowls. Garnish with fried apple peel.

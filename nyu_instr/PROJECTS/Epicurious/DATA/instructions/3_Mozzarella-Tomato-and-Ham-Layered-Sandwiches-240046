Place one slice of thin-sliced olive, rosemary, or white bread on a clean surface and drizzle with a little olive oil. Top with 2 thin slices mozzarella (from a 5-ounce ball), and top with a layer of fresh basil leaves. Drizzle with a little more oil. Top with another slice of bread, then with 2 thin slices of tomato, then a layer of prosciutto or salami. Drizzle with some more olive oil and top with a third slice of bread. Using a serrated knife, remove the crusts and slice into rectangles, about 1 1/2 inches wide by 3 inches long. Repeat with another 9 slices of bread.

Place half the cheese, the chopped onion, salt, pepper, vinegar, lemon juice, hot sauce, and Worcestershire in the workbowl of a food processor. Purée until well blended and liquified. Slowly drizzle the olive oil into the mixture, then turn off the machine. Crumble the remaining cheese, and pulse until well blended. There should be lots of small cheese chunks remaining in the dressing. Adjust seasoning. Refrigerate for up to two weeks.

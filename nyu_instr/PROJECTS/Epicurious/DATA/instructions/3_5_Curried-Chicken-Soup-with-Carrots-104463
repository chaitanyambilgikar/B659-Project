Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium heat. Add onions and carrots. Cover; cook until onions are tender but not brown, stirring occasionally, about 12 minutes. Mix in spices; stir 2 minutes. Transfer 1 1/2 cups onion-carrot mixture to blender. Add 2 cups broth and flour; blend until smooth.
Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper. Add to pot and stir over medium heat 5 minutes. Add puree from blender and remaining 2 cups broth. Bring soup to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until chicken is tender and soup thickens, stirring occasionally, about 25 minutes. Mix in cilantro; season soup to taste with salt and pepper.

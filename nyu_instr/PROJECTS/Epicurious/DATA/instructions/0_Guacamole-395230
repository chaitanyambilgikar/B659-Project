Season the tomatoes with salt and place in a large strainer or colander to drain. Let drain for 2 hours or overnight.
In a bowl, combine the tomatoes, onion, garlic, and all the chiles. This is best done a couple of hours ahead of time, so the flavors of the chiles meld with one another and the tomatoes.
Shortly before serving, halve, pit, and peel the avocados and then chop them medium-coarse. Add the avocados and cilantro to the tomato mixture, season with salt, and stir to mix.

Stem shiitake mushrooms. Cut all mushrooms lengthwise into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Heat olive oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add rosemary and stir 10 seconds, then add mushrooms. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Sauté until mushrooms begin to brown, about 10 minutes. Add shallots and thyme; stir 2 minutes. Add Marsala and boil until evaporated, about 30 seconds. Remove from heat. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 1 hour ahead. Let stand at room temperature.)
Preheat broiler. Place bread slices on baking sheet; broil until lightly toasted, about 2 minutes per side. Divide cheese among bread slices, covering completely. Broil until cheese melts, about 2 minutes. Rewarm mushrooms over medium heat if necessary. Mix in parsley. Place toasts on plates. Spoon mushrooms over and serve.

Wash rice in small amount of cold water, rubbing the grains between the palms. Rinse with cold water until water is clear. Drain. Put rice in 1 1/2 quart sauce pan. Add cold water. Bring to a boil. Lower heat until pan can be covered without boiling over. Cook covered 15 to 20 minutes, until water is all absorbed. Fluff rice with chopsticks or fork. Cover and allow to stand in a warm spot until serving.

Melt butter in heavy large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add choped apples and onion sauté until tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in cabbage and cook until slightly wilted, stirring frequently, about 8 minutes. Stir in sugar, cider vinegar, salt, cloves and allspice. Cover and cook until cabbage is crisp-tender, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. Uncover, add dry red wine and jelly and cook 5 minutes longer. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve warm, room temperature or chilled. (Cabbage can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Reheat over low heat if serving warm.)

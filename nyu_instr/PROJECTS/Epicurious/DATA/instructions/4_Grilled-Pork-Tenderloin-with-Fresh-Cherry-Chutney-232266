Prepare barbecue (medium heat). Mix preserves, vinegar, and allspice in medium bowl. Set aside 1/4 cup of preserves mixture for glaze; reserve remaining preserves mixture.
Heat oil in large skillet over high heat. Add onion; sauté 1 minute. Add cherries, cayenne, and reserved preserves mixture. Boil chutney until thick, stirring often, about 8 minutes. Season with salt. Set chutney aside.
Sprinkle pork with salt and pepper; brush with some glaze. Cook over hottest part of grill until brown. Move to coolest part and grill until thermometer inserted into thickest part of pork registers 145°F, turning often and brushing with glaze, about 25 minutes total. Transfer pork to platter. Let rest 10 minutes. Rewarm reserved chutney; serve with pork.

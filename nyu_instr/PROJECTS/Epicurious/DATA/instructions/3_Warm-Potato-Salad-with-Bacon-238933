Cover potatoes generously with cold salted water (1 tablespoon salt for 3 quarts water) in a pot and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes. Drain potatoes.
When potatoes are cool enough to handle but still warm, peel and cut into 1-inch pieces, then toss with vinegar and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a large bowl.
Cook bacon in oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-low heat, turning occasionally, until crisp. Drain bacon on paper towels, reserving fat in skillet.
Add 1/4 cup of hot bacon fat to potatoes and toss. Coarsely crumble bacon on top, then add chives and salt and pepper to taste and toss.

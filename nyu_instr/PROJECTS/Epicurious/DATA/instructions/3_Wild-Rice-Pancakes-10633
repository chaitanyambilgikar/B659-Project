In a heavy saucepan combine the rice, the water, and the salt and simmer the mixture, covered, for 45 to 50 minutes, or until the rice is tender and all the water is absorbed. Transfer the rice to a large bowl and let it cool. In a heavy skillet cook the carrot, the celery, the onion, the scallion green, and the thyme in the butter over moderate heat, stirring, for about 10 minutes, or until the carrot is just tender, and transfer the mixture to the bowl. In a small bowl whisk together the eggs and the milk, stir the egg mixture into the rice mixture, and stir in the flour and salt and pepper to taste.
Heat the griddle over moderately high heat until it is hot enough so that drops of water scatter over its surface and brush it with some of the oil. Working in batches, scoop the batter onto the griddle by 1/4-cup measures, flatten the pancakes slightly, and cook them for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, or until they are golden. Transfer the pancakes as they are cooked to a heatproof platter and keep them warm in a preheated 200°F. oven.

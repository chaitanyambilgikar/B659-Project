Beat together all ingredients in a large bowl with an electric mixer at medium speed until just combined, about 1 minute.
Increase speed to high and continueto beat icing, occasionally scraping down side of bowl with a rubber spatula, until it holds stiff peaks, about 3 minutes in a standing mixer or 10 with a handheld. If not using icing immediately, cover with plastic wrap and a dampened kitchen towel.

In a dry small heavy skillet toast cuminseed and coriander seeds over moderate heat, shaking skillet, until spices are fragrant, about 2 minutes. Cool spices completely and in a mortar with pestle or in an electric spice or coffee grinder grind fine.
In a bowl whisk together tahini and water until smooth and whisk in spices, vinegar, sour cream, and salt and pepper to taste. Dressing may be thinned with additional water if necessary.

Char peppers directly over gas flame or in broiler until blackened on all sides. Enclose peppers in paper bag 10 minutes. Peel and seed peppers, then cut into 1/3-inch-wide strips. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
Working in batches, cook broccoli and broccoli rabe in large pot of boiling salted water until just crisp-tender, about 3 minutes per batch. Using large slotted spoon or strainer, transfer vegetables to bowl of ice water to cool. Drain well. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Wrap in paper towels; enclose in resealable plastic bags and refrigerate.)
Heat olive oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add garlic; stir until golden, about 1 minute. Add broccoli and broccoli rabe; toss until coated with oil and heated through, about 5 minutes. Add bell pepper strips; toss to blend. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to platter. Serve warm or at room temperature.

Heat oil in large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add onions, garlic, ginger, turmeric and saffron; sauté until onions are translucent, about 5 minutes. Add chicken and cook until brown on all sides, about 10 minutes. Add 3 cups water and bring to boil. Reduce heat, cover and simmer until chicken is cooked through, about 40 minutes. Using tongs, transfer chicken to platter.
Add garbanzo beans, parsley and cilantro to Dutch oven. Boil until sauce thickens slightly, about 20 minutes. Return chicken to Dutch oven. Simmer until heated through, about 5 minutes.

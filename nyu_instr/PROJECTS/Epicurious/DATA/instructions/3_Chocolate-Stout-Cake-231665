Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350°F. Lightly brush ring pan with melted butter and chill 2 minutes, then butter again and chill while making batter.
Bring beer to a boil in a small saucepan and add prunes. Remove from heat and let stand until most of liquid is absorbed.
Meanwhile, melt chocolate and remaining stick butter together in a small heavy saucepan over low heat, stirring constantly. Sift together flour, baking soda, and salt into a bowl.
Beat together eggs, brown sugar, and vanilla in a large bowl with an electric mixer at high speed until thick, about 2 minutes. Add chocolate mixture and beat until just combined. Reduce speed to low and add flour mixture, mixing until just combined. Stir in prune mixture until combined well. Spoon batter into ring mold and bake until a wooden skewer inserted into middle of cake comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes.
Cool cake in mold on a rack 10 minutes, then invert onto rack to cool completely, at least 30 minutes.

For cake: Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter 10-inch-diameter angel food cake pan. Stir cake flour, baking powder and salt in medium bowl to blend. Beat butter, sugar, orange peel and cloves in medium bowl until light and creamy. Mix in vanilla extract. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Add egg whites and beat until well blended, about 2 minutes. Beat in dry ingredients alternately with milk in 3 additions.
Spoon batter into pan. Smooth top. Bake until tester inserted near center of cake comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Cool cake in pan on rack. Turn out onto platter. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover; let stand at room temperature.)
For glaze: Mix powdered sugar and orange juice in small bowl. Drizzle glaze over cake. Let stand until glaze sets, about 30 minutes.
Mix strawberries and 1/4 cup sugar in medium bowl. Let stand at room temperature until juices form, about 20 minutes. Cut cake into slices and place on plates. Spoon strawberry mixture and sweetened whipped cream alongside cake and serve.

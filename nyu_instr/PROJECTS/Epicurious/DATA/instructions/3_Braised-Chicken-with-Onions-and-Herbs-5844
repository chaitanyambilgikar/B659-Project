Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper. Melt butter in large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken to skillet; sauté until brown, about 3 minutes per side. Using tongs, transfer chicken to plate. Add onion, bay leaves and rosemary to skillet. Reduce heat to medium; sauté until onion is tender, about 6 minutes. Add broth and wine. Boil until mixture thickens slightly, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes. Return chicken to skillet; spoon sauce over. Cover skillet and simmer until chicken is cooked through, about 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve.

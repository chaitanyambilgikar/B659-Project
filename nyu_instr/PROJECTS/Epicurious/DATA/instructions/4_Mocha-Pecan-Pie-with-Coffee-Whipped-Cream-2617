For Crust: Combine first 4 ingredients in processor. Using on/off turns, cut in butter and shortening until mixture resembles coarse meal. Blend in orange juice and enough water by tablespoonfuls to form moist clumps. Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk. Wrap in plastic and chill 1 hour. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Keep refrigerated. Soften dough slightly at room temperature before rolling.) Preheat oven to 350° F. Roll out dough on lightly floured surface to 12-inch-diameter round. Transfer to 9-inch-diameter glass pie dish. Trim edges and crimp decoratively. Freeze 15 minutes. Line crust with foil; fill with dried beans or pie weights. Bake 15 minutes. Remove foil and beans. Bake crust until pale golden, about 10 minutes. Cool on rack.
For Filling: Melt butter in heavy small saucepan over medium heat. Stir in cocoa, then cream and espresso powder. Pour into large bowl. Add corn syrup, sugar, eggs, vanilla and salt; whisk until well blended. Stir in pecans. Pour filling into pie crust. Bake until puffed and set, about 1 hour. Transfer to rack and cool completely. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and let stand at room temperature.)
Cut pie into wedges. Transfer to plates. Serve with dollops of Coffee Whipped Cream.

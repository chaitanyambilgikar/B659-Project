Purée anchovies with vinegar in a blender. With motor running, add oil in a slow stream and blend until emulsified. Transfer to a bowl. If dressing is too thick, whisk in water 1 teaspoon at a time to thin to desired consistency. Season with salt and pepper.
Preheat oven to 450°F.
Pat steaks dry and season generously with salt and pepper. Heat an oiled ridged grill pan over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then grill steaks, in batches if necessary, until well browned on both sides, about 14 minutes total.
Transfer steaks to a shallow baking pan and roast in middle of oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted 2 inches into thickest part of meat (do not touch bone) registers 125°F, about 15 minutes. Transfer steaks to a cutting board, reserving meat juices in pan, and let stand 5 minutes.
Toss greens, parsley, and olives with enough dressing to coat and season with salt and pepper. Cut steak across grain into thin slices. Drizzle with reserved pan juices or remaining vinaigrette and serve with salad.

Pat steak dry. Heat oil in a 4-to 5-quart heavy pot over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Cook steak until browned on all sides and medium-rare, about 3 minutes, then transfer to a plate.
Cook onion, carrots, celery, garlic, thyme, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in pot over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until softened but not browned, about 8 minutes.
Stir in potatoes, tomatoes with juice, broth, and water and simmer, partially covered, until potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes. Stir in kale and cook, uncovered, until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in steak with meat juices, cooked noodles, and salt and pepper to taste.

Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter two 9-inch-diameter springform pans with 2 3/4-inch-high sides. Combine first 6 ingredients in large bowl. Beat until smooth, about 2 minutes. Divide batter between prepared pans. Bake cakes until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 28 minutes. Cool cakes completely in pans on racks.
Using small knife, cut around sides of pans to loosen cakes. Remove pan sides. Using serrated knife, cut each cake horizontally in half. Place 1 cake layer, cut side up, on platter. Spread with 1/4 cup preserves, then 3/4 cup frosting. Top with second cake layer, cut side up. Spread with 1/4 cup preserves, then 3/4 cup frosting. Repeat with third cake layer. Top with fourth cake layer, cut side down. Spread remaining frosting over top and sides of cake. Press almonds onto sides of cake. Chill until frosting sets, about 2 hours. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover; keep chilled.)

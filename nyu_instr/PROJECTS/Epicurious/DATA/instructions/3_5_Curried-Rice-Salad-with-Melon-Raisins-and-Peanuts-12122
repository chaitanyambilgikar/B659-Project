In a large saucepan bring 4 quarts water to a boil, stir in the rice and the salt, stirring until the water returns to a boil, and boil the rice for 10 minutes. Drain the rice in a large sieve and rinse it. Set the sieve over a large saucepan of simmering water and steam the rice, covered with a folded kitchen towel and the lid, for 15 minutes, or until it is fluffy and dry. Transfer the rice to a very large bowl and let it cool to lukewarm.
In a small bowl whisk together 1 1/2 teaspoons of the curry powder, the vinegar, the oil, and salt to taste, add the vinaigrette to the rice, and toss the mixture well. Stir in the raisins and the cantaloupe. In a blender blend the yogurt, the chutney, and the remaining 1 teaspoon curry powder until the dressing is smooth, pour the dressing over the rice mixture, and toss the salad well. Chill the salad, covered, for 1 hour. The salad may be made 2 days in advance and kept covered and chilled. Serve the salad sprinkled with the peanuts.

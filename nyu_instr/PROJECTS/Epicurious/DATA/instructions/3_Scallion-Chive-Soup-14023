In a saucepan cook zucchini, shallots, and garlic in oil and butter over moderately low heat, stirring occasionally, until shallots are tender, about 5 minutes. Add scallions and all but 2 tablespoons chives and cook, stirring, until scallions are softened, about 2 minutes. Stir in broth and water and simmer 2 minutes.
In a blender purée mixture (use caution when blending hot liquids). Pour soup through a fine sieve into cleaned pan, pressing hard on solids and discarding them. Heat soup over moderate heat, stirring, until hot and season with salt and pepper. Stir in remaining 2 tablespoons chives.
Serve soup with Parmesan puffs.

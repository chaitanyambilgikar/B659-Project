Heat olive oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions and sauté until golden, about 7 minutes. Add squid and sauté 1 minute. Add tomatoes, wine, basil, parsley, oregano, tomato paste, and crushed red pepper. Simmer until squid is tender and sauce thickens slightly, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

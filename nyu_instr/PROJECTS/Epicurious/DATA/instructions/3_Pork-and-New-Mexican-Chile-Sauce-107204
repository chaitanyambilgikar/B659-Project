Preheat oven to 375°F.
Roast pork in a 2 1/2- to 3-quart shallow baking dish, uncovered, in middle of oven, stirring occasionally, 30 minutes.
While pork is roasting, soak chiles in a bowl in just enough boiling-hot water to cover until softened, about 20 minutes. Drain chiles, discarding soaking water and stems.
Purée chiles, garlic cloves, garlic powder, 3 cups water, and salt in a blender until smooth. Stir sauce into pork and bake, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until pork is tender, about 45 minutes.

Sprinkle both sides of the squash slices with salt and let the slices drain between paper towels for 10 minutes. Pat the slices dry and brush the top sides with some of the oil. Heat a well-seasoned ridged grill pan over moderate heat until it is hot and in it cook the squash slices, in batches if necessary, oiled-side down first and brushing the tops with some of the remaining oil before turning them, for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, or until they are just tender. Transfer the slices with a spatula to a small platter. In a small bowl whisk together the lemon juice, the orégan, the remaining oil, and salt and pepper to taste, drizzle the dressing over the squash, and sprinkle the squash with the parsley.

Bring sugar, agave syrup, and 2 tablespoons water to a boil in a small deep heavy saucepan, stirring to dissolve sugar. Prop a candy thermometer in pan with bulb submerged in syrup. Boil without stirring until thermometer registers 265°F, 8-10 minutes. Add cream, milk, and butter. Whisk until butter is melted and mixture is smooth.
Remove from heat; add chocolate and whisk until melted and mixture is smooth. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 weeks ahead. Transfer to a microwave-safe bowl. Let cool completely; cover and chill. Reheat in microwave in 10-second intervals, stirring occasionally, until heated through.

Place oatmeal in a serving bowl. (Note: Steelcut oatmeal is best for a hearty, chewy texture, but takes more time to make. If pressed for time, instant oatmeal works as well.)
Top oatmeal with fresh fruit. (Strawberries, bananas, blueberries, nectarines, mangoes, and raspberries all work well singly or combined together.)
Place 1 small scoop of ice cream on top of the fruit. Enjoy a most decadent breakfast.

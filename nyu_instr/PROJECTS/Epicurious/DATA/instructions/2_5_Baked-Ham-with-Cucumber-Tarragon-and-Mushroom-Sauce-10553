In a skillet melt the butter over moderate heat until the foam subsides and in it cook the mushrooms, stirring, until they begin to give off their liquid. Add the cucumber and cook the mixture, stirring, for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the cucumber is softened slightly. Stir in the chopped tarragon, the cream, and the mustard and cook the mixture until it is thickened slightly. Put the ham in a baking dish and spread it with the cucumber mixture. Bake the ham in the middle of a preheated 350°F. oven for 10 minutes, or until it is heated through, and garnish the top with the tarragon sprigs.

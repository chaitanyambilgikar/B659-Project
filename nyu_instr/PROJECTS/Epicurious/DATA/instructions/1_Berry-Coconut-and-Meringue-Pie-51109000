Heat oven to 350°F. In a bowl, toss blueberries with brown sugar, cornstarch, zest, juice and salt; add to pie pan with crust; dot with butter. Place pie on a baking sheet. Bake on lowest rack until crust is golden, 30 minutes. Ten minutes before pie is done, make meringue: In a mixer, whisk egg whites and cream of tartar until very foamy. Gradually beat in granulated sugar until firm peaks form, 8 minutes. Remove pie from oven; spread meringue on top of hot pie; sprinkle with coconut. Return to oven; bake until meringue is browned, 15 minutes.

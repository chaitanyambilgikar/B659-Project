Make sauce: Heat lard in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then sauté garlic and chiles, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add tomatoes and simmer, stirring frequently, until most of liquid is evaporated and tomatoes have broken down to form a sauce, about 15 minutes. Cool sauce, then stir in salt to taste.
Cook first omelet: Whisk together 3 eggs and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a small bowl until blended. Heat 1 tablespoon lard in a 6- to 7-inch nonstick skillet over moderate heat until hot but not smoking and add eggs. As eggs set around edge of skillet, pull cooked portions toward center using a heatproof spatula, letting raw egg flow around and underneath. Repeat until eggs are partially set, about 2 minutes, then spread 1/3 cup black beans evenly over eggs. Shake skillet to loosen omelet and slide out onto a plate, then invert skillet over plate and, wearing oven mitts, hold plate against skillet and reinvert omelet into skillet. Cook 1 minute more, then with spatula lift edge of omelet opposite handle and fold it toward center. Tilt side of skillet opposite handle downward and roll omelet over itself onto a plate. Spoon some of sauce over omelet and serve. Make 3 more omelets in same manner.

Add the garlic and stir for about 1 minute. Add all of the remaining BBQ sauce ingredients, bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 50 to 60 minutes, stirring occasionally, until you have a little over 3 cups sauce. Leave chunky or puree in a blender or food processor. Set aside to cool.

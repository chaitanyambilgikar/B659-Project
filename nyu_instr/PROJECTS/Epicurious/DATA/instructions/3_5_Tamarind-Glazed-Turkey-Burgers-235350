For glaze: Heat oil in heavy medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add ginger and sauté 2 minutes. Add tamarind concentrate, honey, and water and bring to boil. Reduce heat; simmer until thick enough to coat spoon and reduced to 1 1/4 cups, stirring often, about 8 minutes. Cool completely (volume will reduce as glaze cools); mix in lime juice.
Do ahead: Can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and chill.
For burgers: Stir mayonnaise, ginger, salt, jalapeño, black pepper, and 4 teaspoons glaze in large bowl to blend; mix in green onions. Add ground turkey; blend gently (do not pack tightly). Shape mixture into eight 1/2-inch-thick patties. Arrange patties on small baking sheet.
Do ahead: Can be made 8 hours ahead. Cover and chill.
Prepare barbecue (medium heat). Grill rolls, cut side down, until golden, about 2 minutes; transfer to work surface. Grill burgers until cooked through and thermometer inserted into center registers 160°F, about 8 minutes per side. Brush each burger with glaze. Place 1 burger, glazed side down, on each roll bottom; brush each burger with more glaze. Top each with onion, tomato, lettuce, and roll top. Serve, passing remaining glaze separately.
*Sometimes labeled tamarind paste, tamarind concentrate is a dark, seedless paste with a tart-sweet flavor. It's available at Middle Eastern and Indian markets, and at some Asian markets.

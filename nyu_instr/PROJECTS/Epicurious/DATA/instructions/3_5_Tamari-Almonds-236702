Put oven racks in upper and lower thirds of oven and preheat oven to 300°F.
Divide almonds between baking pans, spreading in 1 layer, and bake 15 minutes. Stir together tamari and sugar in a large heatproof bowl until sugar is dissolved. Add hot almonds and stir until coated well. Let stand, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes. Return almonds to baking pans with a slotted spoon, spreading them evenly. Discard any liquid remaining in bowl.
Bake almonds, stirring and switching position of pans halfway through baking, until almonds are dark brown outside and golden inside, about 25 minutes (cut an almond in half to check color).
Cool almonds completely in pans on racks, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes, then transfer to an airtight container.

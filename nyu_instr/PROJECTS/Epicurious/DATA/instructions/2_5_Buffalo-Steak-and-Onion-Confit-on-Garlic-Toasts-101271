Make onion confit: Halve onions and cut each half lengthwise into 6 wedges. In a 2-quart heavy saucepan heat oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and sauté onions, stirring, until edges are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Stir in remaining confit ingredients and simmer, covered, until onions are tender, about 20 minutes. Remove lid and simmer, stirring occasionally, until liquid is slightly thickened and syrupy, about 10 minutes more. Discard star anise. Keep confit warm, covered.
Preheat oven to 450°F.
Trim fat from steaks and cut each steak into 4 equal pieces. Pat steak dry and season with salt and pepper. In a large nonstick skillet heat oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and brown steak on both sides, about 3 minutes total. Transfer steak to a roasting pan and roast in middle of oven about 5 minutes for medium-rare. Let steak stand 5 minutes.
While steak is roasting, halve garlic clove. On a baking sheet in oven with steaks or in a toaster toast bread until golden brown. Immediately rub toasted bread with cut sides of garlic.
Serve steak and onion confit on toasts with roasted beet wedges and garlic-beet purée.

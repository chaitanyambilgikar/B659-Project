If using fresh peas, shell them and cook briefly in boiling water until al dente, then drain well and place in a large bowl. Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons olive oil and crush them coarsely with a potato masher.
If you are using frozen peas, blanch them briefly, drain exceptionally well, and crush before adding the oil, pouring off any more excess water at this stage; add the oil bit by bit and less liberally.
Mash the feta and yogurt together in a shallow bowl. While the peas are still hot, add the feta and toss to combine. This is all about texture, not smoothness, as for a dip. Add the minced garlic.
Now add the scallions and 2 tablespoons shredded mint. Stir in the juice of half a lemon to start with. Season with pepper and a little salt, if you think it is needed; feta is pretty salty. Taste and adjust the seasoning, adding more lemon juice, mint, or olive oil if you like.
Serve in a shallow dish with a mound of warm, grilled pita bread.

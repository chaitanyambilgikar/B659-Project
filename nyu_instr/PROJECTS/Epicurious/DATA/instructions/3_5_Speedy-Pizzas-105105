Preheat oven to 475°F.
Cook onion in oil in a large heavy skillet over moderate heat, stirring, until softened, about 6 minutes. Stir in peppers and salt and pepper to taste.
Toast tortillas directly on burner (gas or electric) over moderately low heat, turning once with tongs, until puffed slightly and browned in spots, about 30 seconds on each side.
Arrange tortillas in 1 layer on a large baking sheet and spoon one fourth of onions and peppers onto each tortilla, leaving a 1/4-inch border around edge. Sprinkle pizzas with cheese and bake in middle of oven until cheese is melted and edges of tortillas are browned, about 5 minutes. Season pizzas with black pepper.

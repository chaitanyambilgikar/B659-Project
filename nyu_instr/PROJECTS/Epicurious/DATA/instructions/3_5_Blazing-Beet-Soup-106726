1. Place the beets in a heavy pot and cover with broth. Bring to a boil, partially covered. Reduce the heat to medium; simmer for 45 minutes or until the beets are tender. Remove the beets to a bowl with a slotted spoon.
2. When the beets are cool enough to handle, slip off the skins and cut beets into pieces. Pour the broth through a fine strainer into another pot to remove any particles.
3. Puree the beets in batches in the bowl of a food processor, adding the broth and water through the feed tube. Remove to a bowl. Add the lemon juice until the right balance of sweet and sour is achieved. Season with salt.
4. Serve soup in small portions, dolloped with sour cream.

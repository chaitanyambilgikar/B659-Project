In a small heavy saucepan cook onion in oil over moderately low heat, stirring, until softened. Stir in garlic, chiles, and rice and cook, stirring occasionally, until rice is translucent, about 1 minute. Add broth and salt and pepper to taste and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and cook pilaf, covered, until liquid is evaporated and rice is tender, about 20 minutes. Fluff pilaf and stir in scallion.

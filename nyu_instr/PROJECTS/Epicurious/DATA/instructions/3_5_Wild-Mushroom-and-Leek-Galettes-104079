Place dried chanterelles in small bowl. Pour enough hot water over to cover chanterelles; let stand until softened, about 30 minutes. Drain. Finely chop.
Melt 2 tablespoons butter in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add leek and shallot; sauté 2 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons butter, then portobellos and chanterelles; sauté until tender, about 5 minutes. Add wine; simmer until liquid is reduced by half, about 2 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons goat cheese; stir until slightly thickened, about 1 minute. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in 2 tablespoons parsley. Remove from heat.
Position rack in center of oven; preheat to 375°F. Line baking sheet with parchment paper. Roll out puff pastry sheet on floured surface to 12x12-inch square. Using 4-inch-diameter biscuit cutter or bowl as guide, cut out 4 pastry rounds. Using small cookie cutters, such as those with leaf shape, cut out decorative designs from remaining pastry, if desired. Place rounds on baking sheet, spacing apart. Spread 1 tablespoon goat cheese atop each. Spread mushroom mixture evenly atop each to within 1/2 inch of edge, dividing equally. Turn pastry edges upward slightly to hold topping in place. Place decorative pastry cutouts on baking sheet around galettes.
Bake until pastry is puffed and golden, about 15 minutes for decorative cutouts and 30 minutes for galettes.
Sprinkle galettes with 1 tablespoon parsley. Top with cutouts, if desired.

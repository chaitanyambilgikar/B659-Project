For relish: Stir vinegar and sugar in small bowl until sugar dissolves; set aside to use as dressing. Combine cucumber, celery, chile, and ginger in another small bowl. Mix dressing into relish by tablespoonfuls to taste.
For wraps: Grind cilantro stems, garlic, and ginger in mini processor to paste.
Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add cilantro paste and stir 1 minute. Add curry powder; stir 30 seconds. Add squid and chile strips. Stir-fry until squid is almost tender, about 1 minute. Stir in fish sauce, oyster sauce, and sugar. Add coconut cream and chicken broth. Stir until sauce thickens slightly, about 1 minute.
Arrange betel leaves on platter. Using slotted spoon, top each leaf with squid mixture. Spoon relish over.

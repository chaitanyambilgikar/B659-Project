Crush the olives lightly with the flat side of a large knife on a cutting board, discard the pits, and in a food processor purée the olives well. Add the anchovies, the tuna, the capers, and the oil and purée the mixture well. Serve the tapenade as a spread for toasted French bread slices or thin slices of chilled daikon radish as an hors d'oeuvre.

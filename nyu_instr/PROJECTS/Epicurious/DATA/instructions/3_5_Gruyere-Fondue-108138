In a medium bowl, combine cream, flour, and Worcestershire sauce, and set aside.
In a large heavy saucepan, sauté onion in butter with bouillon cubes over high heat, stirring until cubes are completely dissolved.
Reduce heat to medium. Add cream mixture, whisking constantly until thickened.
Gradually add cheeses, and stir until melted and smooth. Mixture will become very thick.
Add wine a little at a time and mix well. Wine tends to thin out mixture, so add as much as needed to reach desired consistency and flavor.
Transfer the fondue to a heated fondue pot and keep warm over low heat.

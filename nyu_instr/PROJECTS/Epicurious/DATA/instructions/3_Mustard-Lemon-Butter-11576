In a food processor or in a bowl with a whisk blend together the butter, the mustard, the lemon juice, the Worcestershire sauce, the cayenne, and salt to taste until the mixture is smooth. Transfer the butter to a bowl and chill it, covered, for 8 hours to let the flavors develop. Serve the mustard lemon butter on grilled fish or chicken.

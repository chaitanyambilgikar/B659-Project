Preheat oven to 350°F.
Bring water, orange juice, brown sugar, molasses, zests, and cloves to a boil in a 2-quart saucepan, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Reduce heat and simmer syrup, uncovered, 20 minutes, then discard zests and cloves.
While syrup simmers, heat 1 tablespoon butter in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderate heat until foam subsides, then brown bread slices on both sides in 3 batches, adding 1 tablespoon butter per batch.
Peel and coarsely grate apples. Arrange 4 bread slices in 1 layer in a buttered 2-quart shallow baking dish. Top with one third of apples, cheese, and pine nuts. Repeat layering twice with remaining bread, apples, cheese, and pine nuts. Pour syrup evenly over top and dot with remaining tablespoon butter, cut into bits.
Bake pudding in middle of oven until puffed and golden brown, about 40 minutes. Serve warm.

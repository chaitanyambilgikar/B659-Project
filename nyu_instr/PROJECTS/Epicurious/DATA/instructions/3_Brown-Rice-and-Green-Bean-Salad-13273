In a 2-quart heavy saucepan bring 2 cups water, salted, to a boil and stir in rice. Cook rice, covered, over moderately low heat until water is absorbed, about 40 minutes. Refresh rice in a colander under cold water and drain.
While rice is cooking, in a small saucepan of boiling salted water blanch beans 2 minutes and drain in colander. Rinse beans under cold water and drain.
In a bowl toss together rice, beans, tarragon, oil, and salt and pepper to taste.

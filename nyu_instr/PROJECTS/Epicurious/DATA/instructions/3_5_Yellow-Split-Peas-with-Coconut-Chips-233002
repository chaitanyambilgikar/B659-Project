Rinse and drain peas, then transfer to a bowl and cover with cold water by 1 inch. Let stand at room temperature at least 8 hours or overnight. (Alternatively, cover with boiling water and let stand 30 minutes.) Drain peas.
Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 400°F.
Pierce 2 softest eyes of coconut with a metal skewer or a small screwdriver, then drain and discard liquid. Bake coconut 15 minutes. Break shell with a hammer or back of a heavy cleaver and remove flesh, levering it out carefully with screwdriver or point of a strong knife. Cut one fourth of coconut into thin slices (1 to 2 inches long and 1D16 inch thick) with adjustable-blade slicer or a vegetable peeler.
Heat 1/2 cup ghee in wok over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking. Fry coconut slices in 2 or 3 batches, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, 2 to 4 minutes per batch. Transfer coconut chips with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain. Discard ghee from wok, then wipe out wok and set aside.
Boil 5 cups water in a 3-quart heavy saucepan, then add soaked split peas, ginger, and turmeric. Simmer, covered, stirring occasionally, until peas are just tender, about 20 minutes. Add fresh chiles, garam masala, 2 teaspoons sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon salt and cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until dal is thickened (resembling a thick soup), 30 to 35 minutes.
Heat remaining tablespoon ghee in wok over moderate heat until hot but not smoking, then cook dried chiles, cumin seeds, bay leaves, cinnamon, cardamom, and cloves, stirring, until fragrant and chiles turn just a shade darker, about 1 minute. Stir into dal, along with remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, more sugar if desired (up to 2 teaspoons), and coconut chips. Discard bay leaves.

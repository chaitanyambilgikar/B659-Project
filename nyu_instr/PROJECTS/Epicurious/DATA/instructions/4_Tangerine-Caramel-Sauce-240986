Remove 3 (2- by 1-inch) strips zest from 1 tangerine with a sharp vegetable peeler (preferably Y-shaped), then scrape off any white pith. Juice tangerines. (You will need 1 1/4 cups juice.)
Bring sugar, water, bay leaves, and zest to a boil in a small heavy saucepan over medium heat, stirring until sugar has dissolved, then wash down any sugar crystals from side of pan with a pastry brush dipped in cold water. Boil, without stirring, until sugar is deep amber. Remove from heat, then carefully add tangerine juice (mixture will bubble and steam vigorously) and simmer, stirring, until caramel has dissolved, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in lemon juice and a pinch of salt, then remove from heat and cool. Chill, covered, until ready to serve (sauce will thicken slightly). Discard bay leaf and zest.

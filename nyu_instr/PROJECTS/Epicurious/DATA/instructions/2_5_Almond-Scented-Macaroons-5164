Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter 2 heavy large baking sheets. Combine all ingredients in large bowl; stir to blend well. Drop by scant tablespoonfuls onto prepared baking sheets, spacing 1 1/2 inches apart. Shape cookies into small mounds, about 1 inch in diameter. Press tops slightly to flatten. Bake until pale golden, about 8 minutes. Transfer each baking sheet to rack. Cook cookies on sheets 5 minutes. Using metal spatula, transfer cookies to racks and cool completely. (Can be prepared up to days ahead. Store at room temperature in airtight container.)

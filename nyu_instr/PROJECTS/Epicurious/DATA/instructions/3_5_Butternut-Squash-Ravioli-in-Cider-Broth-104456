Preheat oven to 350°F. Place squash, cut side up, in baking pan. Sprinkle with brown sugar and cinnamon; season with salt and pepper. Drizzle with syrup; dot with 1 tablespoon butter. Pour 1/2 cup water into bottom of pan. Bake until squash is tender, about 1 hour. Cool completely.
Scoop out squash into bowl. Mash. Transfer 3/4 cup squash to medium bowl (reserve remaining squash for another use). Mix in ricotta, 1/4 cup grated Parmesan, 2 tablespoons parsley and thyme. Season with salt and pepper.
Place wrappers on work surface. Place 1 level tablespoon filling in center of each. Brush edges with water; fold each in half, pressing edges to seal. (Ravioli can be made 4 hours ahead. Arrange in single layer on foil-lined baking sheets dusted with flour. Cover and refrigerate.)
Melt 2 tablespoons butter in large pan over medium heat. Add shallots; sauté 1 minute. Add stock and cider; simmer 8 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon parsley. Season with salt and pepper.
Working in batches, cook ravioli in pot of boiling salted water until just tender, about 1 minute. Using slotted spoon, divide ravioli among shallow soup bowls. Bring cider broth to simmer; ladle over ravioli. Top with shaved Parmesan.

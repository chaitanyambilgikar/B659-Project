Melt 1 1/2 tablespoons butter in heavy large skillet over low heat. Add trimmed shallots. Cover and cook until shallots are golden and beginning to soften, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. Add red wine and sugar and stir until sugar dissolves. Simmer mixture without stirring until liquid is reduced to glaze consistency, swirling skillet occasionally, about 20 minutes.
Add apple juice to skillet and continue to simmer until shallots are tender and liquid is reduced to glaze consistency, stirring occasionally, about 16 minutes. Season mixture to taste with salt and pepper. (Glazed shallots can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover tightly and refrigerate. Rewarm glazed shallots over low heat before serving.)

1. Soak the raisins in the Cointreau for 30 minutes.
2. Preheat the oven to 350°F.
3. Lightly butter a 9-inch cake pan. Line the bottom with parchment paper and lightly butter the paper.
4. In a food processor combine the walnuts with 1 tablespoon of sugar and process until finely ground, but not to a paste.
5. Melt the chocolate over a water bath set over medium-high heat. When melted, remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature.
6. In a large bowl cream the butter with the remaining sugar until pale yellow and fluffy. One at a time, add the eggs, beating well after each addition. One at a time, add the ground hazelnuts, the melted chocolate, the orange zest, the bread crumbs, and the raisins with any Cointreau they haven't absorbed, mixing well after each addition.
7. Turn the mixture into the prepared cake pan and bake on the center rack of the oven until the cake has puffed sightly and has a slight crust on top, about 30 minutes. Test for doneness by pressing gently on the center of the cake—it won't spring right back and a slight indentation will remain. Remove the cake from the oven and cool on a wire rack.
8. While the cake is cooling, make the glaze. Melt the chocolate with the butter, stirring occasionally in a small, heavy-bottomed saucepan over low heat. Remove from the heat when melted, and stir to blend well. Set aside to cool. Spread evenly over the top and sides of the cooled cake.

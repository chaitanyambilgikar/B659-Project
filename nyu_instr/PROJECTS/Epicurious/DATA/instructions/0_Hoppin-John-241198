Bring all ingredients except rice to a boil in a large heavy pot, skimming any foam, then simmer, covered, until peas are barely tender, about 30 minutes. Transfer 4 cups peas and 4 cups cooking liquid to a heavy medium pot. Transfer ham hock to a cutting board, then set aside remaining peas and liquid in larger pot.
Discard skin from ham hock and chop meat, discarding bone. Stir rice and ham into smaller pot of peas with 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Bring to a rolling boil. Stir, then simmer, tightly covered, over very low heat until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, about 30 minutes. Remove from heat and let hoppin' John stand 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, simmer remaining peas and liquid, covered, until peas are tender, about 10 minutes. Serve with hoppin' John.

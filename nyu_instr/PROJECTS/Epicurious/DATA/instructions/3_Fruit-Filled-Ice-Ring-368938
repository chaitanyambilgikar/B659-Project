1. Slice 2 green pears into 1/2" wedges and lay skin side down in a 12-cup Bundt or tube pan. Line side of pan with overlapping apple rings from 2 cored red apples. Add water to cover pears by about 1/2" (about 2 cups) and cover about 1/2" up sides of apples. Freeze until set, about 2 hours.
2. Fill mold with cold water to completely submerge fruit. Return to freezer and freeze until solid, 4 hours or overnight.
3. To serve, dip the bottom of the mold into a bowl of hot water to loosen. Invert a plate over mold; turn out ice ring and transfer to your punch bowl. Cheers!

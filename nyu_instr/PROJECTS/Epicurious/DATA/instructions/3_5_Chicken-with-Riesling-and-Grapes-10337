In a large skillet heat the butter and the oil over moderately high heat until the foam subsides, in the fat brown the chicken on all sides for 8 minutes, or until it is golden, and transfer it with tongs to a plate. Reduce the heat to moderately low and in the fat remaining in the skillet cook the shallot and the garlic for 3 minutes. Stir in the flour and cook the roux, stirring, for 2 minutes. Add the Riesling and cook the mixture, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the broth, the lemon juice, the thyme, and salt and pepper to taste and bring the mixture to a boil, stirring. Return the chicken to the skillet with any juices that have accumulated on the plate and simmer the mixture, covered, for 15 minutes. Add the grapes and simmer the mixture, uncovered, stirring occasionally, for 3 to 5 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through.

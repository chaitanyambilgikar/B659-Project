Preheat oven to 325°F. Combine all ingredients except powdered sugar in processor. Using on/off turns, process until mixture resembles coarse meal; then process continuously until dough begins to come together.
Roll 2 teaspoonfuls of dough between palms of hands to form 2 1/2-inch-long rope, tapering at ends. Place on ungreased baking sheet; curl in ends to form crescent shape. Repeat with remaining dough, spacing cookies 1 inch apart.
Bake cookies until just firm to touch, about 20 minutes. Cool on sheet 5 minutes. Transfer to rack; cool. Sift powdered sugar over. (Can be made 3 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.)

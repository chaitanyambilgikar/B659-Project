Line 9x9x2-inch baking pan with foil, leaving overhang. Spray foil with nonstick spray. Combine white chocolate and peanut butter in medium metal bowl. Set bowl over saucepan of barely simmering water (do not allow bottom of bowl to touch water). Stir until chocolate melts and mixture is blended. Spread mixture evenly in prepared pan; freeze until almost firm, about 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, place chocolate chips and cream in another medium metal bowl. Set over same saucepan of simmering water (do not allow bottom of bowl to touch water). Stir until chocolate is melted and mixture is smooth. Spread chocolate mixture evenly over peanut butter mixture. Refrigerate until very firm, at least 3 hours. (Can be prepared 2 days ahead. Cover and keep refrigerated.)
Using foil as aid, lift candy out of pan. Cut into 1-inch squares; serve cold.

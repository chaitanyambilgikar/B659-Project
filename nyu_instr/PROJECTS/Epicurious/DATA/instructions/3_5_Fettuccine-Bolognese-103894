Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium heat. Add onions, celery and garlic and sauté until vegetables are tender and beginning to brown, about 10 minutes. Increase heat to high; add veal, pork and pancetta and sauté until meat is brown, breaking up meat with back of fork, about 10 minutes. Add tomatoes with their juices, 1 3/4 cups stock, milk and thyme. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer uncovered 1 hour 15 minutes, breaking up tomatoes with back of spoon, adding more stock if mixture is too thick and stirring occasionally. Season ragù to taste with salt and pepper.
Cook fettuccine in large pot of boiling salted water just until tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally. Drain. Add fettuccine to pot with ragù and toss to blend. Transfer to large bowl. Sprinkle with 1/2 cup Parmesan. Serve, passing remaining Parmesan separately.

For marinade: Combine ingredients in a large freezer bag; shake for 1 minute. Refrigerate 1 hour.
For relish: Coat a medium skillet with cooking spray; sauté corn and shallot until shallot is caramel in color, about 3 minutes. In a bowl, mix remaining ingredients. Add corn. Season with salt and pepper. Skewer shrimp and grill over medium-high heat (or broil) until pink (about 2 minutes per side). Serve each skewer atop a spoonful of relish.

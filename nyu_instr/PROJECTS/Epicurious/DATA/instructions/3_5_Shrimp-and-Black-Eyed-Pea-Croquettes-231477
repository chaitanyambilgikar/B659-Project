Soak peas in water to cover by 2 inches at least 8 hours and up to 12. Drain in a colander.
Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 250°F. Line a baking sheet with wax paper.
Pulse peas, onion, cilantro, peppers, and 1 teaspoon salt in a food processor until finely chopped, then transfer to a bowl.
Toss shrimp with remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt. Press a scant tablespoon pea mixture around each shrimp, encasing shrimp in a thin even layer but leaving tail (and shell) exposed, then transfer to baking sheet.
Put eggs and panko in 2 separate shallow bowls. Holding 1 shrimp by the tail, dip coated portion of shrimp first into egg, letting excess drip off, and then into crumbs, returning shrimp to baking sheet. Coat remaining shrimp in same manner.
Line another baking sheet with paper towels. Heat 1 1/4 inches oil in a 5- to 6-quart heavy pot (9 to 10 inches in diameter) until it registers 350°F on thermometer. Fry croquettes in 4 batches, turning over once or twice, until deep golden, 2 to 3 minutes per batch, transferring with a slotted spoon to paper-towel-lined baking sheet. Keep fried croquettes warm in oven while frying remainder, returning oil to 350°F between batches.
Serve croquettes immediately.

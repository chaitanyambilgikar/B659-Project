1 Set rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 325 degrees.
2 Place the butter and sugar in the bowl of a heavy-duty mixer and beat on medium speed with the paddle attachment until very light, about 5 minutes. Beat in the vanilla. One at a time, beat in 3 of the eggs, beating until smooth after each addition.
3 Reduce the mixer speed to low and beat in one-third of the four, then another egg, beating until smooth after each addition. Stop the mixer occasionally to scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Beat in another third of the flour, then, after the flour has been absorbed, beat in the final egg. Scrape again and beat in the last of the four.
4 Use the rubber spatula to give a final mix to the batter, then scrape it into the prepared pan and smooth the top.
5 Bake for about 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours, or until the cake is well risen, cracked on top, and well-colored and a toothpick inserted into the center emerges dry.
6 Cool the cake in the pan for a few minutes, then unmold it onto a rack and turn right side up to finish cooling.
VariationsVanilla Bean Pound Cake: Omit the vanilla extract. Split a vanilla bean lengthwise and scrape out the seeds with the point of a paring knife. Add the vanilla seeds to the butter and sugar mixture. The vanilla flavor will be stronger than a cake made with extract, and the visible vanilla seeds make a strong "vanilla statement."
Mace Pound Cake: Add 1/4 teaspoon ground mace to the flour.
Hint of Lemon Pound cake: Add the finely grated zest of a large lemon to Classic Pound Cake or Vanilla Bean Pound Cake.

For crust: Mix flour, coconut, sugar and salt in processor until well blended. Add butter and cut in using on/off turns until mixture resembles coarse meal. Mix in vanilla and enough water to form moist clumps. Knead dough briefly on work surface to combine; flatten into disk. Wrap in plastic and chill until dough is firm, at least 2 hours and up to 1 day.
Preheat oven to 375°F. Divide dough into 6 equal pieces. Roll out each dough piece on lightly floured surface to 1/8-inch thickness. Cut out 6-inch rounds. Line six 4-inch-diameter tartlet pans with removable bottoms and 3/4-inch-high sides with dough rounds. Freeze crusts 15 minutes.
Place tartlet pans on large baking sheet. Bake crusts 10 minutes; pierce with toothpick if crusts bubble. Continue to bake until crusts are pale golden, about 10 minutes longer. Cool crusts on baking sheet. Reduce oven to 350°F.
For filling: Place coconut in medium bowl medium bowl. Add banana slices and toss gently to coat. Stir cream and sugar in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves and mixture comes to boil. Pour cream mixture over banana mixture; gently combine. Spoon filling into prepared crusts.
Bake tartlets on baking sheet until filling bubbles and coconut is lightly toasted, about 25 minutes. Cool tartlets on rack 5 minutes. Carefully push up pan bottoms to free tartlets from pans. Cool tartlets completely and serve.

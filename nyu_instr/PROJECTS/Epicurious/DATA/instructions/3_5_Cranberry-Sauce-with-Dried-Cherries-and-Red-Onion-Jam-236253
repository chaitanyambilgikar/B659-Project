Melt butter in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat. Add onions and pinch of salt. Sauté until soft but not brown, about 7 minutes. Add sugar and five-spice powder; stir until sugar dissolves, about 4 minutes. Add cranberries, cherries, 1/2 cup water, and vinegar. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until most berries have popped, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes. Cool. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Serve at room temperature.

Cook bacon in heavy large skillet over medium heat until fat begins to melt, about 3 minutes. Add cabbage, onion, pears, caraway and bay leaf. Cook until cabbage wilts and onion is tender, tossing frequently, about 10 minutes. Add all remaining ingredients. Cover and cook until liquids are almost absorbed, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.

Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add fennel, asparagus, carrots, and shallots; sauté until crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer vegetables to bowl. Add clam juice, Pernod, and herbs to same skillet; bring to boil. Add halibut fillets. Reduce heat to very low, cover, and simmer until fish is just opaque in center, about 10 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer fish to large shallow soup bowls. Return vegetables to skillet. Add lemon juice and butter; stir until butter melts. Season with salt and pepper. Spoon warm vegetables and broth over fish.

Halve zucchini lengthwise and cut each half crosswise into 1/2-inch pieces.
In a large non-stick skillet heat oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and sauté zucchini with salt and pepper to taste, stirring, until golden and just tender. Stir in parsley.
Serve zucchini warm or at room temperature.

Combine 8 cups water, chicken drummettes, soy sauce, and salt in large bowl. Cover and refrigerate 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 350°F. Bring barbecue sauce, root beer, and minced ginger to simmer in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat. Simmer 5 minutes to blend flavors.
Drain chicken drummettes and transfer to large rimmed baking sheet. Roast 30 minutes. Pour 1/3 of barbecue sauce mixture into small bowl and set aside. Brush chicken drummettes all over with remaining barbecue sauce mixture. Continue roasting until cooked through, about 15 minutes longer. Brush with reserved barbecue sauce. Transfer to platter. Sprinkle chicken drummettes with parsley, sesame seeds, and crushed red pepper and serve.

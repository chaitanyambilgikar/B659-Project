In a large bowl with an electric mixer, cream the butter with the brown sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy and beat in the eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Add the raisins, the chopped currants, the cloves, and the cinnamon and beat the mixture until it is combined well. Dissolve the baking soda in the buttermilk or water, add the mixture to the fruit mixture, and beat the mixture until it is combined well. Into a bowl sift together the flour and the baking powder, add the flour mixture to the fruit mixture, and beat the dough until it is combined well. Chill the dough, covered, for 1 hour, or until it is firm. The dough may be made 1 week in advance and kept covered tightly and chilled.
Preheat the oven to 350°F. Roll rounded teaspoons of the dough into balls, arrange the balls about 1 inch apart on lightly greased baking sheets, and with the flat bottom of a glass dipped in the granulated sugar, flatten the balls into 1 1/2 rounds. Press a whole currant lightly into the center of each round and bake the cookies in batches in the middle of the oven for 10 to 12 minutes, or until they are golden. Transfer the cookies to racks and let them cool. The cookies may be made 2 months in advance and kept frozen in airtight containers.

Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 425°F.
Pat chicken dry and put in a large flameproof roasting pan (not glass) along with onion, carrots, and celery. Drizzle chicken and vegetables with oil and toss to coat, then arrange chicken pieces skin sides down. Roast, stirring once halfway through, until chicken and vegetables are golden brown, 1 to 1 1/4 hours.
Straddle roasting pan (with chicken and vegetables still in it) across 2 burners, then add 1 cup water and deglaze pan by boiling over high heat, stirring and scraping up any browned bits, 1 minute.
Transfer chicken and vegetables with pan sauce to a 6- to 8-quart stockpot and add salt and remaining 12 cups water, then bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, skimming foam from surface, 3 hours.
Pour stock through a large sieve lined with cheesecloth or a triple layer of paper towels, discarding solids. If not using stock right away, cool to room temperature, uncovered, and then chill, covered.

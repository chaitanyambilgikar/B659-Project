Bring sugar, water, and sliced lemongrass to a boil in a saucepan, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Remove from heat and let steep, covered, 20 minutes.
Pour syrup through a fine sieve into a metal bowl (discard lemongrass) and chill until cold.
Freeze syrup in ice-cream maker, then transfer to an airtight container and put in freezer to harden. Serve sorbet with mango slices.

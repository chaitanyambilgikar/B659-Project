Preheat oven to 400°F. Cook bacon and shallots in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat until bacon is crisp, stirring frequently, about 10 minutes. Stir in mashed potatoes and herbs. Mix in 1/4 cup milk, adding more milk if mixture is dry. Season potato mixture with salt and pepper. Transfer to 2-quart gratin dish. Sprinkle cheese over and bake until cheese is beginning to brown, about 30 minutes.

In a small bowl toss together cheese, ground cumin, and cayenne.
On a lightly floured surface roll out pastry into a 14- by 12-inch rectangle and brush with some egg wash. Cut pastry in half crosswise, forming two 12- by 7-inch rectangles. Sprinkle cheese over 1 rectangle and top with other rectangle, egg-wash side down, pressing it firmly to force out any air pockets. Roll pastry out slightly to make layers adhere (rectangle should be about 12 1/2 by 7 1/2 inches). Brush pastry with some remaining egg wash and sprinkle evenly with cuminseed and sea salt.
With a pastry wheel or sharp knife cut pastry into strips about 7 1/2 inches long and 1/2 inch wide. Twist strips and arrange on baking sheets, pressing ends onto sheet to keep strips twisted. Cheese straws may be prepared up to this point 2 weeks ahead. Freeze cheese straws on baking sheets 1 hour, or until frozen, and transfer to a resealable freezer bag. Do not thaw cheese straws before proceeding.
Preheat oven to 425°F. and grease 2 baking sheets.
Arrange half of cheese straws about 1 inch apart on 1 baking sheet and bake in middle of oven 10 to 12 minutes, or until pale golden. Bake remaining cheese straws in same manner.
Serve cheese straws warm at room temperature.

Preheat broiler.
Put fish in a shallow baking pan (1 inch deep) or a large heavy ovenproof skillet, then pat dry and season cavity with salt and pepper. Put rosemary inside cavity and season outside of fish with salt and pepper, then wrap bacon slices around fish.
Broil fish 5 to 7 inches from heat until skin of fish and bacon are crisp, about 5 minutes. Turn fish over gently with a spatula and broil 2 minutes more. Add lemon slices to pan in 1 layer alongside fish and continue to broil until fish is just cooked through and rest of bacon is crisp, 2 1/2 to 3 minutes more.

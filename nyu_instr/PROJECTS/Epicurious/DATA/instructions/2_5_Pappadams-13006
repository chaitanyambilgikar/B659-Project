To fry pappadams: In a heavy kettle heat 1 1/2 inches oil over moderate heat until it registers 365° F. on a deep-fat thermometer and fry pappadams until crisp and golden, 2 or 3 seconds. With tongs transfer pappadams to paper towels to drain briefly.
To broil pappadams: Preheat broiler.
Broil pappadams 4 to 6 inches from heat until they bubble and become opaque, about 10 seconds on each side.

Preheat oven to 400°F. and butter twelve 1/3-cup muffin cups.
Reserve 1/2 cup Cheddar and 1/4 cup pumpkin seeds. Coarsely chop remaining 1/2 cup pumpkin seeds. Into a bowl sift together flour, cornmeal, baking powder, and salt and stir in remaining cup Cheddar and chopped pumpkin seeds. Wearing protective gloves, seed and mince jalapeños. Melt butter and in a small bowl whisk together with jalapeños, milk, and egg. Stir butter mixture into flour mixture until just combined. Divide batter among muffin cups and sprinkle with reserved Cheddar and pumpkin seeds. Bake muffins in middle of oven until golden and a tester comes out clean, about 20 minutes.

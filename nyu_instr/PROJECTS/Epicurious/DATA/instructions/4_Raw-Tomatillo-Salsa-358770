1. Wash the tomatillos well with warm water to remove the naturally sticky coating, which is bitter. Cut them into quarters.
2. Pulse the tomatillos in a food processor with the remaining ingredients until a slightly chunky texture is achieved.
3. Taste for salt and serve as soon as possible to enjoy maximum bite and crunch.

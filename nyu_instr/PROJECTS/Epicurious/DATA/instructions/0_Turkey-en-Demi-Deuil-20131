Cover the backs, necks, gizzards and giblets with 4 to 5 quarts water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and allow to simmer very slowly for about 4 to 5 hours. If you wish a richer broth, add a fowl for the last 2 hours. (The meat may be frozen afterward and used for crêpes, salad or other chicken dishes.) Season to taste with salt and pepper. Strain, cool, and remove excess fat.
Clean the turkey. Slice most of the truffles, slip them under the skin of the turkey breast and thighs and allow to stand for an hour or so.
Bring the broth to the boiling point in a large kettle or braising pan. Add the turkey and bring to the boil once more. Reduce heat and let the turkey simmer, covered, allowing about 20 to 22 minutes per pound. Cook just to the point of maximum juicy tenderness — do not overcook.
Remove the cooked turkey to a large hot platter. Reduce 4 cups of the broth to 2 cups over a brisk flame. Add the Béchamel sauce and blend thoroughly. Blend the heavy cream with the egg yolks and gradually stir into the sauce. Continue stirring until the mixture is smooth and velvety. Season with salt and ground white pepper and add a few finely chopped truffles.
Serve this elegant dish with the sauce, rice and spinach timbales. Drink a delicious young Fleurie.

In a heavy saucepan combine the brown sugar, the corn syrup, the butter, the cream, and the salt, bring the liquid to a boil, stirring, and simmer the mixture for 5 minutes. Add the cranberries and simmer the mixture, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes, or until the berries have burst and the liquid is reduced to about 1 1/2 cups. Serve the sauce warm over ice cream.

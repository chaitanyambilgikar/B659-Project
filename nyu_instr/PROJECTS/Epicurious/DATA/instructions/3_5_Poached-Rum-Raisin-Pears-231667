Combine 1/3 cup rum with remaining ingredients in a 10-inch heavy skillet and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, until pears are just tender, about 10 minutes. Remove lid and boil mixture, stirring occasionally, until liquid is reduced to a syrup, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in remaining tablespoon rum and serve warm or at room temperature.

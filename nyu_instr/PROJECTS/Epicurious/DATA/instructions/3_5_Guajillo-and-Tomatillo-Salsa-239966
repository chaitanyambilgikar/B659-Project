Heat a dry heavy medium skillet (not nonstick) over medium heat until hot, then toast chiles briefly on all sides, pressing flat with tongs, until slightly softened, about 3 minutes.
Simmer tomatillos in water to cover in a small saucepan until tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to a blender and add chiles, onion, garlic, orange juice, and 3/4 teaspoon salt. Blend until smooth (use caution when blending hot liquids). Transfer to a bowl and cool to room temperature.

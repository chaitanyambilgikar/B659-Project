Preheat oven to 350°F.
In a bowl whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt. In a large bowl with an electric mixer beat together butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar until light and fluffy and beat in egg and vanilla until combined well. Gradually beat in flour mixture and oats until combined well. Stir in raisins and chocolate chips.
Drop dough by rounded tablespoons about 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets and bake in middle of oven until golden, about 11 minutes. With a spatula transfer cookies to racks to cool.

For Sauce: Place cornichons, dill and juice in small bowl and stir to blend. Add crème fraîche and stir gently just until combined; do not overmix or sauce will thin out. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Cover; chill.)
For Salmon: Combine first 5 ingredients in large, deep skillet; bring to simmer over medium heat. Simmer 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low. Add half of salmon, cover and simmer until just cooked through, about 7 minutes. Transfer to platter. Repeat with remaining salmon. Cover salmon; chill until cold. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Keep chilled.)
Line platter with lettuce. Top with salmon. Garnish with lemon slices and dill sprigs. Serve with sauce.

Make matzo balls: Beat together eggs and oil in a bowl. Add matzo meal, almonds, dill, salt, pepper, cinnamon, and 1/3 cup stock, stirring until blended. Cover surface of mixture with plastic wrap and chill at least 2 hours.
Shape and cook matzo balls: Bring a 6-quart pot of salted water to a simmer.
Roll matzo mixture into 1-inch balls (about 25) with dampened hands and transfer to an oiled plate.
Cook matzo balls in simmering water, covered, until cooked through, about 40 minutes. To test for doneness, halve a matzo ball: It should have a moist, uniform texture (if it's not quite ready, there will be a dry, yellowish center).
While matzo balls are cooking, bring remaining 6 cups stock to a simmer and season with salt and pepper. Transfer matzo balls with a slotted spoon to broth and simmer, uncovered, 5 minutes. Serve hot.

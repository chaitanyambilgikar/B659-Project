Melt 6 ounces bittersweet chocolate with 1/4 cup water in heavy small saucepan over low heat, whisking until smooth. Cool to just barely lukewarm, about 10 minutes.
Using electric mixer, beat egg whites in medium bowl to form soft peaks. Gradually beat in 1/4 cup sugar until stiff but not dry. Pour cooled melted chocolate over egg whites and gently fold together. Divide mousse among 4 parfait glasses or bowls. Cover; chill at least 6 hours or overnight.
Mix kumquats and remaining 1/4 cup sugar in small saucepan; let stand 10 minutes. Stir slowly over low heat until sugar dissolves. Cover; chill at least 2 hours or overnight.
Beat chilled whipping cream in small bowl to form soft peaks. Spoon whipped cream atop mousse. Top with sugared kumquats and syrup.

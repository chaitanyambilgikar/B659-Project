Melt butter in large skillet over medium-high heat. Add meats; cook until brown, about 1 minute per side. Add onion; sauté until brown, about 5 minutes. Add pears; sauté until tender, about 5 minutes. Using tongs, transfer meats to plate. Add sauerkraut, wine, and allspice to skillet, stirring to scrape up browned bits. Return meats to skillet, arranging atop sauerkraut. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; cover and simmer 10 minutes. Season to taste with pepper. Sprinkle with parsley and serve.

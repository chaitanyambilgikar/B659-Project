1. Wash the clams well in cold water and put into a heavy soup pot. Add 1 chopped onion, the celery, carrot, 1 bay leaf, and the thyme sprigs.
2. Add water and clam juice. Cover the pot and bring to a boil over high heat. Cook until the clams open, shaking the pot occasionally. Remove clams from their shells, pouring any remaining broth back into the pot. Cover the clams and set aside. Strain the broth through a fine sieve and set aside.
3. Add the bacon to the pot and cook over low heat until the fat is rendered and the bacon is slightly crisp, about 10 minutes. Add the remaining chopped onions, the remaining bay leaf, chopped thyme, and butter. Cook for 15 minutes, stirring, to wilt the onions. Add the potatoes and the strained broth. Simmer, partially covered, over medium heat for 12 to 15 minutes or until the potatoes are cooked through. Skim any foam that rises to the surface.
4. Meanwhile, coarsely chop the reserved clams. Add them to the pot along with the cream; simmer over medium heat for 5 to 7 minutes or until the clams are just cooked through. Do not overcook.
5. Season generously with pepper and stir in the parsley. Serve in mugs with oyster crackers, if desired.

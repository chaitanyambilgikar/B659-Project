Combine water and rice in heavy medium saucepan. Bring to simmer. Reduce heat to low. Cover and cook until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, about 20 minutes. Uncover and cool.
Position rack in center of oven; preheat to 350°F. Butter 6- to 8-cup soufflé dish. Place in roasting pan. Whisk milk and next 6 ingredients in large bowl to blend. Stir in raisins and 1 1/2 cups cooked rice (reserve any remaining rice for another use). Pour into dish. Sprinkle nutmeg over. Add enough hot water to roasting pan to come halfway up sides of dish. Bake until pudding is set in center and brown around edges, about 1 hour 5 minutes.
Remove dish from water. Cool pudding at least 15 minutes. Spoon into bowls and serve warm or at room temperature with whipped cream.

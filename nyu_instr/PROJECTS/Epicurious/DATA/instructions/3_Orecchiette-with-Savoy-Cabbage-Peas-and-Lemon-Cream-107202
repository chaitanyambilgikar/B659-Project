Cook pasta in a 6- to 8-quart pot of boiling salted water until al dente.
While pasta is cooking, heat butter in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderately high heat until foam subsides, then sauté cabbage, stirring, until pale golden, about 6 minutes. Add scallions, chicken broth, and cream and bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until cabbage is tender, about 2 minutes.
Remove from heat and stir in peas, zest, dill, salt, and pepper.
Ladle out 1 cup pasta cooking water and reserve, then drain pasta in a colander. Combine pasta with cabbage mixture and 3/4 cup reserved pasta water in a large bowl (or in pot).
If pasta looks dry, moisten with some of remaining water.

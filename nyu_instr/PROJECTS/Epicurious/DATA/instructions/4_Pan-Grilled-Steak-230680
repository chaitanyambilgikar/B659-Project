Directions Marinate the steaks in olive oil for at least 30 minutes. Drain off the oil — leaving a light film of oil on the steaks — and salt the steaks on both sides. Heat a well-seasoned cast-iron skillet over a high setting. When hot add the steaks and char on one side. Turn the heat down to medium and continue cooking for about 3 minutes for medium rare. Turn the steaks with tongs and turn up the heat to high. Be careful not to cut into the steaks while turning so that you don't lose any of the juices. Sear the second side of the steaks, then turn the heat to medium and cook for another 3 minutes to medium rare. Add 2 to 3 minutes per side for well-done steaks. Serve with a green salad, Aji Asado (roasted marinated peppers), and Papas al Horno (roasted potatoes).
Variations: If using an electric oven broiler, char one side of the steaks on a high broil on a preheated broiler pan with the rack as close as possible to the broiler element. When browned, turn steaks with tongs and brown the other side. Total cooking time with this method is about 5 minutes per side for medium rare.
Less time is required for gas broilers and outdoor charcoal barbecues. If using the latter, char meat directly on a rack over very hot coals on the hottest part of the barbecue, then move the meat to a cooler area of the rack over the drip pan leaving the barbecue lid open about one inch. Return the meat to the hotter area to char the second side and then move it back over the drip pan.

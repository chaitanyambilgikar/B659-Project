In a 2-quart saucepan cook mushrooms and shallot with salt to taste in butter over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until liquid mushrooms give off is evaporated and they are golden. Add wine and bring to a boil. In a measuring cup vigorously stir together milk and flour and add to mushroom mixture with cream and cayenne. Simmer cream mixture, stirring occasionally, until mixture is slightly thickened, about 3 minutes.
Toast bread. Add oysters and parsley to cream mixture, stirring gently, and cook at a bare simmer until edges of oysters curl, about 3 minutes. Arrange toast on 2 plates and spoon creamed oysters and mushrooms on top.

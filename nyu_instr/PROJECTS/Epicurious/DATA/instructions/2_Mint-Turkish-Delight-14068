Oil an 8-inch square baking pan and line with plastic wrap. Oil plastic wrap.
In a small bowl sprinkle gelatin over 1/2 cup cold water and let soften. In another small bowl stir together 1/8 cup cold water and cornstarch.
In a 4-quart heavy kettle stir together remaining 1 1/4 cups cold water, granulated sugar, and mint and bring to a boil over moderate heat, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Stir in gelatin and cornstarch mixtures and boil over moderate heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spatula, 10 minutes (mixture will be very thick). Stir in food coloring. Pour mixture into baking pan, smoothing top with spatula, and cool. Chill confection, loosely covered, until set, about 4 hours.
Sift 1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar onto a work surface. Invert confection onto sugar and peel off plastic wrap. Cut confection into 1/8-inch cubes. Sift remaining confectioners' sugar over cubes and toss to coat. Wrap cubes in parchment paper (do not use wax paper, plastic wrap, or airtight containers because confections will weep) and chill. Turkish delight may be made 2 weeks ahead and kept chilled, wrapped in parchment paper.
Just before serving, recoat Turkish delight in additional confectioners' sugar.

Preheat the oven to 350°F. Rinse off the chicken legs, then pat them dry. Put the flour, salt, pepper, and poultry seasoning into a plastic bag and then put in two legs at a time and shake them up to a coat. Break the eggs into a large, flat bowl or soup plate, add a little water, and beat them together. Dip the floured chicken legs in the egg mixture, and then dredge them in the almonds. Lay the legs out on a greased baking pan and bake for about 25 minutes, or until golden brown and juicy. Dot the chicken with the butter pats halfway through cooking to baste them. Serve immediately or place them in the fridge, covered, overnight and serve cold. Note: If you're not that fond of dark meat, you can make Almond Chicken with two fryers cut into pieces, instead of just legs.

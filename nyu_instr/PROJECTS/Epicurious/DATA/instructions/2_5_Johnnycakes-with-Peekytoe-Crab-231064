Mix crabmeat, mayonnaise, chives, and lemon juice in medium bowl to blend. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate. (Can be made 8 hours ahead. Keep refrigerated.)
Bring milk and 1 1/3 cups water to boil in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat. Gradually whisk in polenta, then butter and salt. Remove batter from heat; let stand 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Lightly butter large rimmed baking sheet. Heat large nonstick griddle or skillet over medium-high heat. Brush lightly with vegetable oil. Working in batches, spoon 1 tablespoonful batter for each cake onto griddle, spreading slightly with back of spoon. Cook until cakes are golden brown on bottom and firm at edges, about 2 minutes. Turn cakes over and cook until firm and golden brown, about 1 minute longer. Transfer to prepared baking sheet. (Can be made 8 hours ahead. Cool, then cover with foil and refrigerate. Rewarm, covered, in 350°F oven until hot, about 7 minutes.)

Spread 1 1/2 tablespoons of cranberry sauce on each of 4 slices of bread. Add 2 ounces of cheddar onto each piece, followed by two ounces of roasted turkey.
Cover each prepared bread slice and evenly butter the top of each sandwich. Place each sandwich butter side down in a frying pan over medium heat. While the first side is grilling, butter the second side of bread. Cook until golden and crusty, about 3-4 minutes. Carefully turn and cook until second side is golden, about 2-3 minutes more.

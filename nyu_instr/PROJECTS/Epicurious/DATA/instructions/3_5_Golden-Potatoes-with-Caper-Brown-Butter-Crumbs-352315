Put a 4-sided sheet pan in upper third of oven and preheat oven to 425°F.
Cover potatoes with 2 inches water in a 5-to 6-quart pot and add 1 tablespoon salt. Simmer until almost tender, about 10 minutes. Drain potatoes well.
While potatoes simmer, heat butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat, swirling pan occasionally, until browned and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in capers. Keep warm, covered.
Toss potatoes with 3 tablespoons caper butter, then spread out in hot sheet pan. Stir remaining caper butter into bread crumbs and scatter over potatoes. Roast, turning potatoes once or twice, until potatoes are tender and crumbs are golden, about 20 minutes. Season with salt.

Heat 1 1/2 inches oil in a large wide heavy saucepan until it registers 370°F.
Meanwhile, whisk together flour, baking powder, zest, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a bowl. Whisk together ricotta, eggs, granulated sugar, and vanilla in another bowl, then whisk in flour mixture.
Working in batches, gently drop in level tablespoons of batter and fry, turning occasionally, until deep golden, about 3 minutes per batch. Transfer with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain.
Dust generously with confectioners sugar.

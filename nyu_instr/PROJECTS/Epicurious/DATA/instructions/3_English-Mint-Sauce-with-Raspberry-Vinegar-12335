In a food processor chop fine the mint with the sugar and transfer the mixture to a small bowl. Stir the water into the mixture, stirring until the sugar is dissolved, and stir in the vinegar. Let the sauce stand, covered, for 15 minutes or chill it, covered, overnight. Serve the sauce at room temperature with lamb.

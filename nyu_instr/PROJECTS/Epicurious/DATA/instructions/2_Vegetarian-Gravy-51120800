Preheat the oven to 375°F.
Spread the vegetables and thyme in a single layer in a dry heavy-bottomed flameproof roasting pan. Roast until any juices released by the vegetables have caramelized on the bottom of the pan, about 2 hours. Stir the vegetables using a wooden spoon to scrape up the crust on the bottom and sides of the pan. Continue roasting, stirring occasionally, until there is a brown crust covering the bottom of the pan, about 1 hour.
Transfer the pan to the stove and add 1 cup of water. Bring to a boil, and continue boiling until the water dries out and caramelizes on the bottom of the pan, 3 to 5 minutes. With the pan over high heat, continue to caramelize the vegetables for 10 more minutes, adding drops of water to any dry spots and using a wooden spoon to scrape up the crust forming on the bottom of the pan.
Add 3 cups of vegetable broth or water to the roasting pan and bring to a simmer while scraping the caramelized juices on the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Continue simmering and scraping for about 1 minute.
Pour the liquid and vegetables through a fine-mesh strainer set over a blender, pushing down on the vegetables to release their juices. Add about 3/4 cup of the vegetables to the blender (discard the remaining vegetables) and purée on high for 1 minute. Strain the gravy again, pushing on any remaining solids to help thicken the gravy. Season to taste with salt and pepper and garnish with parsley, chervil, or tarragon, if desired. DO AHEAD: Gravy can be made ahead and kept covered in the refrigerator, up to 3 days. Reheat in a small saucepan over moderate heat.

Put wine, onion, parsley, bay leaf, and garlic in large kettle. Bring to a boil, lower heat and simmer for about 10 minutes. Add fish, making sure that it is barely covered by the stock. Add salt and cook gently for 20 minutes. Stir in beurre manié and cook, stirring until blended and thickened. Taste for seasoning. Serve in deep plates or soup bowls and top each serving with garlic flavored croutons. With this, drink a red Burgundy or a Pinot Noir.

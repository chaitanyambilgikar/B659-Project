Cook artichoke hearts in a 6- to 8-quart pot of boiling salted water until just tender, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a bowl with a slotted spoon. Return water to a boil.
Meanwhile, heat oil and butter in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until foam subsides, then sauté onion, salt, pepper, red-pepper flakes, and zest, stirring occasionally, until onion is softened, about 8 minutes. Add artichokes and sauté, stirring occasionally, 3 minutes. Stir in lemon juice (to taste), then remove from heat and transfer mixture to a large heatproof bowl.
While artichokes are sautéing, cook pasta in boiling water until al dente. Reserve 1 cup pasta-cooking water, then drain pasta in a colander and add to artichoke mixture along with 1/2 cup reserved water. Add parsley and cheese and toss to combine. Season pasta with salt and thin with additional reserved cooking water if desired. Serve with additional cheese on the side.

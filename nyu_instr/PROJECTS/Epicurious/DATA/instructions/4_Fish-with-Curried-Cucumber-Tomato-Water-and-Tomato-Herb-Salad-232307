Make cucumber tomato water: Purée cucumber, tomato, curry powder, and salt in a blender until smooth, about 30 seconds.
Line a fine-mesh sieve with a dampened paper towel and set over a large glass measure, then transfer cucumber mixture to sieve and let drain until liquid measures 2/3 cup, about 20 minutes.
If liquid measures less than 2/3 cup, gently squeeze paper towel over sieve until liquid totals 2/3 cup. Discard solids and transfer liquid to a 2- to 3-quart saucepan.
Boil cucumber tomato water until reduced to about 1/3 cup, then remove from heat and cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes.
Make tomato herb salad: Cut peel, including all white pith, from lemon with a sharp paring knife. Working over a bowl, cut segments free from membranes, letting segments fall into bowl, then chop segments, reserving juice in a cup.
Gently toss lemon segments and reserved juice with remaining salad ingredients in a large bowl. Stir in cooled cucumber tomato water.
Bake fish: Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 500°F.
Rinse fish and pat dry. Brush fillets all over with oil and season with salt and pepper.
Bake fillets in 1 layer in a lightly oiled shallow baking pan until just cooked through, 4 to 8 minutes, depending on thickness of fillets.
Serve tomato herb salad on top of fish.

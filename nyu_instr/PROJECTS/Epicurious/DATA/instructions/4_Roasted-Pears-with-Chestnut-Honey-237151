1. Preheat the oven to 350°F.
2. In an oven-safe pan large enough to hold the pears in a single layer simmer the honey over medium-high heat until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes.
3. Place the pears, cut sides up, and the butter in the pan. Sprinkle with the cinnamon, if desired. Reduce the heat to low and cover the pan. Cook, turning and basting once or twice, until pale golden and not quite tender, 5 to 7 minutes.
4. Transfer the pan to the oven and continue to roast, turning once or twice, until golden brown and tender, 5 to 7 minutes more. Serve warm or at room temperature, drizzled with the honey from the pan. If desired, season with black pepper and fresh thyme.

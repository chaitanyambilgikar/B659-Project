Make caramelized walnuts: Preheat oven to 350°F.
In baking pan toast nuts in oven until golden and fragrant, about 10 minutes. In a small bowl stir together caramelized-walnuts ingredients and in a small nonstick skillet cook over moderate heat, stirring, until sugar caramelizes and coats nuts. Transfer mixture to a bowl and cool. Break walnuts apart.
Make dressing: Mince and mash garlic to a paste with salt and in a bowl whisk with mustard and lemon juice. Add oils in a slow stream, whisking until emulsified and whisk in tarragon and salt and pepper to taste.
Trim endive and cut into julienne strips. Discard coarse stems from watercress and toss with endive and dressing. Top salad with Roquefort and walnuts.

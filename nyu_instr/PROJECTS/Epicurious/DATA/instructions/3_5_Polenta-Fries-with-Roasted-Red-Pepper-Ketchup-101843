Lightly oil 13 x 9-inch metal baking pan. Bring milk, 1 cup water and butter to boil in heavy large saucepan. Gradually whisk in cornmeal. Reduce heat to low and cook until polenta is very thick and starts to pull away from sides of pan, stirring often, about 8 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in cheese, basil and thyme. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Immediately transfer polenta to prepared baking pan, spreading evenly to cover. Refrigerate until cool and firm, about 1 hour. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and keep refrigerated.)
Cut polenta lengthwise in pan into three 3-inch-wide rectangles. Cut each rectangle crosswise into 3/4-inch-wide strips. Set polenta strips aside.
Preheat oven to 300°F. Heat 1/2 cup oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Place flour in pie plate. Lightly coat polenta strips with flour; shake off excess. Working in batches, fry polenta strips until golden brown on all sides, adding more oil if necessary, about 5 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer fries to paper towels and drain. Place fries on baking sheet and keep warm in oven while cooking remaining batches. Transfer fries to large platter and serve with Roasted Red Pepper Ketchup.

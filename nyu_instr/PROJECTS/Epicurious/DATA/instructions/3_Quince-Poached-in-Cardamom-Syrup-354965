Peel quinces, then quarter and core. Cover with water in a bowl (to prevent discoloration).
Bring water, sugar, citrus slices, and cardamom pods to a simmer in a small pot, stirring until sugar has dissolved.
Cut quince quarters into 1/4-inch-thick wedges and add to syrup. Return to a simmer and cover quince with a round of parchment paper. Simmer until quince is just tender, about 45 minutes. Discard citrus slices. Cool quince in syrup to room temperature, about 1 hour (color will deepen). Discard cardamom pods.

Bring broth and wine to simmer in medium saucepan. Reduce heat; keep hot.
Heat oil in heavy large saucepan over medium heat. Add pancetta; sauté until cooked through, about 5 minutes. Add squash and onion; stir to coat. Add rice; sauté 1 minute. Add 2 cups hot broth mixture. Adjust heat so that liquid bubbles gently. Stir until liquid is absorbed. Continue adding hot broth 1 cup at a time until rice is just tender, simmering until liquid is absorbed before each addition and stirring often, about 20 minutes.
Mix butter and 2 tablespoons Parmesan into risotto. Season with salt and pepper. Spoon risotto into bowl. Serve, passing additional Parmesan separately

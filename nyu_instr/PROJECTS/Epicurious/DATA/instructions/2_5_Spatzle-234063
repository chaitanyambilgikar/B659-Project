In small bowl, beat together egg yolks, egg, and milk.
In medium bowl, whisk together flour, nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Add egg mixture to flour mixture and mix with wooden spoon just until well blended. (Do not overmix.) Refrigerate, covered, at least 1 hour or overnight.
Bring large pot salted water to boil. Fill large bowl with ice water. Place spätzlemaker, perforated sheet pan, or large-holed colander on top of pot. Force one-third of batter through holes into water. Cook until spätzle float to surface, 4 to 5 minutes, then transfer immediately with slotted spoon to bowl of ice water. Make 2 more batches in same manner.
When spätzle are cool to touch, drain well and toss with 1/4 cup oil. (Spätzle can be prepared up to this point and refrigerated, covered, up to 2 days.)
In large sauté pan over high heat, heat remaining 1/4 cup oil. Add spätzle and cook, without moving pan, until undersides are brown, about 2 minutes. Add butter and sauté until golden brown, about 2 minutes more. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with parsley and serve.

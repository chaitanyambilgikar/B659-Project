For the marinade: Toast the allspice berries in a dry skillet over medium heat until fragrant. Finely grind them with the cinnamon stick in a spice mill. Transfer to a food processor.
Add all of the remaining marinade ingredients to the processor and blend until smooth.
Season the pork chops with salt and pepper, then rub them all over with the marinade. Place on a plate, cover, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or, preferably, overnight.
Prepare a medium-hot fire in a grill.
Remove the pork from the marinade, place on the grill, and grill, turning once, for about 7 minutes on each side; the internal temperature of the chop should be 140 degrees for medium, 150 degrees for well-done. The thinner the chops, the less cooking time required.
Serve with the chutney.
Recommended wine: A Pinot Noir from Oregon with cherry-cola fruit, soft tannins, and low alcohol.

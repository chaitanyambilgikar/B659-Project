Pour 1/2 cup broth into shallow bowl. Place flour in another shallow bowl. Sprinkle steak pieces on both sides with salt and pepper. Dip steaks into flour, then into broth, then into flour again, coating each time.
Melt butter in large nonstick skillet over high heat. Add steaks. Sauté until brown, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to plate.
Pour off butter from skillet. Add 1 teaspoon flour from shallow bowl. Whisk in remaining 1/2 cup broth, sausage, cream, sage, and cloves. Boil gravy until thick enough to coat spoon, whisking often, about 3 minutes; season with salt and pepper. Mix in green onion tops. Spoon gravy over steaks.

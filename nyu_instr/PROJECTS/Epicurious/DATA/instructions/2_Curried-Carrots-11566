In a large saucepan of boiling water boil the carrots for 3 minutes, or until they are crisp-tender, and drain them well. In a heavy skillet melt the butter over moderate heat, stir in the curry powder, and cook the mixture until it foams. Add the carrots, cook the mixture, stirring, for 1 minute, or until the carrots are tender, and stir in the lemon juice and salt and pepper to taste.

In a large bowl whisk together the buttermilk, the mustard, the salt, and the sugar, add the chopped shrimp, the chopped cucumber, and the chives, and stir the soup until it is combined well. Chill the soup, covered, for 3 hours, or until it is very cold. Garnish each serving with 1 shrimp half and a slice of cucumber.

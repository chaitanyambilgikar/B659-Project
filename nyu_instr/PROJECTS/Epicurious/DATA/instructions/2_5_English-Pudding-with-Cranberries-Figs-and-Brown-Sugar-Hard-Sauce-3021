Generously butter 2 1/2-quart charlotte mold, pudding mold or thick heatproof glass bowl. Sift flour, cinnamon, ginger, baking powder, salt, cloves and nutmeg into large mixing bowl. Add all dried fruit and toss to coat. Mix in crumbs. Whisk brown sugar, eggs, butter, maple syrup, liqueur, rum, grated tangerine peel and vanilla in medium bowl to blend. Pour over dry ingredients and stir until well combined (batter will be thick).
Spoon batter into prepared mold. Smooth top. Cover mold tightly with double thickness of foil. Place rack in large pot. Set pudding on rack. Pour enough hot water into pot to come halfway up sides of mold. Cover pot. Bring water to simmer over medium-low heat. Steam pudding until wooden skewer inserted into center comes out clean, adding more boiling water to pot as necessary, about 5 hours.
Transfer mold to cooling rack; uncover and cool 30 minutes. (Can be made up to 2 months ahead. Remove pudding from mold; cool completely. Wrap tightly in plastic and refrigerate. To reheat pudding, unwrap and return to buttered mold; cover. Place mold on rack in large pot. Pour enough hot water into pot to come halfway up sides of mold. Cover pot; steam pudding over medium-low heat until heated through, about 1 hour. Transfer to cooling rack. Let stand 30 minutes.)
Turn warm pudding out onto platter. Garnish with tangerine peel twists and fresh cranberries, if desired. Serve with Brown Sugar Hard Sauce.

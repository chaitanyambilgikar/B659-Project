Spray six 3/4-cup ramekins or custard cups with nonstick spray. Place 3 tablespoons pomegranate juice in small bowl. Sprinkle gelatin over; let stand 10 minutes. Meanwhile, heat remaining 2 cups pomegranate juice, sugar, and peel in large saucepan over high heat, stirring to dissolve sugar. Boil until syrup is reduced to 1 1/4 cups, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat.
Remove peel from pan; transfer 1/3 cup syrup to small bowl and reserve for sauce. Add gelatin mixture to remaining hot syrup in pan, and stir until dissolved. Add orange juice and whipping cream, then buttermilk. Strain. Divide among prepared ramekins. Chill until set, at least 4 hours or overnight. Cover and chill sauce separately.
Run knife around edge of ramekins; invert onto plates. Drizzle with sauce and serve.

Discard crusts from bread and cut bread into 40 (1 1/2-inch) triangles. Arrange triangles in a shallow baking pan (1 inch deep), then brush tops with butter and sprinkle with salt. Bake until golden, 10 to 12 minutes, then cool.
If using large herring, discard skin and dark flesh. Cut large or small herring into 1/4-inch pieces. Whisk together remaining ingredients in a bowl, then stir in herring. Top each toast with 1/2 teaspoon curried herring.
*Look for jarred fillet pieces of herring (sometimes labeled "Tidbits") sold in the refrigerated section of the supermarket.

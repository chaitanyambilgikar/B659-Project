In a food processor or in a large bowl with a pastry blender pulse or blend flour and salt. Cut butter into small pieces. Add butter to flour mixture and pulse or blend until mixture resembles coarse meal. Measure 1/3 cup goat cheese, reserving remainder for serving, and break into small pieces. Add cheese to flour mixture and pulse or blend until mixture just begins to form a dough. Halve dough and roll out each half between sheets of parchment paper into a 12- by 10-inch rectangle (about 1/8 inch thick). Chill rectangles in parchment on baking sheets until firm, about 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375°F. Transfer 1 rectangle of dough on baking sheet to a work surface and remove top sheet of parchment. Working quickly and using a ruler as a guide, cut rectangle into 1 1/4-inch squares without separating squares. (If dough becomes too soft to work with, freeze or chill on parchment and baking sheet until firm.)
Bake crackers on parchment and baking sheet in middle of oven until golden, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool crackers on parchment on a rack. (Crackers will continue to crisp as they cool.) Cut and bake more crackers with remaining rectangle of dough. With a spatula carefully remove crackers from parchment. Goat-cheese crackers may be made 5 days ahead and kept in an airtight container at room temperature.
Spread crackers with reserved goat cheese at room temperature and top with tapenade.

Preheat oven to 425Â°F. Brush 15 x 10 x 2-inch baking dish with olive oil. Rub fish inside and out with 1 tablespoon oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Sprinkle fish cavities with crushed fennel seeds. Arrange fish in prepared baking dish; drizzle with 1/2 cup Pernod. Cover tightly with foil. Bake until fish is almost cooked through, about 25 minutes. Meanwhile, heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add sliced fennel and sautâ€© until tender, about 10 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Sprinkle sautéed fennel over fish. Bake uncovered until fish is opaque, about 5 minutes longer. Garnish fish with reserved fennel fronds. Serve hot with lemon wedges.

Preheat oven to 300°F. Using sharp knife, score skin of duck breasts diagonally to create 3/4-inch-wide diamond pattern; pat dry. Sprinkle duck with salt and pepper. Heat heavy large skillet over high heat. Add duck breasts, skin side down. Cook until skin is deep golden brown, about 8 minutes. Turn duck over; cook about 3 minutes for medium-rare. Transfer to rimmed baking sheet and keep warm in oven.
Pour all but 1 tablespoon drippings from skillet. Add oil. Reduce heat to medium-high. Add mushrooms and shallots and sauté until mushrooms are tender, about 8 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add wine and stir until juices thicken, scraping up browned bits, about 1 minute.
Place 1 duck breast on each of 4 plates. Pour mushroom sauce over, sprinkle with parsley, and serve.

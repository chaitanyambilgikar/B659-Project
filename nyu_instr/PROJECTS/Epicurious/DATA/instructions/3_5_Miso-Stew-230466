Soak arame in 1 cup filtered water in a small bowl and set aside.
Wash quinoa in 3 changes of cold water in a bowl, draining quinoa in a sieve each time, then put quinoa in a 2- to 3-quart saucepan with kombu and 1 cup filtered water. Simmer, uncovered, until quinoa is just tender, about 20 minutes. Drain in a sieve.
About 10 minutes before quinoa is done, cook onion in oil in a 3- to 4-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat, stirring frequently, until it begins to brown, about 5 minutes, then add garlic and cook, stirring, 30 seconds.
Add tofu, carrot, shiitakes, and remaining 2 1/2 cups filtered water and simmer, covered, until carrot is just tender, about 5 minutes. Remove kombu from quinoa and discard. Stir quinoa into stew, then remove from heat.
Put miso in a small bowl and add 1/4 cup stew liquid, whisking until miso is incorporated, then stir mixture into stew. Drain and rinse arame and add to stew along with bok choy and tamari, stirring to combine.
Divide stew between 2 bowls and sprinkle with scallion and dulse flakes.

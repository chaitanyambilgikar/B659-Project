Preheat oven to 500°F. Lightly grease a large baking sheet and sprinkle with cornmeal.
Make dough: In a food processor combine 1 cup flour, yeast, and sugar and with motor running add water. Turn motor off and add remaining dough ingredients. Process mixture until it forms a ball and process 15 seconds more to knead it.
Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead 10 times. Reserves half of dough for making 2 more pizzette another time, wrapping it in a sealable plastic bag, pressing out excess air, and chilling or freezing. Reserved dough keeps, chilled, 1 day or, frozen, 1 month.
Halve remaining dough and on lightly floured surface roll out each half into an 8-inch round. Transfer rounds to baking sheet and brush lightly with oil. Top rounds evenly with remaining ingredients and season with salt and pepper.
Bake pizzette in lower third of oven 10 to 12 minutes, or until crusts are golden and cheese is golden and bubbling.

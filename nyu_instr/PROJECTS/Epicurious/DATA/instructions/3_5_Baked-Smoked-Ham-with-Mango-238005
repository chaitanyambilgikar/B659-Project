Arrange rack in bottom third of oven and preheat to 350°F.
Trim any tough rind and fat from ham, leaving 1/4-inch-thick layer of fat. Transfer ham to roasting pan. Scatter onions and mangos around pan and pour nectar over ham. Cover pan tightly with foil and bake 2 hours. Remove foil, increase oven temperature to 400°F, and continue to bake, basting with pan juices occasionally, until ham is lightly browned and mangos and onions are very tender, 30 to 45 additional minutes.
Transfer ham to carving board. Using slotted spoon, transfer mangos and onions to medium bowl and keep warm. Transfer pan juices to small saucepan and set over moderate heat. Simmer, uncovered, until slightly thickened and reduced, about 5 minutes.
Slice ham and arrange on platter. Garnish with mangos and onions and serve, accompanied by pan juices.

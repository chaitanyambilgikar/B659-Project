Preheat oven to 400°F. Mix first 5 ingredients in processor. Add shortening and butter. Using on/off turns, process until mixture resembles coarse meal. Whisk sour cream, egg and almond extract in small bowl to blend. Add to flour mixture in processor and pulse just until dough forms ball. Transfer dough to lightly floured work surface.
Press dough into 15 x 3-inch rectangle. Cut into six 3 x 2 1/2-inch pieces. Cut each piece diagonally in half to form 12 triangles. Place scones on heavy large baking sheet, spacing 1 inch apart. Bake until puffed and pale golden, about 15 minutes. (Can be made 1 week ahead. Cool. Wrap in foil and freeze. Thaw, then rewarm in foil in 350°F oven for 8 minutes.)

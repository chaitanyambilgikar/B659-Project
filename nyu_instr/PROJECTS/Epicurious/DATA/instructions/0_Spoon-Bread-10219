Preheat oven to 375°F. Butter a 2-quart soufflé or glass baking dish and coat with bread crumbs, knocking out excess. Chill dish.
In a large metal bowl set over a pan of simmering water heat milk until very hot and gradually add cornmeal, whisking constantly. Cook mixture, stirring frequently, until thick and smooth, about 5 minutes. Remove bowl from pan and stir in butter. Cool mixture and stir in salt, sugar, and egg yolks until combined well.
In a bowl with an electric mixer beat egg whites until they just hold stiff peaks. Gently fold egg whites into cornmeal mixture until just combined.
Pour batter into prepared pan and bake in middle of oven until puffed and golden, about 40 minutes.

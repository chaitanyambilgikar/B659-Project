Make salsa In medium bowl, toss together all ingredients. Transfer to serving dish and set aside.
Prepare grill If using charcoal grill, open bottom vents. Light charcoal. Leaving about 1/4 of grill free of charcoal, bank lit charcoal across rest of grill so coals are about 3 times higher on opposite side.
If using gas grill, open hood, light all burners, and set on high. Close hood and preheat 10 minutes.
While grill is heating, coat chops Using electric spice grinder, pulse cumin seeds 2 to 3 times to crack. (Alternatively, place seeds on cutting board and crush lightly with small sauté pan, using gentle rocking motion.) Rub chops with oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and coat with cumin seeds, pressing firmly to adhere.
To cook chops using charcoal grill Charcoal fire is medium-hot when you can hold your hand 5 inches above rack over area where coals are piled highest for 3 to 4 seconds. Sear chops on lightly oiled grill rack directly over hottest part of coals, turning over once, until well browned, about 3 to 4 minutes per side. Move chops to coolest part of grill, then cover with inverted roasting pan and grill, turning over once, until thermometer inserted diagonally into center of each chop (avoid bone) registers 145°F, about 12 minutes total. Transfer chops to platter and let stand, loosely covered with foil, 5 minutes (temperature will rise to 150°F). Serve, passing salsa on side.
To cook chops using gas grill When grill is preheated, sear chops on lightly oiled grill rack, turning over once, until well browned, about 3 to 4 minutes per side. Turn off 1 burner (middle burner if there are 3) and put chops above shut-off burner. Reduce heat on remaining burner(s) to moderate and grill pork, covered with lid, until thermometer inserted diagonally into center of each chop (avoid bone) registers 145°F, about 12 minutes total. Transfer chops to platter and let stand, loosely covered with foil, 5 minutes (temperature will rise to 150°F). Serve, passing salsa on side.

Preheat oven to 350°F. Using melon baller or small spoon, scoop out core from each pear half. Melt butter in large ovenproof skillet over medium heat. Whisk in brown sugar and salt. Arrange pears, cut side down, in skillet in single layer. Spoon some of sugar mixture over pears. Place skillet in oven; bake until pears are tender, basting once with syrup, about 30 minutes. Transfer pears, cut side up, to large shallow bowl, leaving syrup in skillet. Mix Scotch and vanilla extract into syrup. Using oven mitts as aid, place hot skillet over medium-high heat (mixture may ignite). Cook until syrup is reduced by half, whisking often, about 2 minutes. Spoon syrup over pears and serve.

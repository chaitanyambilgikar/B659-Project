Make the marinade: In a small bowl, combine the vegetable oil, shallots, garlic, lemongrass, sesame seeds, oyster sauce, fish sauce, and caramel sauce,
Heat an outdoor grill or grill-pan. Soak 30 bamboo skewers in warm water for 30 minutes. Cut the pork shoulder into 3-inch strips, 1 1/2 inches wide and 1/8 inch thick. Thread the pork onto the skewers. Brush both sides of the pork with the marinade and season with salt. Grill over moderately-high heat until done, 4-5 minutes.

Cook spinach according to package directions.
Cover eggs with cold water by 1 inch in a 2-quart heavy saucepan and bring to a rolling boil, partially covered. Reduce heat to low and cook, covered, 30 seconds. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, 15 minutes. Transfer eggs with a slotted spoon to a bowl of ice and cold water and cool 1 minute. Peel eggs and quarter lengthwise.
While eggs are standing, cook onion in oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat, stirring occasionally, until softened and browned, about 8 minutes. Add half-and-half, thyme, and nutmeg and briskly simmer, stirring occasionally, until liquid is reduced by one third and slightly thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Add spinach, salt, and pepper and simmer, stirring occasionally, until spinach is heated through, about 2 minutes.
Transfer spinach mixture to a serving dish, then top with eggs and season with salt and pepper.

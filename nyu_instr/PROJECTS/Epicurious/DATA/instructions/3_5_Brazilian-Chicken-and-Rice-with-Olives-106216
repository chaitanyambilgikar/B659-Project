Sprinkle chicken lightly with salt and generously with ground black pepper. Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken, garlic, and peel; sauté until chicken is lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Add 1 cup water and orange juice and bring to boil. Mix in rice, seasoning packet, and olives. Return to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; cover and cook until liquid is absorbed and rice is tender, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat; let stand covered 10 minutes.
Stir cilantro into rice mixture. Transfer to platter. Garnish with orange wedges.

Make beignet batter: Whisk together egg and cream in a small bowl until combined.
Whisk together flour, salt, and pepper in a large bowl, then add okra, bell pepper, and onion, tossing to coat. Stir in egg mixture until combined well. Let stand 20 minutes, then stir in rice.
Make sauce while batter stands: Stir together all sauce ingredients until combined. Chill, covered, until ready to serve.
Fry beignets: Preheat oven to 200°F.
Heat 1 1/2 inches oil in a wide 4- to 6-quart heavy pot until thermometer registers 350°F. Carefully add level tablespoons of batter to oil 1 at a time and fry (in batches of 10 to 12), turning over once, until golden, 2 to 5 minutes per batch. Drain fried beignets briefly on a rack set over paper towels, then transfer to a baking pan and keep warm in oven while frying remaining batter. (Return oil to 350°F between batches.)
Serve immediately, with sauce.

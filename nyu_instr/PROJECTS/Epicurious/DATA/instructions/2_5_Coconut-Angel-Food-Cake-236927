Cake: Heat oven to 325°F. Beat egg whites and salt in a bowl with an electric mixer on medium until frothy, about 2 minutes. Add cream of tartar. Beat until soft peaks form, about 5 minutes. Increase speed to high. Add 1/2 cup sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, until whites form soft, glossy peaks. Beat in vanilla and lemon juice. In another bowl, mix remaining 1/2 cup sugar with flour. Sift 1/2 sugar-flour mixture over egg whites; gently but thoroughly fold into batter using a large spatula. Repeat twice with remaining sugar-flour mixture. Fold in dry coconut in 2 batches. Scrape batter into an ungreased 10-inch angel food tube pan with a removable bottom. Smooth top into even layer. Bake 35 minutes or until top is lightly browned and cake springs back when you press it. Turn pan upside down and rest on the neck of a glass bottle to cool. Run a knife against insides of pan to loosen cake; remove pan. Loosen cake from bottom of pan; invert onto a plate. Cover with plastic wrap. Store at room temperature or in the refrigerator.
Sauce: Boil all ingredients in a medium saucepan 1 minute, until lightly thickened. Let cool. Cover; refrigerate 1 hour. Before serving, sprinkle top of cake with coconut shavings. Serve slices with 3 tablespoons sauce.

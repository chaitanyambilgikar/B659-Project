Cut slices from very good, crusty white bread. Grill them to a light brown.
Place the slices on a plate or a tray, keeping one or two aside.
Blanket thickly with freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, letting some cheese drop onto the plate or tray.
Pour enough olive oil over the cheese to soak it thoroughly, letting some oil spill onto the plate or tray.
When you have eaten the cheese and oil crostini, use the reserved slices to wipe the plate or tray clean. These may taste even better than the first.
Your fingers will get sticky handling this. Italian children lick theirs clean.

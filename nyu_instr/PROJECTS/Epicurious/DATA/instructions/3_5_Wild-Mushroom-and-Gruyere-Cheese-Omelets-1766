Melt 1 tablespoon butter in heavy small skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms, shallots and garlic and sauté until tender, about 3 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Set aside.
Combine eggs, 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley and 1/4 cup grated cheese in medium bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Beat to blend. Heat medium omelet pan or skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1/2 tablespoon butter; heat until butter melts and foam begins to subside. Add half of egg mixture. Stir with flat side of fork until eggs begin to set. Cook until omelet is set, lifting edge with spatula to let uncooked egg flow under. Top with 1/4 cup grated cheese and half of mushroom mixture. Fold omelet into thirds and turn out onto plate. Repeat with remaining 1/2 tablespoons butter, egg mixture, 1/4 cup grated cheese and mushrooms. Sprinkle omelets with additional chopped fresh parsley.

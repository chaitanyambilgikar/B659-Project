1. Place the flour in a medium-size bowl. Slowly whisk in the cider to form a smooth batter, then whisk in the egg yolks and the salt. Whisk vigorously for several minutes, until the batter is smooth and the ingredients are thoroughly combined.
2. In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until soft peaks form and then fold them into the batter.
3. Heat a 10 inch (25.5 cm) nonstick or cast-iron skillet or crêpe pan over medium-high heat. Brush it lightly with clarified butter.
4. Pour one half cup of the batter in the center of the skillet and quickly rotate the skillet to spread the batter as evenly as possible across the bottom. It won't cover the entire bottom, which is fine. The galettes end up being about 9-inches (22.5cm) in diameter.
5. Cook the galette until golden on one side, about 1 minute. If it is browning too quickly, reduce the heat slightly. Turn the galette over in the skillet and continue cooking just until it is set on the other side, an additional 1 minute. Serve the galettes immediately, hot from the skillet.

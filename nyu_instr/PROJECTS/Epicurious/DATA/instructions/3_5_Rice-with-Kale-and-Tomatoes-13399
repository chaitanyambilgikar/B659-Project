In a small heavy saucepan bring 1 cup water to a boil, add the rice and salt to taste, and cook the rice, covered, over low heat for 20 minutes, or until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender. In a heavy skillet cook the garlic in the oil over moderately low heat, stirring, until it is golden, add the tomatoes and the kale, and cook the mixture, stirring occasionally, for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the kale is tender. Fluff the rice with a fork and in a bowl combine well the rice, the kale mixture, and salt and pepper to taste.

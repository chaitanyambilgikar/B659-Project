For crust: Blend flour, sugar, and salt in processor 5 seconds. Add shortening and butter. Using on/off turns, blend until coarse meal forms. Add 3 tablespoons ice water; blend briefly. Add more ice water, 1 teaspoon at a time, and blend, using on/off turns, until moist clumps form. Gather dough together; flatten into disk. Wrap in plastic and chill at least 1 hour and up to 1 day.
Preheat oven to 400°F. Roll out dough on lightly floured surface to 13-inch round. Transfer dough to 9-inch-diameter glass pie dish. Trim overhang to 3/4 inch. Fold overhang under and crimp edge decoratively. Pierce crust all over with fork. Freeze 10 minutes. Line crust with foil; fill with dried beans or pie weights. Bake crust until sides are set, about 25 minutes. Remove foil and beans. Bake crust until beginning to color, pressing with back of fork if crust bubbles, about 10 minutes longer. Remove from oven; brush crust with some of egg white to seal. Reduce oven temperature to 350°F.
Meanwhile, prepare filling: Mix flour and brown sugar in medium bowl. Add butter; cut in with back of fork until blended and even-size crumbs form. Combine 1 cup hot water and espresso powder in another medium bowl. Add baking soda. Whisk in corn syrup, molasses, vanilla, salt, and cinnamon.
Sprinkle crumb mixture over hot crust. Pour in molasses mixture. Bake pie until filling is set in center, about 35 minutes. Transfer pie to rack; cool completely.
Sift powdered sugar over pie. Cut into wedges and serve with ice cream.

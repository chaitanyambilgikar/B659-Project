Shape crab mixture into six 2 1/4-inch-diameter patties, using 1/4 cup mixture for each. Place fritters on baking sheet. Cover and refrigerate at least 3 hours.

Place panko in shallow dish. Cost each fritter with panko, pressing to adhere. Pour oil into heavy large skillet to depth of 1/2 inch and heat to 350°F. Cook fritters in batches until brown and heated through, about 2 minutes per side. Drain fritters on paper towels.
Fan avocado slices and grapefruit and orange segments on plates. Drizzle 1 tablespoon sauce over each plate. Top each with 1 fritter. Sprinkle cilantro and chives over and serve.

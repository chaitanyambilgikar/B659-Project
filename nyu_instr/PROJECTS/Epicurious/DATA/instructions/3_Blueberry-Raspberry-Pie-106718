1. Preheat the oven to 400°F. Prepare the Classic Pie Crust as directed for a 9-inch double-crust pie.
2. Drain the berries and pat dry with paper towels. Toss the berries gently with 1 cup of the sugar, the cornstarch, cinnamon, lemon zest, and vanilla.
3. Line a 9-inch pie plate with one crust and prick all over with a fork. Brush the bottom with the egg white mixture to prevent sogginess. Spoon the berry mixture into the crust.
4. Cover the filling with a top crust. Trim the overhang to 1 inch. With water, moisten the crusts where they meet, then press them together lightly and turn under. Crimp the edges decoratively. Brush the top crust lightly all over with water and sprinkle evenly with the remaining tablespoon of sugar.
5. Bake the pie in the lower third of the oven until the filling is bubbly and the crust is golden brown, 1 to 1 1/4 hours. Let cool on a rack before serving warm or at room temperature.

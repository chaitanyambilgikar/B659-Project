For biscuits: Place flour, crystallized ginger, sugar, baking powder, grated egg yolk, and salt in processor; blend to combine. Add butter and process until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add 2/3 cup cream and process just until moist clumps begin to form. Turn dough out onto floured work surface and knead briefly just until dough comes together, about 4 turns. Divide dough into 8 equal portions. Shape each into 2-inch ball; flatten each to 3/4-inch thickness. DO AHEAD: Biscuits can be made 2 hours ahead. Cover and chill.
For fruit mixture: Combine peaches and blackberries with sugar, crystallized ginger, and cornstarch in large bowl; toss to coat. Let stand until juices begin to form, tossing occasionally, about 30 minutes.
Position rack in center of oven; preheat to 350°F. Butter 2-quart baking dish or 11x7x2-inch glass baking dish. Transfer fruit mixture to prepared dish. Place biscuits atop fruit mixture, spacing slightly apart. Brush biscuits with remaining 1 tablespoon cream; sprinkle with raw sugar.
Bake cobbler until fruit mixture is bubbling thickly and biscuits are light golden, about 50 minutes. Cool cobbler 20 minutes. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream.
* Also called turbinado or demerara sugar; available at most supermarkets and at natural foods stores.

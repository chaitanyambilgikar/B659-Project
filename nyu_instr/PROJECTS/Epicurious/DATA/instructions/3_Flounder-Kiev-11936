In a small bowl whisk together the butter, the garlic paste, the parsley, the thyme, and salt and pepper to taste. Using a sheet of wax paper as a guide roll the butter mixture into a 6-inch-long log and chill it for 1 hour, or until it is firm. Cut the butter mixture into 1-inch pieces, cut each piece in half, and roll each half into a 1-inch-long log. Chill the butter logs for 30 minutes, or until they are firm.
On a work surface season the flounder fillet halves, skinned sides up, with salt and pepper, beginning with the narrow end roll up each fillet half around a butter log, and secure each roll, including the sides, with wooden picks to enclose the butter completely.
Have ready in separate shallow dishes the flour, the eggs beaten with the milk and salt and pepper to taste, and the bread crumbs. Dredge each roll in the flour, shaking off the excess, dip it in the egg mixture, letting the excess drip off, and dredge it in the bread crumbs, making sure the fish roll is coated completely and evenly. Transfer the fish rolls as they are coated to a wax paper-lined baking sheet and chill them, covered, for 1 hour.
In a kettle heat 1 1/2 inches of the oil to 375°F. on a deep-fat thermometer, in it fry the fish rolls in batches, turning them carefully, for 7 to 10 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through and the coating is crisp, and transfer them with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain.

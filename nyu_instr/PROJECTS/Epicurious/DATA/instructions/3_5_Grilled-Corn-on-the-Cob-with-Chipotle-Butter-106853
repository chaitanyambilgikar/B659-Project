Melt butter in small saucepan over medium heat. Add minced chipotles, fresh lime juice, and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Reduce heat to low and cook chipotle butter 1 minute to blend flavors.
Place ears of corn on baking sheet. Brush corn all over with chipotle butter. (Can be prepared 4 hours ahead. Cover corn and refrigerate.)
Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Grill corn until cooked through and blackened in spots, turning frequently, about 6 minutes. Serve corn with lime wedges.
* Chipotle chilies canned in a spicy tomato sauce, sometimes called adobo, are available at Latin American markets, specialty foods stores, and some supermarkets.

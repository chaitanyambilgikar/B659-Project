Combine broth and mushrooms in bowl. Let stand until mushrooms soften, about 20 minutes. Remove mushroom from broth and squeeze dry over bowl with broth; reserve broth. Discard mushroom stems; thinly slice caps. Combine vinegar and cornstarch in small bowl; stir to blend.
Heat oil in large saucepan over high heat. Add ginger; sauté 30 seconds. Pour in reserved broth, leaving behind any sediment. Bring to boil. Add tofu, noodles, soy sauce, red pepper, sugar and mushrooms. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover and simmer 5 minutes. Add cornstarch mixture; stir until slightly thickened, about 1 minute.

Preheat oven to 400°F. Combine graham cracker crumbs, butter and 2 tablespoons sugar and press into 9-inch-diameter pie pan with 1 1/2-inch-high sides. Bake until edges begin to darken, about 8 minutes. Cool completely.
Spoon strawberry ice cream evenly into crust. Freeze 25 minutes. Spread vanilla ice cream over. Cover tightly and freeze until firm, about 1 hour. (Can be prepared 1 week ahead.)
Strain 2 tablespoons juice from strawberries. Stir marshmallows with juice in heavy small saucepan over low heat until melted. Cool completely.
Meanwhile, beat whites in medium bowl to soft peaks. Gradually add 1/4 cup sugar and salt and beat until stiff but not dry. Fold in cooled marshmallows. Spread over ice cream. Cover and freeze until ready to serve. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Refrigerate thawed berries.) Serve pie, topping each piece with spoonful of strawberries.

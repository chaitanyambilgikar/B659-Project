Preheat oven to 425°F.
In a small bowl stir together 3 tablespoons butter, cilantro, zest, cumin, salt, and pepper until combined. Trim necks of poussins flush with bodies if necessary. Rinse birds inside and out and pat dry. Beginning at neck end of each bird, slide fingers between meat and skin to loosen skin (be careful not to tear skin). Divide seasoned butter into 4 portions. Using a teaspoon put 1 portion of butter under skin of each breast half. Spread seasoned butter evenly under skin by pressing outside of skin with fingers. If desired, tie legs of each bird together with kitchen string and secure wings to sides with wooden picks or skewers.
Arrange birds in a flameproof roasting pan just large enough to hold them. Melt remaining tablespoon butter. Brush butter onto birds and season them with salt. Roast birds in upper third of oven 45 minutes, or until an instant-read thermometer inserted in meatiest part of inner thigh registers 170°F.
Transfer birds to a platter and loosely cover with foil to keep warm. Add wine to roasting pan and deglaze over moderate heat, scraping up brown bits. Remove pan from heat and skim fat from sauce.
Serve poussins with sauce.

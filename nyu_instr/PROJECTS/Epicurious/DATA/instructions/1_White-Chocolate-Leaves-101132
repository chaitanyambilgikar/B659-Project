In a metal bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water melt 2 ounces white chocolate. Pat dry 20 pesticide-free non-toxic leaves (such as rose or lemon) and with a pastry brush coat backs of leaves about 1/8 inch thick with chocolate. Chill leaves, chocolate sides up, 30 minutes, or until very firm. Carefully peel off real leaves. Chocolate leaves keep, layered between sheets of wax paper and chilled, 1 week. Recommended for garnish on cakes, berry desserts, and chocolate mousses.

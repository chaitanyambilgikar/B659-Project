Heat the milk in a 2-quart saucepan over medium-low heat just until warm. In a bowl, whisk together the yolks, sugar, and salt until slightly thickened and lighter in color. Slowly pour half of the warm milk into the yolkmixture, whisking continuously. Next, pour the yolk mixture back into the saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens and thickly coats the back of a spoon. Set a bowl over an ice bath, then strain the custard through a fine-mesh sieve set over the bowl. Add the vanilla and stir until cool. Stir in liquor to taste, then refrigerate for about 2 hours, until completely chilled, before serving.

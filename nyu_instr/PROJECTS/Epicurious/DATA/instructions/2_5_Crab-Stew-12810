In a large heavy saucepan combine the oil and the flour and cook the roux over moderately low heat, stirring constantly with a metal spatula, for 8 to 10 minutes, or until it is a deep caramel color. Add the onion and the bell pepper and cook the mixture over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are softened. Add the clam juice, the tomatoes, and 1 cup water, bring the liquid to a boil, and simmer the mixture gently for 15 to 20 minutes, or until it is reduced and thickened. Stir in the crab meat and salt and pepper to taste, simmer the stew for 5 minutes, and stir in the scallion green. Serve the stew over the rice.

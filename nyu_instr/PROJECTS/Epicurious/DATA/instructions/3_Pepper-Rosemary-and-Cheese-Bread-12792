In a large bowl proof the yeast in 1 1/3 cups warm water for 5 minutes, or until the mixture is foamy. Stir in 3 1/2 cups of the flour, the salt, the rosemary, the pepper, the oil, the cheeses, and the bell peppers and stir the mixture until it is combined well. Knead the dough on a floured surface, incorporating as much of the remaining 1 cup flour as necessary to prevent the dough from sticking, for 8 to 10 minutes, or until it is smooth and elastic, transfer it to a lightly oiled bowl, turning it to coat it with the oil, and let it rise, covered with plastic wrap, in a warm place for 1 hour, or until it is double in bulk. Punch down the dough, halve it, and shape each piece into a loaf, about 14 inches long. Transfer the loaves to a lightly oiled baking sheet and let them rise, covered with a kitchen towel, for 45 minutes, or until they are almost double in bulk. Bake the loaves in the middle of a preheated 450°F. oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until they are golden, transfer them to a rack, and let them cool.
To roast peppers: Using a long-handled fork char the peppers over an open flame, turning them, for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the skins are blackened. (Or broil the peppers on the rack of a broiler pan under a preheated broiler about 2 inches from the heat, turning them every 5 minutes, for 15 to 25 minutes, or until the skins are blistered and charred.) Transfer the peppers to a bowl and let them steam, covered, until they are cool enough to handle. Keeping the peppers whole, peel them starting at the blossom end, cut off the tops, and discard the seeds and ribs. (Wear rubber gloves when handling chilies.)

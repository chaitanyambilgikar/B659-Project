Preheat oven to 350°F. Spray two 9x5x3-inch metal loaf pans with nonstick spray.
Using electric mixer, beat sugar and butter in large bowl to blend. Beat in eggs, then chocolate syrup. Beat in flour, baking powder and salt (dough will be soft). Stir in chocolate chips and nuts. Spread half of batter in each prepared pan. Bake until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Turn loaves out onto rack and cool 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 300°F.
Using long serrated knife, cut each warm loaf crosswise into 1/2- to 3/4-inch-thick slices. Arrange slices, cut side down, on 2 baking sheets. Bake 10 minutes. Turn slices over. Bake until just golden, about 10 minutes. Cool biscotti completely. Store airtight at room temperature up to 3 days.

Pound chicken between 2 sheets of plastic wrap to an even 1/2-inch thickness.
Whisk together egg and milk in a shallow bowl. Crush cornflakes into another shallow bowl and toss with 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and pepper.
Heat oil in a small nonstick skillet over medium heat until hot.
Meanwhile, sprinkle chicken with 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and pepper. Dredge in egg mixture, letting excess drip off, then in cornflakes, pressing to help adhere.
Fry chicken, turning once, until golden and just cooked through, 5 to 6 minutes total. Drain on paper towels.
Serve with: smashed potatoes and peas

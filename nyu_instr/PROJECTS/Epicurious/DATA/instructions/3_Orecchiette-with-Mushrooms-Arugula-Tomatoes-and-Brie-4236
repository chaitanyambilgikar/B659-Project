Cook pasta in pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite. Drain, reserving cup cooking liquid.
Meanwhile, heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms and garlic and sauté until mushrooms soften, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes and stir until beginning to soften, about 2 minutes. Add wine; bring sauce to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tomatoes soften and release their juices, about 5 minutes.
Add arugula, cheese and pasta to sauce. Toss until arugula wilts, cheese begins to melt and pasta is heated through, adding reserved cooking liquid by tablespoonfuls if mixture is dry. Season with salt and pepper.

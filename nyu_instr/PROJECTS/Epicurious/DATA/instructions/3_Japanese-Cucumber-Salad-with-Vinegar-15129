If using bonito flakes, in a bowl stir together flakes, vinegar, and soy sauce and let stand 1 hour.
Peel and seed cucumbers and diagonally cut into 1/8- to 1/4-inch-thick slices. In a colander set over a bowl toss cucumbers with salt and drain 30 minutes. Rinse cucumbers well and pat dry. Pour bonito mixture through a fine sieve into a large bowl and toss liquid with cucumbers and 1 tablespoon sugar; if not using bonito flakes, toss cucumbers with vinegar, soy sauce, and 1 tablespoon sugar, or to taste. With scissors cut nori lengthwise into thin strips.
Serve salad garnished with nori strips.

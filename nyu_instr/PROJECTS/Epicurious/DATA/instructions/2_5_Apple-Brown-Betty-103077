Preheat oven to 375°F.
Melt butter in a large nonstick skillet and remove from heat. Stir in cinnamon, salt, and 1 tablespoon brown sugar, then stir in bread crumbs. Sprinkle one third of crumbs over bottom of a 1-quart shallow baking dish. Peel and coarsely chop 2 apples. Cook with water and remaining 2 tablespoons brown sugar in a 1 1/2-quart saucepan, covered, over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, 10 minutes. Purée chopped apples with cooking liquid in a blender.
Peel remaining 2 apples and cut into 1/4-inch-thick wedges. Arrange wedges over crumbs, then pour hot purée over wedges. Sprinkle with remaining crumbs. Bake in middle of oven until top is golden brown and apples are tender, about 40 minutes. Cool on a rack 10 minutes and serve with frozen yogurt.

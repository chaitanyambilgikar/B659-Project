Position rack in top third of oven and preheat to 425°F. Pierce each potato several times with toothpick. Bake on rack until tender, about 1 hour 10 minutes. Transfer potatoes to work surface. Maintain oven temperature.
Cut off top 1/4 of 1 long side of each potato. Scoop potato from skins into large bowl, leaving 1/4-inch-thick shell. Mash potato with milk. Mix in cheese, chips, cilantro and onions. Season with salt and pepper. Fill shells with potato mixture, mounding in center.
Return stuffed potatoes to oven and bake until heated through, about 20 minutes. Top potatoes with salsa and sour cream and serve.

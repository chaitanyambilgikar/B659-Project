Preheat broiler.
Split muffins or halve rolls and spread cut sides with 2 tablespoons butter. On a baking sheet broil muffins or roll halves, cut sides up, about 4 inches from heat until lightly toasted. Divide cheese between bottom halves of muffins or rolls and broil until cheese has just melted.
In a 10-inch non-stick skillet heat 1/2 tablespoon butter over moderate heat until foam subsides and cook bacon, turning once, until heated through and just golden. Arrange bacon on cheese.
In same skillet heat remaining 1/2 tablespoon butter over moderate heat until foam subsides and crack eggs into skillet. Season eggs with salt and pepper and cook 2 minutes, or until whites are set on bottom but still runny on top. With spatula gently turn each over and cook 2 minutes more, or until yolks are just set. With a spatula gently transfer 2 eggs to each bottom half and top with remaining muffin or roll halves.

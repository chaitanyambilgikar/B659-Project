In a skillet, preferably non-stick, heat 1 1/2 tablespoons of the oil over moderately high heat until it is hot but not smoking and in it sauté the swordfish steaks, patted dry, for 4 to 5 minutes on each side, or until they are just cooked through. While the fish is cooking, in a small bowl stir together the olives, the roasted red pepper, the parsley, the capers, the anchovy, the garlic paste, the scallion, the vinegar, the remaining 3 1/2 tablespoons oil, and salt and pepper to taste. Transfer the swordfish to plates, spoon the sauce over it, and serve it with lemon wedges.

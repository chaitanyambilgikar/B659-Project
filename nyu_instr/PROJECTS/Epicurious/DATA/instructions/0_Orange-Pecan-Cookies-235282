Pulse pecans and sugar in a food processor into a sandlike texture. Transfer to a bowl and stir in zest and extract. Slowly stir in egg white until a thin dough forms. Cover and chill at least 2 hours. Heat oven to 350°F. Lightly coat a baking sheet with cooking spray. Measure 16 heaping teaspoonsful of dough and roll each into a ball. Place balls on sheet, 2 inches apart. Bake 8 to 10 minutes. Cool completely before removing from pan. Dust with powdered sugar if desired.

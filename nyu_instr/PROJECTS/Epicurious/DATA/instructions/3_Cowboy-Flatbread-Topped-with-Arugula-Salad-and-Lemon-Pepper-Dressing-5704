Mix first 7 ingredients in bowl. Rub in butter with fingers until mixture resembles coarse meal. Mix in cheeses. Using fork, mix in 2/3 cup water and vinegar until moist dough forms. Cover; chill 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 375°F. Gently knead dough on floured surface until smooth, about 10 turns. Divide into 4 pieces. Roll out each piece to 9-inch round. Spray small ovenproof skillet or 8-inch-diameter cake pan with vegetable oil spray. Place 1 dough round into bottom and 1/2 inch up sides of skillet. Bake until light golden, about 20 minutes. Transfer to large baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough rounds. (Can be made 4 hours ahead. Cover loosely with foil. Rewarm uncovered in 350°F. oven for 5 minutes.) Top with Arugula Salad. Cut into wedges.

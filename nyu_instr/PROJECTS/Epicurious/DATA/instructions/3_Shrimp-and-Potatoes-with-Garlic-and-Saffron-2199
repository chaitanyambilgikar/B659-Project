Add shrimp and hot pepper flakes; increase heat to medium-high and stir to coat shrimp with oil. Add tomato paste and wine mixture. Bring to boil, stirring constantly. Cook until shrimp are just tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer shrimp to bowl, using slotted spoon. Add potatoes to skillet and boil until liquid thickens to sauce consistency, about 6 minutes. Return shrimp and any juices in bowl to skillet. Mix in peas and marjoram and heat through. Season with salt and pepper and serve.

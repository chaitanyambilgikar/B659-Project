Charcoal Grilling Instructions: Open vents on bottom of grill. Light a large chimney starter full of charcoal (preferably hardwood).
For Direct-Heat Grilling: When coals are lit, dump them out across bottom rack, leaving a space free of coals on one side of grill equal to the size of the food to be grilled where food can be moved in case of any flare-ups
For Indirect-Heat Cooking: When coals are lit, dump them out along two opposite sides of bottom rack, leaving a space free of charcoal in middle of rack equal to the size of the food to be grilled.
For Direct-or Indirect Heat: When charcoal turns grayish white (start checking coals after 15 minutes), the grill will be at its hottest and will then begin to cool off. How long you can hold your hand 5 inches above the grill rack directly over the coals determines the heat of your grill, as follows:
Hot: 1 to 2 seconds
Medium Hot: 3 to 4 seconds
Low: 5 to 6 seconds
Gas Grill Instructions: Preheat all burners on high, covered, 10 minutes, then adjust heat according to recipe. For indirect-heat cooking, just before grilling, turn off 1 burner (middle burner if there are 3).

In a saucepan simmer lentils in broth and water, covered 20 minutes, or until tender, and drain. Toss lentils with oil, vinegar, and lemon juice and cool almost to room temperature.
Chop arugula, radicchio, and endive into 1/4-inch pieces and add to lentils. Add feta and salt and coarsely ground black pepper to taste, tossing well.

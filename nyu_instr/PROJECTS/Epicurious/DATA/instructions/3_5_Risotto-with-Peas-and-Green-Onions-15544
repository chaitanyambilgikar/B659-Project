Melt butter in heavy large saucepan over medium heat. Add green onions and thyme and sauté until onions wilt, about 1 minute. Add rice and stir to coat. Add 2 1/2 cups broth and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Mix in peas. Simmer until rice is tender and mixture is creamy, adding more broth by 1/4 cupfuls if risotto is dry and stirring often, about 5 minutes. Mix in 1/3 cup cheese; season with salt and pepper. Serve risotto, passing remaining cheese separately.

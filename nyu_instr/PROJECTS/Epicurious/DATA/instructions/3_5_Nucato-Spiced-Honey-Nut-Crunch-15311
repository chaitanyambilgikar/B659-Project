Gradually bring the honey to the boil, skimming off any impurities that may rise to the surface. Very coarsely chop the nuts and add to the honey along with 1 teaspoon of the spice mixture. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, for 30 to 45 minutes. The mixture is done when you can hear the almonds beginning to "pop" from the heat of the honey. Take care not to let the nuts burn and turn dark and bitter. When done, stir in the remaining spice mixture.
When the nucato is done, pour it out onto a sheet pan or cookie sheet lined with parchment paper; spread it into an even layer with the cut surface of a halved lemon. Cool completely before serving.

Make sandwiches (adding ham and cheese to each split roll). Keep rolls on an aluminum baking sheet.
In a bowl, mix onion flakes, mustard, poppy seeds, and margarine together. Drizzle mixture over sandwiches.
Cover trays with tin foil. Bake at 325°F for 20 minutes. When cheese has melted remove rolls from tray and serve warm.

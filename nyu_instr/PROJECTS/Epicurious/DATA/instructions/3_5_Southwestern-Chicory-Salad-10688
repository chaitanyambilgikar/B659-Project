In a salad bowl stir together oil, vinegar, mustard, and chili powder. With a sharp knife cut a slice from top and bottom of orange to expose flesh and arrange orange with a cut side down on a cutting board. Cutting from top to bottom, remove peel and pith. Cut sections free from membranes. To dressing add orange sections and remaining ingredients and toss to coat.

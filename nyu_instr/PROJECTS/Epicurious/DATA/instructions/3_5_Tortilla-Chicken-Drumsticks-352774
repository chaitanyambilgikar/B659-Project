Preheat oven to 450°F with rack in middle. Oil a large 4-sided sheet pan.
Pulse chips, 2 teaspoons chili powder, cumin, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a food processor until coarsely ground, then transfer to a shallow dish.
Whisk egg and remaining 2 teaspoon chili powder in a bowl.
Season chicken with 1/2 teaspoon salt. Dip drumsticks in egg, letting excess drip off, then coat with crumbs, pressing to help them adhere. Transfer to sheet pan.
Bake, without turning, until cooked through, 40 to 45 minutes. Let stand, uncovered, 5 minutes.

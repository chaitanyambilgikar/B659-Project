Bring stock to a simmer in a 3- to 4-quart saucepan, then stir in chile powder (to taste) and shallots and simmer, uncovered, 2 minutes. Add chicken and simmer until just cooked through, about 2 minutes. Stir in fish sauce (to taste) and soy sauce and simmer 1 minute. Remove from heat and stir in mint.
Serve soup warm, topped with scallions and cilantro.

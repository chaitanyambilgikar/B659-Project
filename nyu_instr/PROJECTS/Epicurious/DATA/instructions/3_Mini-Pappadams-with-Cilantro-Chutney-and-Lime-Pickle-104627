Fry pappadams: Heat oil in a 2-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat until it registers 350°F on deep-fat thermometer. Fry pappadams in 3 batches until puffed and pale golden, 30 seconds to 1 minute, then transfer with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain. (Return oil to 350°F between batches.)
Make chutney: Purée cilantro in a blender with jalapeño, water, brown sugar, lime juice, and salt. Transfer to a bowl and stir in yogurt.
Serve pappadams with chutney and pickle for dipping.

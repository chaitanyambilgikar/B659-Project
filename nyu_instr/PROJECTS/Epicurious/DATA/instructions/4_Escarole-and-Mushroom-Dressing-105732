Preheat oven to 425°F.
Toss mushrooms with garlic and 3 tablespoons oil in a 3- to 4-quart shallow glass or ceramic baking dish and roast in middle of oven, stirring twice, until mushrooms are just tender, about 20 minutes. Cool to room temperature.
While mushrooms are roasting, cook escarole in a large pot of boiling salted water, uncovered, until just tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain in a colander and rinse under cold water to stop cooking. Squeeze gently to remove excess water.
Cook onions in remaining 3 tablespoons oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat, stirring frequently, until softened, 6 to 8 minutes. Stir in 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.
Whisk together eggs, cream, stock, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and pepper in a large bowl, then add mushrooms, escarole, onions, and bread and toss well. Spread in buttered cleaned baking dish and bake, covered with foil, in upper third of oven until heated through, about 20 minutes. Remove foil and bake until edges of bread are crisp, about 10 minutes more.

Cook onions in large pot of boiling salted water 2 minutes to loosen skins. Drain and cool slightly. Cut root ends from onions. Peel onions. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
Combine onions, 1 cup Port, currants, butter, sugar, 1 tablespoon vinegar and 2 teaspoons thyme in heavy large skillet. Cover and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium and cook, covered, 15 minutes. Uncover and cook until onions are almost tender and coated with glaze, stirring frequently, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat. Mix in remaining 1 tablespoon vinegar. Season to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Before serving, rewarm over low heat, adding more Port by tablespoonfuls if mixture is dry.) Sprinkle with remaining 1 teaspoon thyme and serve.

Roll out dough into a 13-inch round on a lightly floured surface with a lightly floured rolling pin. Fit into tart pan and trim edges. Chill shell until firm, about 30 minutes.
Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 375°F.
Lightly prick bottom of shell all over with a fork, then line with foil and fill with pie weights. Bake until side is set and edge is pale golden, about 20 minutes. Carefully remove foil and weights and bake shell until deep golden, 10 to 15 minutes more. Leave oven on.
Whisk together eggs, brown sugar, vanilla, and salt until combined, then whisk in melted butter, nuts, and coconut. Pour filling into tart shell and bake until set in center, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool in pan on a rack 30 minutes, then remove side of pan and cool tart to room temperature, 1 1/2 to 2 hours more.

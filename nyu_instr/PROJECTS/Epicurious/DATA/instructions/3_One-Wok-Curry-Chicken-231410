1. Heat a 14-inch flat-bottomed wok over high heat until a bead of water vaporizes within 1 to 2 seconds of contact. Swirl in the oil and add the chicken pieces skin side down, spreading them in the wok. Cook undisturbed 3 to 4 minutes, adjusting the heat between medium and medium-high as the chicken browns. Then, using a metal spatula, turn the chicken over and pan-fry 3 to 4 minutes or until the chicken is browned on the other side but not cooked through. Remove to a plate, leaving the pan drippings.
2. Add the shallots to the pan drippings, and cook over medium heat 2 to 3 minutes or until just softened. Add the curry paste or powder and cook, stirring, 30 seconds or until fragrant. (With curry paste, the drippings may spatter a little; with curry powder, the ingredients become dry and the pan may begin to smoke.)
3. Return the chicken to the wok and stir until well combined with shallots. Add the coconut milk and broth and bring to a boil over high heat, uncovered. Add the potatoes, bell pepper, salt, and pepper and stir to combine. Cover, reduce the heat to medium-low, and simmer 15 minutes. Turn the chicken and simmer 15 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through and the potatoes are tender.

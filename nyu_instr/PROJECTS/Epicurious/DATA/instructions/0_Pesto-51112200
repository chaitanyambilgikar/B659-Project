1. In a small pot of boiling water, blanch the garlic for 1 minute.
2. In a blender, combine the garlic, basil, Pecorino Romano, Parmigiano-Reggiano, pine nuts, and 3/4 cup oil, and gently blend until a chunky purée forms. (To prevent the pesto from turning brown, don't run the blender on high.) Season to taste with salt, then add more olive oil, if needed, and continue to blend until the mixture is smooth and pourable.

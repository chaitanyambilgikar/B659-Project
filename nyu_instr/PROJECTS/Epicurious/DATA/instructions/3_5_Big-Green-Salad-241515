Tear romaine into bite-size pieces and put in a salad bowl. Halve cucumber lengthwise, then thinly slice diagonally and add to romaine along with celery.
Whisk together remaining ingredients with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a small bowl until emulsified. Add to salad and toss to coat.

Preheat oven to 450°F. and lightly brush 2 shallow baking pans with oil. Cut tomatoes into 1/2-inch-thick slices and arrange in one layer in baking pans. Roast tomatoes in upper and lower thirds of oven until just tender but not falling apart, about 15 minutes, and cool slightly in pans on racks. Leave oven on.
Halve garlic. Cut bread into 1/2-inch-thick slices and with a 4-inch round cutter cut out 4 rounds. Brush rounds on both sides with remaining 1/3 cup oil and arrange in one layer on a baking sheet. Toast rounds in middle of oven until golden brown, about 5 minutes, and immediately rub on both sides with cut sides of garlic. Season toasted rounds with salt and pepper.
Layer 1 slice each of yellow and red tomato in bottom of each of four 4-inch (about 1-cup) ramekins and spread 1 teaspoon pesto evenly over each. Repeat layering once and top each Tatin with a toast round. Bake Tatins in middle of oven just until hot, about 5 minutes. Invert a plate over each ramekin and invert ramekins onto plates.
Serve Tatins immediately.

for crust: Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter 9-inch-diameter glass pie dish. Finely grind cookies in processor. Add melted butter; blend until moist crumbs form. Press crumbs onto bottom and up sides of pie dish. Bake until crust is set, about 12 minutes. Cool on rack.
for filling: Stir chocolate and amaretto in medium metal bowl set over saucepan of simmering water until chocolate is melted and smooth (do not allow bottom of bowl to touch water). Remove bowl from over water. Stir in corn syrup. Cool to room temperature. Beat cream in large bowl to soft peaks. Fold 1/4 of whipped cream into chocolate mixture, then fold in remaining cream. Spoon filling into crust. Freeze until firm, at least 4 hours or overnight.

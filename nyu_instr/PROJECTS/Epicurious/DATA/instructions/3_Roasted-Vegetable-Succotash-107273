Preheat oven to 400°F. Toss first 5 ingredients, 3 tablespoons oil, and garlic on large rimmed baking sheet; spread in single layer. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Roast until vegetables are almost tender, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes. Stir in lima beans; roast until all vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes longer.
Stir breadcrumbs and 2 teaspoons oil in nonstick skillet over medium heat until crisp, about 5 minutes.
Bring half and half to boil in heavy small saucepan. Mix roasted vegetables, hot half and half, parsley, thyme, and oregano in 1 1/2-quart baking dish. Season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle toasted breadcrumbs over and serve.

1. Split the bread lengthwise and pull out some of the insides. Brush the insides of the bread with 2 teaspoons of the olive oil.
2. Make the salad: Toss the arugula and tomato strips in a bowl with the remaining tablespoon of olive oil and the balsamic vinegar. Season with salt and pepper.
3. Layer the bottom of the bread with the mozzarella, basil, prosciutto and salami. Top with the salad. Cover with the top of the bread. Cut the sandwich in half on the diagonal and wrap well for the road.

Make meringue layers: Do not preheat oven. Butter two 10-inch springform pans.
In a large bowl with an electric mixer beat whites with cream of tartar and a pinch salt until they just hold soft peaks. Add granulated sugar a little at a time, beating, and beat meringue until it is very glossy and holds soft peaks. Fold in vanilla and divide meringue between springform pans, smoothing tops. Put pans in upper and lower thirds of oven and set oven to 275°F. Bake meringue layers, switching position of pans halfway through baking, 45 minutes total. Cool meringue layers in pans on racks and carefully remove sides of pans. Meringue will be crisp on the outside and marshmallowy on the inside. Meringue layers may be made 1 day ahead and kept in an airtight container at room temperature.
Make strawberry sauce ( about 1 1/2 hours before serving): Trim strawberries and quarter lengthwise. In a bowl sprinkle strawberries with granulated sugar and toss to coat. With a potato masher gently crush strawberries until they begin to release their juices, being careful not to crush them to a pulp. Let strawberry sauce stand at room temperature until more juices are released, no more than 1 hour (otherwise sauce will be too liquid). In a bowl beat cream with confectioners’ sugar until it just holds stiff peaks and chill while assembling cake. Slightly soften vanilla ice cream. Loosen meringue layers from pan bottoms and put 1 layer on a large cake plate. Working quickly, spread ice cream onto meringue on plate and top with remaining meringue layer. Spread whipped cream decoratively on top of cake and with a slotted spoon transfer 1 spoonful of strawberries from sauce onto center of top of cake.
Garnish outer edge of top of cake with whole strawberries and serve cake immediately with remaining strawberry sauce on the side.

Preheat oven to 425°. Toss frozen berries and cornstarch in large bowl. Let stand until cornstarch dissolves, tossing occasionally, about 20 minutes. Divide berry mixture among six 4 1/2-inch-diameter crème brûlée dishes with 1-inch-high sides. Toss brown sugar, flour, oats, nuts, cinnamon, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in large bowl. Add chilled butter; using fingertips, blend butter into mixture until coarse crumbs form. Divide oat mixture among dishes, sprinkling evenly over berry mixture.
Place dishes on rimmed baking sheet. Bake 10 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350°F and continue baking until crisp topping is golden brown and fruit filling is bubbling at edges, about 30 minutes longer. Cool crisps at least 15 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature topped with scoop of vanilla ice cream.

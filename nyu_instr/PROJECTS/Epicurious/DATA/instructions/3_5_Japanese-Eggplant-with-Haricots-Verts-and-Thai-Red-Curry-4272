Heat oil in wok or heavy large skillet over high heat until hot. Add eggplant strips and toss to coat with oil. Stir-fry until eggplant strips begin to brown, about 2 minutes. Add haricots verts and stir-fry until eggplant strips are tender and haricots verts are crisp-tender, about 1 minute. Add garlic and ginger and stir-fry 10 seconds. Add miso mixture, soy sauce and curry paste and stir until liquids thicken, about 30 seconds. Transfer to bowl and serve.

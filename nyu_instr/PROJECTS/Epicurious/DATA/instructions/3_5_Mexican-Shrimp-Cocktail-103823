Cook shrimp in boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until just cooked through, about 3 minutes. Drain, cool, and then shell, leaving tail shells attached if desired. Chill until cold, at least 15 minutes.
Stir together tomatoes, scallion, garlic, lemon and lime juices, salt, and pepper.
Just before serving, finely dice avocado and stir into tomato salsa. Spoon salsa into 4 serving dishes and arrange shrimp and lime on top.

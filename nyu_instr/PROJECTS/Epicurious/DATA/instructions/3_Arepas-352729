1. Combine the cornmeal and salt in a bowl.
2. Add the broth (or water). Mix until a dough with no lumps forms.
3. When it's cool enough to touch, use your hands to divide it into 8 pieces. Cover them with a damp towel.
4. Heat a lightly greased large griddle. Dip your hands in cold water (to prevent sticking) and roll each dough piece into a ball. Using your fingers, make an indentation in the center of each.
5. Push a teaspoon each of beans and cheese into each ball. Pinch the dough around the filling to enclose it.
6. Flatten each ball to 1 inch thick between your palms.
7. Cook them on the griddle until crisp, about 3 minutes a side.

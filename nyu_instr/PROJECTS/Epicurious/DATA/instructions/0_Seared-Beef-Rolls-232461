Heat oil in a medium nonstick pan over high heat. Season beef with salt and pepper. Sear 2 minutes on each side, cooking to medium-rare. Slice beef against the grain into thin pieces, about 1/8 inch thick, making slices as long as possible. Lay each piece on a flat surface and top with a pinch of each vegetable, apple, cheese, and pea shoots. Roll up beef so bits of apple and vegetables stick out.

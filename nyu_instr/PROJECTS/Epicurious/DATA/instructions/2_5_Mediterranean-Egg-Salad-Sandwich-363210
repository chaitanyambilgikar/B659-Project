Bring a large saucepan three-fourths full of lightly salted water to a boil over high heat. Carefully slip the eggs into the water and cover the pan. Reduce the heat to medium and cook for 7–8 minutes. Do not overcook. Drain the eggs, then immerse in cold water. When cool enough to handle, peel the eggs and chop coarsely. In a bowl, combine the chopped eggs, sun-dried tomatoes, olives, and just enough mayonnaise to bind the ingredients. Season with salt and pepper.
Spread the egg salad on 6 slices of toast, dividing it evenly. Top with a lettuce leaf, close the sandwich with a second slice of toast, and serve.
Sun-dried vs. fresh tomatoes In summer, when ripe tomatoes are abundant, omit the sun-dried tomatoes from the egg salad and add a fresh slice of tomato to each sandwich instead.

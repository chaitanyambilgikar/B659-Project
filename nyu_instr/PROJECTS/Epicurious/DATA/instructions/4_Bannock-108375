Preheat oven to 450°F.
Whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and sugar in a bowl. Blend in shortening with your fingertips or a pastry blender just until mixture resembles coarse meal. Form a well in center and pour in buttermilk, stirring mixture with a fork until dough just comes together. Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead 3 or 4 times, then pat dough into a 1-inch-thick round.
Transfer dough to an ungreased baking sheet and prick top all over with a fork. Bake in middle of oven until golden, 30 to 35 minutes.
Transfer bannock to a rack and cool to warm. Serve warm or at room temperature, cut into wedges.

Preheat oven to 400°F. Sauté bacon in heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat until golden brown, about 6 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to large bowl. Stir in parsnips and 1/4 cup hazelnuts. Arrange mixture in even layer in 2-quart baking dish. Combine whipping cream, broth, salt, and pepper in medium bowl. Pour over parsnip mixture in dish.
Bake gratin 30 minutes. Press down on parsnips with spatula to moisten evenly. Continue baking until parsnips are tender and liquid bubbles thickly, about 35 minutes longer. Let stand 10 minutes. Sprinkle with remaining hazelnuts and sage.

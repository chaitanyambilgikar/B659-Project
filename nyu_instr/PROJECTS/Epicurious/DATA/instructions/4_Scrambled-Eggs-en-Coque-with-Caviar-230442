Holding 1 egg narrow end up, remove top half inch of shell with egg topper or knife and discard. Pour egg into a bowl and reserve shell. Repeat with remaining eggs.
Rinse eggshells gently in water, then submerge in a 2-quart saucepan of water and bring to a boil, covered. Remove from heat, leaving shells in water to keep warm.
While shells come to a boil, add cream to eggs and whisk until well combined.
Melt 4 tablespoons butter in a double boiler or in a metal bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water, then cook egg mixture, gently whisking constantly, until the consistency of pudding (thick enough to mound), 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from heat and whisk in salt, pepper, and remaining tablespoon butter. Transfer to a 2-cup glass measure and keep warm, covered.
Toast bread and cut into long 1/2-inch-thick sticks.
While bread toasts, drain eggshells upside down on paper towels.
Put shells in eggcups, then pour egg mixture into shells, guiding flow with a small spoon. (Alternatively, put shells in an empty egg carton to stabilize while filling, then wipe shells clean before transferring to eggcups.) Spoon some caviar on top of each and serve with toast fingers.

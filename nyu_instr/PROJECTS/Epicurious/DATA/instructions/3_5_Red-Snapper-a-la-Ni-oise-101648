Preheat oven to 400°F. Heat 3 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add fennel; cook until almost tender, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer fennel to bowl (do not clean skillet).
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in same skillet over high heat. Add tomatoes and next 6 ingredients; sauté 2 minutes. Mix in stock.
Spoon half of fennel into 15 x 10 x 2-inch glass baking dish. Top with fish, then remaining fennel. Spoon tomato mixture over. Bake until fish is just opaque in center, about 20 minutes.

In a kettle of boiling water boil the collards for 10 minutes, drain them in a colander set over a large bowl, and return the cooking liquid to the kettle. In a large skillet cook the bacon over moderate heat, stirring, until it is just browned and transfer it with a slotted spoon to a small bowl. Pour off the fat from the skillet and in the skillet cook the garlic, the onion, and the red pepper flakes in half the oil over moderately low heat, stirring, until the onion is softened and the garlic is golden brown. Bring the cooking liquid to a boil, in it boil the fusilli until it is al dente, and drain the fusilli well. To the skillet add the collards, the bacon, the fusilli, the remaining oil, and the vinegar and toss the mixture well. Season the fusilli with salt and pepper, divide among 4 bowls, and sprinkle each serving with some of the Parmesan.

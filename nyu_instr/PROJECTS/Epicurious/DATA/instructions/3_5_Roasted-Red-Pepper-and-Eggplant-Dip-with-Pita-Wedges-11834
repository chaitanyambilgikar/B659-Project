Preheat oven to 400°F.
Coat eggplant and bell peppers lightly with additional oil and arrange in a jelly-roll pan. Roast vegetables, turning once or twice, 30 to 40 minutes, or until eggplant is very soft and bell peppers are charred. Transfer peppers to a metal bowl and let steam, covered tightly with plastic wrap, until cool enough to handle.
Peel and seed bell peppers and pat dry between paper towels. Peel eggplant and put flesh in a food processor. Add bell peppers, remaining 4 tablespoons oil, garlic, lemon juice, jalapeño, and salt and pepper to taste and combine well.
Transfer mixture to a heavy saucepan and simmer, stirring frequently, 15 to 20 minutes, or until thickened and reduced to about 2 cups.
Cool dip and chill, covered, at least 1 day and up to 1 week.
Serve dip with pita wedges.

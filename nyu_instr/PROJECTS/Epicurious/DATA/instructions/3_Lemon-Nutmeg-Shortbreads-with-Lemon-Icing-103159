Preheat oven to 350°F. Combine flour, cornstarch, nutmeg and salt in medium bowl; whisk to blend. Using electric mixer, beat butter, sugar, lemon peel and vanilla in large bowl until light and fluffy. Add dry ingredients and mix until dough begins to come together.
Turn dough out onto sheet of waxed paper. Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk. Cover with second sheet of paper. Roll out dough to 1/4-inch thickness, turning and freeing paper from dough occasionally. Free bottom sheet of paper; remove top sheet. Cut out cookies, using 3-inch cutters. Transfer to 2 ungreased baking sheets, spacing cookies 1/2 inch apart. Gather and reroll scraps; cut out additional cookies. Transfer to sheet.
Bake cookies until firm to touch and just beginning to color, about 15 minutes. Transfer cookies to rack and cool.
Drizzle icing from fork tines onto cookies. (Can be made 1 week ahead. Store airtight in single layer at room temperature.)

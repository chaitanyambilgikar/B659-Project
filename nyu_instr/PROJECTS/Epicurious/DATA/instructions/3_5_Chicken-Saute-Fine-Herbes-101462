Brown the chicken pieces in the butter, turning each piece to color evenly. When pieces are browned, add salt and pepper to taste and 1/2 to 3/4 cup white wine. Cook gently until tender. Five minutes before removing the pan, add three tablespoons finely chopped herbs in any of the following combinations: fresh tarragon and parsley; fresh tarragon, parsley, and chives; parsley and rosemary; parsley and chevril; parsley, chives, and dill. Add a little additional wine if necessary and turn the chicken pieces to bathe them well with the herb mixture. Remove chicken to platter and pour pan juices over it.

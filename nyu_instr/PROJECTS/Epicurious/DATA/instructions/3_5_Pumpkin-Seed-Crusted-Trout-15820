Finely chop cilantro. In a sealable plastic bag lightly crush pumpkin seeds with a rolling pin. In a shallow dish lightly beat eggs. Have flour and pumpkin seeds ready in 2 other separate shallow dishes. With tweezers remove fine bones from fillets and season trout with salt and pepper. Dredge flesh side of 1 fillet in flour, shaking off excess, and dip flesh side in eggs, letting excess drip off. Coat fillet with pumpkin seeds and transfer, seed side up, to a plate. Coat remaining fillets in same manner.
In a 12-inch nonstick skillet heat oil over moderate heat until hot but not smoking and cook fillets, seed sides down, until golden, about 3 minutes. Turn fillets carefully with a spatula and cook over low heat until just cooked through, about 3 minutes more. Transfer fillets with a spatula to a heated platter and keep warm while making sauce.
In a small heavy saucepan boil lime juice and wine until reduced by half, about 2 minutes. Cut butter into pieces and add, 1 piece at a time, whisking until incorporated and sauce is smooth (it should not get hot enough to separate). Remove pan from heat. Add cilantro and season with salt.
Spoon sauce over trout fillets.

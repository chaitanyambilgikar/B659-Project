Prepare grill.
Arrange 12 biscuits on twelve 8-inch square sheets of foil and arrange 3 pieces chocolate in a flat triangle on each. Toast marshmallows over flames until golden and put 1 marshmallow on top of each chocolate triangle. Top marshmallows with remaining biscuits to make sandwiches and wrap in foil.
On a rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals heat s'mores 1 minute each side, or until chocolate is melted.

Combine water and cornmeal in small bowl. Bring broth to boil in heavy large saucepan. Gradually add cornmeal mixture, stirring until well blended. Reduce heat to low and simmer until polenta is very thick, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes. Mix in 1/2 cup cheese, cream and butter. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer polenta to serving bowl. Sprinkle remaining 1/2 cup cheese over.

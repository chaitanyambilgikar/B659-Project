Place the bones in a large stockpot and pour in water to cover. Bring slowly to boiling over medium heat, skimming off any grease that rises to the surface. Simmer 20 minutes, then drain in a colander, discarding the liquid, and rinse the bones under cool water. Wash the stockpot and return the bones to it. Add the carrots, celery, onions, garlic, mushrooms if using, parsley, and bay leaves. Whisk together the red wine and tomato paste in a small bowl and then add to the stockpot. Pour in water to cover the bones and vegetables; bring to simmering over medium heat. Lower the heat to low and simmer gently, uncovered, for 24 hours, skimming off any impurities. Check every so often and add more water as necessary to keep the bones and vegetables covered. Pour the stock through a mesh strainer into a large bowl or food storage container; it will keep in the refrigerator for 1 week or in the freezer for up to 3 months. Discard the bones and vegetables.

Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter 2 large baking sheets. Using electric mixer, beat first 7 ingredients in large bowl until fluffy. Mix flour, oats and baking soda in small bowl. Add to peanut butter mixture; beat to blend. Stir in nuts and chocolate.
For each cookie, drop 1 slightly rounded tablespoon dough onto prepared sheet and top each with second slightly rounded tablespoon dough, pressing slightly. Freeze 10 minutes. Bake until cookies are light golden, about 15 minutes. Transfer to racks; cool.

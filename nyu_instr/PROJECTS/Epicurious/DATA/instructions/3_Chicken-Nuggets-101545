If you don't have bread crumbs on hand (premade, frozen, then thawed), make them by whirring the fresh bread in the food processor. Season with the herbs, if using, and salt and pepper to taste.
Place the chicken breasts on a cutting board, and, with your fingers, pull out the little fillet (the tenderloin) on the underside of each breast. Cut the chicken into strips about 2 inches long and 1/2 inch wide.
Drizzle the vinaigrette over the chicken pieces on the cutting board and rub it into the chicken with your hands to make the crumbs stick to the chicken. Sprinkle the seasoned bread crumbs over the pieces and toss to coat. The coating won't be evenly distributed but it really doesn't matter.
Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add the strips and sauté, without moving them, until the crumbs look golden, about 1 minute. With tongs, turn the pieces over and sauté the second side until golden, about 3 minutes. Reduce the heat to low and continue to sauté, turning the pieces frequently, until the chicken is cooked through, about 10 minutes longer.

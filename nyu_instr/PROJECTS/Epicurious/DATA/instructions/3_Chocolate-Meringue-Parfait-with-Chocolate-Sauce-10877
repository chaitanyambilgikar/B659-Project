Preheat oven to 250°F. and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Trace four 4-inch circles on parchment.
In a metal bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water heat egg whites and sugar, stirring constantly, until sugar is dissolved. In bowl of an electric mixer beat egg mixture to stiff peaks. Gently fold in wafer crumbs.
Transfer meringue to pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch star tip and pipe onto circles, filling them in. Continue piping up outer edge or rounds, forming 3 to 4 rings on top of each other to create a shallow nest or bowl. Bake meringue nests in middle of oven 1 hour and turn off oven. Let meringue nests stand in turned-off oven 1 hour more.
In a small saucepan bring cream to a boil and whisk in chocolate and Grand Marnier, whisking until smooth.
Serve each meringue nest filled with a scoop of ice cream and drizzled with chocolate sauce.

Finely chop garlic cloves in processor. Add 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar and 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard and blend until smooth. With machine running, gradually add olive oil and process until well blended. Season dressing to taste with salt and pepper; set aside.
Combine cabbage, chicken, fennel, radicchio, onion, walnuts, carrot and pear slices in large bowl. Pour enough dressing over salad to coat. Toss well. Working in batches, sauté salad mixture in large skillet over medium heat until salad is warm and cabbage is slightly wilted, about 5 minutes. Divide salad among 4 plates. Sprinkle 1/4 cup cheese over each salad and serve.

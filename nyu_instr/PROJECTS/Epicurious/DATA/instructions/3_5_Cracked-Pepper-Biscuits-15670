Preheat oven to 475°F. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in heavy small skillet over medium heat. Add thyme and cracked black pepper. Sauté until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Transfer thyme mixture to small bowl. Whisk in milk, then egg. Cover and chill until mixture is cold.
Blend flour, baking powder and salt in processor. Add 3/4 cup butter. Using on/off turns, process until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add milk mixture. Using on/off turns, process until moist clumps begin to form. Transfer dough to floured work surface. Knead until dough holds together, about 6 turns. Roll out dough to 1/2-inch thickness. Using 2-inch-diameter biscuit or cookie cutter, cut out biscuits. Reroll dough scraps and cut out additional biscuits, making 16 biscuits total. Transfer biscuits to large baking sheet.
Bake biscuits until golden brown, about 12 minutes. Serve biscuits warm. (Biscuits can be prepared ahead. Cool. Wrap in foil and store at room temperature 8 hours or freeze up to 2 weeks. Rewarm biscuits in 350°F oven just until heated through, about 8 minutes.)

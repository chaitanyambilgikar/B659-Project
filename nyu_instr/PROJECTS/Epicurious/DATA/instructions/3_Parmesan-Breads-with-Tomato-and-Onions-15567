Arrange tomato slices on rack. Sprinkle with salt. Let stand 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions and sauté until very soft, about 15 minutes. Add vinegar and thyme. Sauté until liquid is absorbed, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat.
Preheat oven to 375°F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Place bread dough on lightly floured work surface. Knead cheese and red pepper into dough. Divide dough into 8 equal pieces. Form each piece into ball. Roll out each ball to 3 1/2-inch round. Arrange on prepared baking sheets, spacing evenly. Using spoon, make depression in center of each round. Spoon onion mixture into each depression. Top each with 1 tomato slice; press gently to secure. Bake until breads are golden, about 30 minutes. Transfer to rack and cool completely.

In a heavy saucepan bring the cream to a simmer with the jam, whisking, remove the pan from the heat, and add the chocolates and a pinch of salt. Let the mixture stand for 3 minutes, whisk it until it is smooth, and whisk in the cassis. Strain the sauce through a fine sieve set over a bowl and serve it warm over ice cream.

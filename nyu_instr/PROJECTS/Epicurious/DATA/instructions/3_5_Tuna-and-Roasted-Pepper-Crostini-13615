Preheat oven to 350°F.
On a large baking sheet arrange bread slices in one layer and toast in middle of oven until golden and crisp, about 10 minutes.
Make tuna spread: In a food processor purée spread ingredients until blended well and season with salt and pepper. Toasts, tuna spread, and roasted peppers may be prepared up to this point 3 days ahead, toasts kept in an airtight container at room temperature and tuna spread and roasted peppers chilled, covered, in separate bowls. Bring tuna spread and roasted peppers to room temperature before serving.
Top toasts with tuna spread and roasted pepper strips and sprinkle with capers and pepper to taste.

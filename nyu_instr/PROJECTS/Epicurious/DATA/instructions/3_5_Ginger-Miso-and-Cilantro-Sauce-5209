Heat oil in heavy small saucepan over medium-high heat. Add shallots and ginger and sauté 2 minutes. Add broth, orange juice concentrate and vinegar. Boil until mixture is reduced to 3/4 cup, about 6 minutes. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Return to boil before continuing.) Stir in miso and cilantro. Simmer 1 minute. Season with salt and pepper.

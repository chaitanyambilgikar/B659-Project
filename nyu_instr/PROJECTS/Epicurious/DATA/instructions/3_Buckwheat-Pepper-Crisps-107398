Preheat oven to 350°F.
Whisk together flours, sugar, baking powder, salt, and pepper in a bowl.
Blend butter, egg, and milk in a blender until combined. Add flour mixture and blend just until smooth.
Drop level teaspoons of batter 4 inches apart (about 9 mounds) on a large baking sheet sprayed lightly with cooking spray. Spread each mound into a 3 1/2- to 4-inch round with back of a spoon.
Bake first batch in middle of oven until golden in spots, 8 to 10 minutes. Immediately transfer crisps with a thin metal spatula to a rack to cool. Form more rounds on another sprayed baking sheet while first batch is baking, then continue to make crisps, baking 1 sheet at a time. (Cool baking sheets between batches.)

If your meat grinder comes with a coarse and a fine grind attachment, grind the meat first through the coarser disk. Put all the remaining ingredients in a spice mill or blender and process until ground evenly. Add the ground seasonings to the meat and mix in well. In a frying pan on top of the stove, fry a little piece of the sausage and taste for seasoning. Correct the seasoning to your own taste. If you think the sausage is too fatty, you may add some more lean meat (and it needn't be pork: veal is fine, and oysters are delicious); you may want more hot peppers.
Put the properly seasoned forcemeat through the fine grinder.
If you are stuffing the sausage into casings: Run the mixture through the meat grinder set on the fine setting (and with the sausage stuffer attached and the casings tied at one end and placed over the end of the funnel, ready to be filled). Tie off stuffed sausages into 4-inch links. Cover the sausages and place immediately in the refrigerator.
You can smoke some or all of the sausage — or partially smoke it. And you can freeze the sausage as well.

In a large bowl soak beans in cold water to cover by 2 inches at least 6 hours and up to 1 day. Drain beans. In a 3 x 4-quart saucepan cover beans with cold water by 2 inches and simmer until tender, 1 to 1 1/4 hours. After about 45 minutes, season beans with salt. Drain beans in a colander and transfer to a bowl. Gently stir vinaigrette into warm beans. Beans may be prepared up to this point 1 day ahead and cooled, uncovered, before being chilled, covered.
Thinly slice celery and scallions. Chop parsley and mince garlic. Add celery, scallions, parsley, garlic, chives, and tarragon to beans and stir in lemon juice and salt and pepper to taste. Serve beans warm or at room temperature.

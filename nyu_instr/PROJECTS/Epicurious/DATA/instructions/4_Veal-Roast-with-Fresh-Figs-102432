1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.
2. Heat the olive oil in a heavy-bottomed, oven proof baking dish over medium heat and when the oil is hot but not smoking, brown the veal on all sides. Remove the veal from the pan and add the figs. Cook until they are golden but not too soft, about 5 minutes. Remove the figs and reserve. Add the onions to the pan. Cook, covered, until the onions are tender and golden, stirring occasionally so they don't stick, about 10 minutes. Return the veal roast to the pan with the onions. Season it with salt and pepper, then pour the wine over all. Tuck the bay leaves around the veal, pushing them under the wine, cover, and roast in the oven until the veal is nearly cooked through, about 1 hour. Turning it once during cooking.
3. Remove the veal from the oven. Add the figs to the veal, pushing them gently down under the cooking juices. Cover and return to the oven and bake until the veal is cooked through and figs are tender and melting, an additional 15 minutes.
4. Remove the veal from the oven and transfer the veal to a warmed platter. Place the pan with the cooking juices over medium heat and bring to a boil. Boil gently just until the sauce has thickened enough to lightly coat the back of a spoon, 4 to 5 minutes, making sure that the cooking juices don't evaporate too much and that the figs and onions don't stick to the bottom of the pan.
5. To serve, remove the strings from the veal roast and slice it. Spoon the figs and onions and the cooking juices over it, garnish the platter with parsley and serve immediately.

In a small bowl sprinkle gelatin over whole milk to soften. In a dry heavy saucepan cook sugar over moderately low heat, stirring slowly with a fork (to help sugar melt evenly), until melted and pale golden. Cook caramel, without stirring, swirling pan, until deep golden. Coat bottoms of eight 3/4-cup molds or ramekins with caramel.
In a large saucepan bring coconut milk and cream of coconut just to a boil, stirring. Remove pan from heat and add gelatin mixture, stirring until dissolved. Stir in heavy cream and rum. Cool panna cotta 30 minutes. Stir panna cotta well and divide among molds or ramekins. Cool panna cottas completely. Chill desserts until firm, at least 4 hours, and up to 2 days.
To unmold panna cottas, dip molds or ramekins, 1 at a time, into a bowl of hot water 3 seconds. Run a thin knife around edges of molds or ramekins and invert desserts onto a platter.

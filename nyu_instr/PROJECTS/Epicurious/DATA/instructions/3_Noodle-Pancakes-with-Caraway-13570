In a saucepan of boiling salted water boil the noodles until they are al dente and drain them well. In a bowl toss the noodles with the egg and the caraway seeds until they are coated well. In a small non-stick skillet heat the oil and the butter until the foam subsides, add 1/2 cup of the noodle mixture, and form it into a pancake 4 inches in diameter, tidying the edges with a spatula. Cook the pancake over moderately high heat for 2 minutes, or until the underside is golden, turn it, and cook it for 2 minutes more. Slide the pancake onto a plate and keep it warm. Make pancakes with the remaining noodle mixture in the same manner.

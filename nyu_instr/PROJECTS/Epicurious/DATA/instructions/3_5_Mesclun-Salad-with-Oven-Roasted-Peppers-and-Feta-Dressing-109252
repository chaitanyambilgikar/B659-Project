(Peppers can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.)
Place 6 ounces diced feta, 6 tablespoons cold water, and 1 tablespoon oil in processor; puree until smooth, about 1 minute. Add garlic and blend 2 seconds. Set dressing aside.
Place mesclun in large bowl. Toss with remaining 2 tablespoons oil, then vinegar. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Arrange greens on large platter; top with peppers. Drizzle feta dressing over and sprinkle with 2 ounces crumbled feta. Garnish with olives, if desired.

Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter and flour 9x5x2-inch metal loaf pan. Using electric mixer, beat bread mix and 1/2 cup butter in large bowl until crumbly mixture forms. Transfer 1/2 cup crumb mixture to small bowl; add remaining 2 tablespoons butter and rub in with fingertips until moist clumps form (for streusel).
Stir sour cream and eggs into remaining crumb mixture in large bowl. Mix in cinnamon chips, pecans, cinnamon, and allspice. Pour cake batter into prepared pan. Sprinkle with streusel.
Bake cake until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 1 hour 20 minutes. Turn cake out onto rack. Place streusel side up and cool 20 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.

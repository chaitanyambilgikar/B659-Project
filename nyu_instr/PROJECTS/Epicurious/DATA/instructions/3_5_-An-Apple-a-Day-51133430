For filling: Melt butter in a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Add apples, brown sugar, and ginger. Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean (reserve bean for another use). Cook, stirring often, until apples are just tender, about 5 minutes. Add jam, brandy, and lemon juice. Stir until liquid is reduced by half, about 3 minutes. Divide filling among ramekins. DO AHEAD: Filling can be made 4 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.
For topping: Pulse almonds, flour, and powdered sugar in a food processor until almonds are finely ground. Whisk sugar and ginger in a large bowl. Using an electric mixer, add egg whites one at a time to sugar mixture, beating to blend between additions. With mixer running, gradually beat in hot melted butter. Fold in almond mixture (topping will be thin). DO AHEAD: Topping can be made 1 hour ahead. Let stand at room temperature.
Preheat oven to 350°F. Pour topping over filling in ramekins, dividing equally. Place ramekins on a rimmed baking sheet.
Bake until topping is puffed and tops of cakes are golden brown, 25-30 minutes. Let cool for at least 15 minutes. Serve warm, topped with a small scoop of ice cream.

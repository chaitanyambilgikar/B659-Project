Cook pancetta in a large nonstick skillet over moderate heat, stirring, until crisp, about 4 minutes. Transfer pancetta with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon fat from skillet, reserving remaining fat. Add onions to skillet with salt and pepper to taste and cook over moderate heat, stirring occasionally and adding some of reserved fat if onions are sticking, until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in parsley.
Preheat oven to 400°F.
Divide pitas, cut sides up, between 2 shallow baking pans and brush with oil. Season with salt and pepper and bake in upper and lower thirds of oven until golden and slightly crisp, about 7 minutes.
Remove 1 pan of pitas from oven and set aside. Top remaining pitas with onions (about 1/2 cup each), covering pitas. Form a well (with sides about 1/2 inch high) in center of onions to hold egg. Crack an egg into each and bake in middle of oven until whites are set, about 12 minutes. If desired, reheat plain pita toasts in oven until hot. Top eggs with pancetta and bake until yolks are cooked to desired doneness, about 3 to 5 minutes more. Top eggs with pitas to make sandwiches and cut into wedges if desired.

In a large saucepan of boiling water boil onions until tender, 3 to 4 minutes, and drain in a colander. When onions are just cool enough to handle, peel, leaving root ends intact. While onions are still warm, in a bowl stir together with 1/4 cup marinade. Marinate onions, covered and chilled, stirring occasionally, 1 day.
If desired, shell shrimp (see note, above). In a large heavy-duty sealable plastic bag combine shrimp with 3/4 cup marinade and seal bag, pressing out excess air. Marinate shrimp, chilled, at least 1 hour and up to 4. Prepare grill. Soak skewers in warm water 30 minutes.
Drain shrimp, discarding marinade. In a sieve set over a bowl drain onions and reserve marinade for basting. Thread 3 shrimp and 2 onions, alternating shrimp with onions, onto skewers. Kebabs may be assembled 1 hour ahead and chilled, covered.
Grill kebabs on a lightly oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals, basting with reserved marinade and turning them occasionally, until just cooked through, about 3 minutes on each side. (Alternatively, broil kebabs under a preheated broiler 2 to 3 inches from heat about 2 1/2 minutes on each side.) Drizzle kebabs with remaining 1/4 cup marinade.

Combine wine and shallots in heavy medium saucepan. Boil until mixture is reduced to 1/2 cup, about 20 minutes. Cool completely. Whisk in oil and tarragon. Season with salt and pepper.
Reserve 24 outer leaves of endive. Thinly slice remaining endive crosswise. Combine sliced endive and greens in large bowl. Combine tomatoes, cornichons and radishes in medium bowl. (Can be made 6 hours ahead. Cover greens, tomato mixture and reserved endive separately; chill. Let dressing stand at room temperature.)
Toss greens with half of dressing. Add cheese to tomato mixture; toss with remaining half of dressing. Season salads with salt and pepper.
Mound greens on plates. Top with tomato mixture. Garnish with endive leaves.
*Cornichons are tiny brine-packed French pickles, available at specialty foods stores and some supermarkets.

1. Boil a large pot of salted water.
2. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, mix the flours and salt. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and add the eggs.
3. Whisk them, gradually pulling in flour from the rim, until the mixture comes together into a firm ball of dough.
4. Turn the dough out onto a well-floured surface and work it until smooth.
5. With a well-floured hand, pinch off small fingerfuls of dough, roll them between your thumb and forefinger into balls, and press each in the middle to form an indentation. (Toddler fingers are especially well-suited to this task.)
6. Cook the orecchiette in the boiling water for 1 minute past the point when they rise to the top. Drain and serve.

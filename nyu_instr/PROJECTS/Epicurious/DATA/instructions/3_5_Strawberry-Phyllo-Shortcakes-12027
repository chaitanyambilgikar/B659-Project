Preheat oven to 350°F. and brush a baking sheet with some butter.
On a work surface arrange 1 sheet phyllo with a long side facing you and brush evenly with some remaining butter. On this, layer and brush remaining sheet phyllo in same manner. Cut layered phyllo crosswise into 4 rectangles. Top 2 rectangles with other 2 rectangles and cut each stack into three 4-inch squares (for a total of 6 squares). On baking sheet bake phyllo squares in middle of oven until golden and crisp, about 12 minutes, and cool on a rack.
While squares are baking, in a bowl toss together strawberries, honey, and vodka until combined well.
Assemble shortcakes: Arrange 1 phyllo square on each of 2 plates and top with about one third strawberry mixture. Make 2 more layers with remaining 4 squares and strawberry mixture in same manner and top with whipped cream.

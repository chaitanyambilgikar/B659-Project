Bring a large pot of salted water to the boil. Drop in the tomatoes, cook for 15 seconds, and then transfer them to a large bowl of cool water. Slip off the skins and cut them in half through the middle. Poke out the seeds with your finger, and roughly dice the flesh. Warm a large ceramic or glass mixing bowl by rinsing it with hot water. Toss the tomatoes in the bowl with the olive oil, mixed herbs, parsley, and ricotta cheese.
Bring the large pot of water back to a rolling boil, add the spaghetti, and cook until tender but still firm. Drain and add it immediately to the tomato mixture in the bowl. Sprinkle with the Parmigiano. Toss with tongs or two wooden spoons until the pasta is evenly coated. Add salt and freshly ground pepper to taste. Pass extra Parmigiano cheese at the table.

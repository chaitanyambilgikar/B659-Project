Preheat oven to 350°F. With hands, roll 1 generous tablespoonful of dough for each cookie into 1 1/4-inch-diameter ball. Place cookies on 2 ungreased baking sheets, spacing 2 inches apart. Make depression in center of each cookie with fingertip or handle of wooden spoon. Bake cookies 10 minutes.

Continue baking cookies until light golden brown around edges and on bottom, about 8 minutes longer. Cool on baking sheets 2 minutes. Using metal spatula, transfer cookies to rack and cool completely. (Can be made 3 days ahead. Store between sheets of waxed paper in airtight container at room temperature.)

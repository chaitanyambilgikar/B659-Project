Peel and dry pistachios: Preheat oven to 350°F.
Drop nuts into boiling water and cook 2 minutes. Drain in a colander and transfer to a bowl of ice and water to stop cooking. Drain in colander again. Peel off skins and pat nuts dry, then spread in 1 layer in a shallow baking pan.
Bake in middle of oven until dry and lightly toasted, about 7 minutes, then cool. Coarsely chop 2 tablespoons nuts and leave remaining nuts whole.
Make pistachio cream: Finely grind whole pistachios with 2 tablespoons sugar in a food processor. Add 3 tablespoons milk and process to a paste. Blend in 5 tablespoons milk and transfer pistachio cream to a bowl. Chill, covered, 8 hours.
Make "eggs": Whisk together 2 tablespoons sugar and remaining 3 1/2 cups milk in a deep 12-inch skillet and bring to a bare simmer (milk should steam but not bubble).
While milk is heating, beat whites with lemon juice and a pinch of salt in a large bowl with an electric mixer at medium speed until they just hold soft peaks. Gradually beat in 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar, a little at a time, and beat until meringue just holds stiff peaks.
Using an oval-shaped ice cream scoop or an oval soupspoon, form 8 meringue "eggs," gently dropping them as formed into milk mixture (keep milk at a bare simmer). Poach meringues until set on bottom, about 2 minutes, then carefully turn over and poach until set throughout, about 2 minutes more. Transfer with a slotted spoon to a plastic-wrap-lined shallow baking pan and make 8 more meringues in same manner.
Make custard: Pour poaching liquid through a very fine sieve into a large glass measure. Whisk together yolks, remaining 2 tablespoons sugar, and a pinch of salt in a 2-quart heavy saucepan, then slowly add poaching liquid, whisking constantly. Cook custard over moderately low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until it's thick enough to coat back of spoon and registers 170 to 175°F on an instant-read thermometer (do not boil).
Pour custard into a metal bowl and stir in pistachio cream and almond extract. Set bowl in a larger bowl of ice and cold water and cool custard, stirring occasionally. Pour custard through very fine sieve into another bowl, pressing on and discarding solids.
Assemble dessert: Melt chocolate in a small metal bowl set over a small saucepan of barely simmering water, stirring occasionally, until smooth.
Pour custard into 8 shallow bowls or rimmed plates and arrange meringues on top. Drizzle chocolate over meringues and custard and sprinkle with chopped pistachios.

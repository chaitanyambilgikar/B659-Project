In a non-stick skillet heat the butter over moderately high heat until the foam subsides and in it brown the pork chops, patted dry and seasoned with salt and black pepper. Add the broth and the vinegar, bring the liquid to a boil, and transfer the mixture to a microwave-safe baking dish just large enough to hold the chops in one layer. Sprinkle the chops with the bell peppers and microwave the mixture, covered with microwave-safe plastic wrap, at medium power (50%) for 6 minutes. Stir the cornstarch mixture into the cooking juices and microwave the mixture, covered, at high power (100%) for 1 minute.

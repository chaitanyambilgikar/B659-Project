In a bowl whisk together the mayonnaise, the yogurt, the garlic paste, the basil, the lemon juice to taste, and salt and pepper to taste and stir in the tuna, the olives, the sun-dried tomatoes, and the scallions. Divide the tuna mixture between the bottom halves of the bread, top the sandwiches with the arugula, and cover them with the top halves of the bread, pressing them firmly.

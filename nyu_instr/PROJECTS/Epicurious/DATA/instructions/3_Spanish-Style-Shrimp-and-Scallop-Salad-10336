In a skillet heat 1 tablespoon of oil with the garlic over moderately high heat until it is hot but not smoking and in it sauté the shrimp and the scallops, stirring, for 2 minutes. Stir the tomato, the olives, and the onion and transfer the mixture to a large bowl. In a bowl whisk together the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, 1 tablespoon water, the vinegar, the paprika, the sugar, and salt and pepper to taste. Add the lettuces and the dressing to the shrimp mixture and toss the salad to coat it well with the dressing.

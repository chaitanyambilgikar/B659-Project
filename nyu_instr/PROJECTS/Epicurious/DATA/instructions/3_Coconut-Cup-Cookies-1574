Preheat oven to 375°F. Spray 12-cup muffin pan with vegetable oil spray. Mix coconut, sugar, egg and vanilla in medium bowl. Stir in butter.
Unfold 1 crust on work surface. Using 3-inch-diameter cutter, cut out 12 rounds from crust, patching crust scraps as needed to form 12 rounds. Press rounds gently into prepared muffin cups; bake until light brown, about 10 minutes. Drop about 1/2 teaspoon jam, then 1 scant tablespoon coconut filling into each warm pastry. Bake until filling is brown, about 15 minutes. Cut around cookies to loosen. Using spatula, transfer cookies to rack and cool. Repeat cutting, forming and baking with remaining crust, jam and filling to makes 12 more cookies.

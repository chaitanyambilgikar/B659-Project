1. Preheat the oven to 400°F.
2. Halve the pear half and core; cut crosswise in slices and place in a 6-ounce custard cup. Squeeze the lemon on top, add the sugar, oats, nuts, butter and then cinnamon and bake for 20 minutes, until bubbly and golden and pears are soft.
3. Let cool for 5 minutes and add a dollop of cottage cheese or yogurt.
Good Day Summer Crisp: In late summer, follow the recipe substituting a ripe nectarine, a plum or two, or a juicy pluot (plum and apricot hybrid), pitted and sliced, for the pear.
Good Day Fall Crisp: In autumn, use a small sweet-tart Royal Gala apple, but peel, quarter, and core the apple before slicing. Add dried cranberries, dried sour cherries, or raisins, as desired.

Rinse rice in several changes of cold water in a large bowl until water runs clear. Drain in a large sieve.
Bring water and salt to a boil in a 6-quart heavy pot and parboil rice, uncovered, 5 minutes. Drain in large sieve.
Melt butter in bottom of cleaned pot and spoon rice over it, alternating with sprinklings of dill and pistachios and mounding loosely, ending with rice. Make 5 or 6 holes in rice to bottom of pot with round handle of a wooden spoon, then cover pot with a kitchen towel and a heavy lid. Fold edges of towel up over lid (to keep towel from burning) and cook rice, undisturbed, over moderately low heat until tender and a crust forms on bottom, 30 to 35 minutes.
Spoon loose rice onto a platter and dip bottom of pan in a large bowl of cold water 30 seconds to loosen tah-dig (the rice crust on the bottom). Remove tah-dig with a large spoon and serve in a separate bowl or over loose rice.

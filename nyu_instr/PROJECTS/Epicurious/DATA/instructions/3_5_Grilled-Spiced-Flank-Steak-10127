In a small bowl stir together spices and salt and rub on both sides of steak. In a large sealable plastic bag marinate steak, chilled, at least one hour. Steak may be marinated, chilled, overnight.
Prepare grill.
Grill steak on an oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals 5 minutes on each side for medium-rare meat. (Alternatively, steak may be grilled in a well seasoned ridged grill pan over moderately high heat.) Transfer steak to a cutting board and let stand 10 minutes. Holding a sharp knife at a 45 degree angle, cut steak across grain into very thin slices.

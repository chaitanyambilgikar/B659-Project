Whisk together mustard, salt, shallots, parsley, and 4 1/2 teaspoons vinegar in a large bowl. Add 3 tablespoons oil in a slow stream, whisking until emulsified.
Heat remaining tablespoon oil in a 12-inch skillet over high heat and brown bacon with pepper, stirring, 1 to 2 minutes.
Fill a deep 10-inch skillet with 1 1/2 inches of water and 1 teaspoon vinegar and bring to a simmer. Break 1 egg into a cup, then slide into water. Repeat with remaining 3 eggs, spacing them evenly. Poach at a bare simmer until whites are firm but yolks are still runny, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer eggs to paper towels and season with salt and pepper.
Toss frisée with dressing. Serve topped with bacon and eggs.

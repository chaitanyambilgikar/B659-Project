For filling: Combine all ingredients in heavy large saucepan and bring to boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer until figs are very tender, about 1 hour. Uncover and simmer until liquid reduces slightly, about 8 minutes. Transfer mixture to medium bowl. Cool slightly. Refrigerate until cool, stirring occasionally (mixture will be thick), about 45 minutes. Discard cinnamon sticks. (Filling can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and keep chilled.)
For crust: Preheat oven to 375°F. Mix flour, sugar, fennel seeds, and salt in processor. Add butter and 1 egg. Using on/off turns, process until dough forms. Gather dough into ball; divide in half. Flatten each half into disk. Wrap 1 disk in plastic wrap; refrigerate until cold, at least 30 minutes and up to 1 day. Press remaining dough disk onto bottom and up sides of 10-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom. Pierce bottom all over with fork. Chill until firm, about 10 minutes. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and keep chilled.)
Roll out chilled dough disk on waxed paper to 12-inch round. Transfer dough on waxed paper to rimless baking sheet. Cut dough into twelve 3/4-inch-wide strips. Chill strips while filling tart. Spread filling evenly in crust. Place 6 dough strips atop filling, spacing evenly. Place remaining 6 strips diagonally atop first 6 strips, forming diamond lattice pattern. Press ends of strips against edge of tart pan to trim. Whisk remaining egg in small bowl to blend; brush over lattice.
Bake tart until juices bubble thickly around edges and crust is deep golden, about 55 minutes. Cool on rack 1 hour. Using small knife, gently loosen tart from pan sides. Remove sides. Serve slightly warm or at room temperature with ice cream.

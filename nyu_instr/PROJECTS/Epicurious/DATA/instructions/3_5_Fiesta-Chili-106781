1. Brown the beef, pork and chorizo in a nonstick skillet. Drain off the fat.
2. Heat oil in a heavy pot over low heat; cook onions, garlic, and bell peppers for 15 minutes or until tender. Stir in the next 9 ingredients; cook 2 to 3 minutes to mellow the flavors.
3. Add jalapeños, tomatoes, tomato sauce, beans, and the browned meats. Heat through. Add beer, then simmer 15 minutes, stirring once or twice. Season with salt. Serve with grated cheese, if desired.

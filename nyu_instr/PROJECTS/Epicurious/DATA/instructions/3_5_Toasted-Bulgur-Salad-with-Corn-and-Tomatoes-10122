In a large heavy dry skillet toast bulgur over moderately high heat, stirring occasionally, 5 to 10 minutes, or until it makes popping sounds and is browned lightly. Transfer bulgur to a bowl and cool.
In a saucepan bring water with salt to a boil and stir in toasted bulgur. Reduce heat and simmer bulgur, covered, about 20 minutes, or until water is absorbed. Remove pan from heat and let bulgur stand, covered, 10 minutes. Transfer bulgur to bowl and cool.
While bulgur is cooking, in skillet heat oil over moderate heat until hot but not smoking and cook corn, stirring, 2 to 3 minutes, or until just tender. Cool corn and add to bulgur with tomatoes, scallions, vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste, tossing to combine. Salad may be made 6 hours ahead and chilled, uncovered.
Serve salad at room temperature.

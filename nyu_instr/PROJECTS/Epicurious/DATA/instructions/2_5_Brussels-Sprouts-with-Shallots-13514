In a skillet sauté the shallots in the oil over moderately high heat for 1 to 2 minutes, or until they are softened, and stir in the Brussels sprouts and the water. Cook the mixture, stirring occasionally, for 6 to 8 minutes, or until the sprouts are tender, and stir in the vinegar and salt and pepper to taste.

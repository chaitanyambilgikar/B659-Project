1. Preheat the oven to 375°F.
2. Coat the bottom of a large ovenproof skillet with the olive oil. Add the onions, marjoram, and salt and pepper to taste and sauté over medium heat until the onions are translucent and very aromatic, 5 to 7 minutes.
3. In a bowl combine the eggs, ricotta, and Parmesan and stir until smooth and homogeneous.
4. Add the egg mixture to the sautéed onions and stir to incorporate the onions. Cook the frittata on the stovetop until the eggs start to set, then transfer the skillet to the oven. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until firm.
5. Turn the frittata out of the pan onto a large serving plate. Drizzle with olive oil if desired and serve immediately. Or let cool and serve at room temperature.

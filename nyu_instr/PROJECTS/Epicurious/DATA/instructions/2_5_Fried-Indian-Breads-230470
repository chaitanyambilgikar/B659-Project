Whisk together flours, semolina, celery seeds, and salt in a bowl. Blend in butter with your fingertips until mixture resembles fine meal. Add yogurt and stir until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add water and stir with a fork until mixture forms a dough. (If mixture is dry, knead in additional water, 1 teaspoon at a time.)
Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Form dough into a ball and coat with 1/2 teaspoon vegetable oil. Let dough stand in a sealed plastic bag at room temperature at least 2 hours, or chill up to 2 days.
Evenly divide dough into 18 balls and return them to plastic bag. Roll out 1 ball as evenly as possible (to facilitate even puffing when frying) into a 3 1/2-inch round on a lightly floured surface with a lightly floured rolling pin. Transfer round to a paper towel lightly dusted with flour and cover loosely with another paper towel. Roll out remaining balls of dough in same manner, placing rounds between paper towels.
Heat 1 1/2 inches of oil in a wok or a deep 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until it registers 400°F on thermometer. Fry pooris in batches of 3 or 4, without crowding, turning over once or twice with a slotted spoon, until puffed and golden, about 1 minute total, and transfer to fresh paper towels to drain. Return oil to 400°F between batches. Serve pooris warm.

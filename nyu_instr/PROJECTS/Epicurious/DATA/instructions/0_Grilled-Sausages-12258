Prepare grill.
Grill fresh sausages on an oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals, turning them, 10 to 15 minutes, or until cooked through (170°F. on an instant-read thermometer). Grill smoked sausages on rack, turning them, 5 to 8 minutes, or until heated through.
Serve sausages with ketchup and mustards on bread.
Make the tomato ketchup: In a heavy kettle cook onions, garlic, and tomatoes, covered, over moderately low heat, stirring occasionally, until onions are very soft, about 40 minutes. Force mixture through a food mill fitted with coarse disk into a bowl.
In cleaned kettle stir together purée, sugar, and vinegar and simmer, uncovered, stirring frequently to prevent scorching, until reduced by half, about 20 minutes.
Tie cloves, allspice, cinnamon, and celery seed in a cheesecloth bag and add to tomato mixture with mustard and paprika. Simmer mixture, stirring, until very thick, about 10 minutes. Discard bag and season mixture with Tabasco and salt. Ketchup may be made 10 days ahead and chilled, covered.
Makes about 1 1/2 cups.

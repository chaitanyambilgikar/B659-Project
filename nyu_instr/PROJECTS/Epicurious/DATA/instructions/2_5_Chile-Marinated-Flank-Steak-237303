With a mortar and pestle, or the back of a chef's knife, pound or mash the garlic to a paste.
Pour the olive oil into a blender, add the cilantro, and blend on high speed to purée. Add the garlic, ancho paste, cocoa powder, and lime juice and blend to combine. The marinade will be thick. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Trim any fat from the flank steak and pat dry with paper towels. Place in a baking dish and season lightly on both sides with salt and pepper. Cover one side of the meat with half of the marinade. Flip over and cover the other side with the remaining marinade. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 24 hours.
Thirty minutes before grilling, remove the steak from the refrigerator. Wipe off the excess marinade.
Prepare a fire in a charcoal grill or preheat a gas grill to medium-high.
Sear the meat on both sides, turning once, over medium-high heat. Then move the meat to indirect heat to avoid burning the marinade, and grill, turning once until rare to medium-rare. Transfer to a platter and let rest for 15 minutes.
Thinly slice the meat against the grain. Serve with lime wedges.

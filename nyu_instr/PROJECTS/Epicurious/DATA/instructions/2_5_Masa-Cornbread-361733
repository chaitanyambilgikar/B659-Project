Position rack in center of oven; preheat to 400°F. Spread masa on large rimmed baking sheet. Bake until golden, stirring frequently, about 8 minutes. Transfer masa to medium bowl and cool. Maintain oven temperature.
Coat 13 x 9 x 2-inch metal pan with 2 teaspoons oil. Whisk 1/2 cup oil, buttermilk, and eggs in medium bowl. Whisk cooled masa, cornmeal, and next 4 ingredients in large bowl. Stir buttermilk mixture into cornmeal mixture. Transfer batter to pan.
Bake cornbread until edges are lightly browned and tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 15 minutes. Cool in pan 10 minutes. Turn out onto rack; cool completely. DO AHEAD: If using bread in stuffing, wrap in foil and store at room temperature at least 1 day and up to 2 days.

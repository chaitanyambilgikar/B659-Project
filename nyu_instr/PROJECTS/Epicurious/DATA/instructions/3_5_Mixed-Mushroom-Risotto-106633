Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and garlic and sauté until tender, about 10 minutes. Add all mushrooms; sauté until brown, about 3 minutes. Add rice; stir 3 minutes. Add wine and stir until almost absorbed.
Add stock and bay leaves; simmer uncovered until liquid is almost absorbed, mixture is creamy, and rice is just cooked, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes. Discard bay leaves. Stir in 1 cup Parmesan cheese, herbs, and butter. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Drizzle lightly with truffle oil, if desired. Serve, passing additional Parmesan separately.
* Available at Italian markets, specialty foods stores, and some supermarkets.

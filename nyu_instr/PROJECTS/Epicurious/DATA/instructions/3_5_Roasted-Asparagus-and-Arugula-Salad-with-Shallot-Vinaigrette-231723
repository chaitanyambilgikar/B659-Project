Whisk first 5 ingredients in small bowl to blend. Gradually whisk in oil. Season vinaigrette to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Let stand at room temperature 30 minutes and rewhisk before using.)
Preheat oven to 400°F. Place asparagus spears on rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle 1/4 cup vinaigrette over and turn to coat, then spread in single layer. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Roast asparagus until just crisp-tender, about 12 minutes.
Combine arugula, chives, and asparagus in large bowl. Add remaining vinaigrette and toss to coat. Transfer salad to platter; sprinkle with salt, pepper, and cheese. Serve warm or at room temperature.

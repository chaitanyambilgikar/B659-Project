Preheat oven to 450°F.
Whisk together egg white, buttermilk, flour, salt, and cayenne in a shallow bowl until smooth.
Separate onion slices into rings and pick out the 12 largest, reserving remainder for another use.
Heat 1 teaspoon oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking.
Working in batches of 4, dip rings into batter, letting excess drip off, then cook in skillet until golden brown, about 1 minute on each side. (Use 1 teaspoon oil per batch.) Transfer rings as browned to a lightly oiled shallow (1-inch-deep) baking pan.
Bake rings in middle of oven, turning once, until crisp and deep golden, 12 to 15 minutes total.

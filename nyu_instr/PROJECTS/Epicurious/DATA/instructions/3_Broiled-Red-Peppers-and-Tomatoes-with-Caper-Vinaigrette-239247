Preheat broiler.
Cut each bell pepper lengthwise into 8 wide strips. Transfer to a 1 1/2- to 2-quart shallow metal or ceramic gratin dish and toss with oil.
Broil peppers 4 to 5 inches from heat, turning occasionally, until tender, about 25 minutes.
Meanwhile, cut each tomato into 8 wedges and gently toss with capers, vinegar, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. When peppers are tender, add tomato mixture to gratin dish and continue to broil until tomatoes are warmed and slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.

Make tart shell: Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350°F. Blend graham crackers, peanuts, and allspice in a food processor until nuts are coarsely ground. Transfer to a bowl, then add butter, stirring until crumbs are thoroughly moistened. Firmly press crumbs evenly over bottom and up sides of tart pan.
Bake shell until firm, about 10 minutes. Cool completely in pan on a rack.
Make filling: Beat together cream cheese, peanut butter, and butter in a bowl with an electric mixer at medium-high speed until fluffy, about 1 minute. Add brown sugar and beat until incorporated. Beat cream with vanilla in another bowl until it holds soft peaks, then fold into peanut butter mixture gently but thoroughly.
Assemble tart: Spread 1/3 cup jam onto bottom of tart shell with offset spatula. Spread peanut butter mixture on top with cleaned offset spatula. Chill tart, loosely covered with plastic wrap, until firm, at least 3 hours.
Just before serving, stir grapes with remaining 1/2 cup jam with a rubber spatula until coated. Spoon over tart.

Add corn to a 6- to 8-quart pot of boiling water. Return water to boiling, then cover and remove from heat. Let stand 10 minutes. Transfer corn with tongs to paper towels to drain.
Stir together mayonnaise and chiles in a small bowl.
Heat skillet over moderately high heat until hot, then roast corn in 2 batches, turning occasionally with tongs, until blackened in spots, about 5 minutes per batch. Cut corn crosswise into 2-inch sections with a sharp knife and serve with mayonnaise and lime wedges.

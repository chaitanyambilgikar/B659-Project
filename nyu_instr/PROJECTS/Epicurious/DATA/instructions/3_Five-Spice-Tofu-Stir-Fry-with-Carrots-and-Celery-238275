Heat 14-inch-diameter flat-bottomed wok or heavy 12-inch-diameter skillet over high heat until drop of water added to wok evaporates on contact. Add 1 tablespoon peanut oil and swirl, then add tofu and stir-fry until tofu just begins to brown, about 1 minute. Transfer tofu to plate. Add remaining 1 tablespoon peanut oil to same wok (do not clean). Add carrots, celery, and Szechuan preserved vegetable and stir-fry until carrots are crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Return tofu to wok; add rice wine, salt, sugar, and white pepper. Stir-fry to blend, about 1 minute. Remove pan from heat; stir in sesame oil and serve.

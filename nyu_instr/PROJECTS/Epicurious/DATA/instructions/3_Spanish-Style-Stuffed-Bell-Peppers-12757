Halve 3 of the whole bell peppers lengthwise, leaving the stem ends intact, core and seed them, and in a large saucepan of boiling salted water blanch them for 3 minutes, or until they are just tender. Remove the peppers and invert them on paper towels to drain (they will soften while they stand.)
In a heavy 11- to 12-inch skillet heat the oil over moderately high heat until it is hot but not smoking and in it sauté the onion, the remaining whole bell pepper, chopped, the tomato, and the garlic over moderate heat, stirring, for 15 minutes. Stir in the rice and cook the mixture, stirring, for 1 minute. Stir in the broth, heated, and salt and pepper to taste, bring the liquid to a boil, and simmer the mixture, uncovered, for 20 minutes, or until the rice is barely tender. Stir in the almonds, the peas, the minced bell pepper, the zucchini, and the cumin and divide the mixture among the bell pepper shells, mounding it. Bake the stuffed peppers in an oiled baking dish, covered, in a preheated 325°F. oven for 15 minutes, or until the rice is tender, and serve them with the lemon wedges.

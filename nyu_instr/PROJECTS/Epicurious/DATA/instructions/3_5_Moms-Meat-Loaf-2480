Preheat oven to 350°F. With hands, thoroughly mix ground beef, ground pork, onion, catsup, breadcrumbs, eggs, Worcestershire sauce, oregano, basil, garlic powder, salt and pepper in large bowl. Pack mixture into 9x5x3-inch loaf pan. Bake until meat loaf is firm to touch in center, golden brown on top and has pulled away from sides of pan, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Transfer to platter. Cut crosswise into slices.

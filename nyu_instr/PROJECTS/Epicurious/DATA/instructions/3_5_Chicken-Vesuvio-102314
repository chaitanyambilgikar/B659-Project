Preheat oven to 450°F. Sprinkle chicken pieces generously with salt and pepper. Sprinkle oregano and garlic powder over chicken; set aside. Heat oil in large ovenproof pot over high heat. Add potatoes and sauté until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Transfer potatoes to bowl.
Add chicken to same pot and sauté until golden brown on all sides, about 10 minutes. Add garlic cloves and dried crushed red pepper and sauté 2 minutes. Return potatoes to pot. Remove pot from heat. Add stock. Return to medium-high heat and bring to boil.
Cover pot tightly; transfer to oven and bake until chicken is cooked through, about 30 minutes. Add peas to pot; cover and bake 5 minutes longer. Transfer chicken to platter. Arrange potatoes and peas around chicken. Pour sauce from pot over chicken. Garnish with chopped parsley, if desired, and serve.

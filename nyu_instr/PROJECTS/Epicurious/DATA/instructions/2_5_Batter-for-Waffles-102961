1. Whisk the egg yolks and the sugar (if using) then whisk in the milk and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Whisk in the flour quickly to make a smooth batter, then quickly whisk in the melted butter. Whisk the egg whites with a pinch of salt to soft points, and fold them into the batter.
Let the batter sit for 1 hour, then make the waffles following the waffle iron manufacturer's directions. The batter will keep very well overnight.

Bring 1 tablespoon water to boil in small saucepan. Add saffron. Remove from heat. Cover and let steep 15 minutes. Mix in paprika, then mayonnaise, olive oil, lemon juice, and garlic. (Aioli can be made 2 days ahead. Cover; chill.)
Place potatoes in pot with enough cold salted water to cover. Bring to boil and cook until just tender, about 25 minutes. Drain. Cool slightly. Press gently on potatoes to split skins and crack open. Sprinkle with fleur de sel.
Place 2 potatoes on each of 6 plates. Drizzle with saffron aioli; sprinkle with cilantro and serve.
*Smoked hot paprika from Spain, called pimentón de la Vera, is available at some specialty foods stores and by mail order from Tienda.com.

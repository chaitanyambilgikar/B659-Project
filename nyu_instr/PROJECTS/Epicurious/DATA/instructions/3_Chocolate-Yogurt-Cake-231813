Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350°F. Generously butter pan, then dust with cocoa powder, knocking out excess.
Whisk together flour, 2/3 cup cocoa, baking powder, salt, and baking soda in a bowl. Whisk yogurt with water and vanilla in another bowl. Beat 3/4 stick butter with sugar in a large bowl using an electric mixer at medium speed until light and fluffy. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating after each addition. Reduce speed to low and add half of flour mixture. Add yogurt mixture, then remaining flour mixture, mixing until just combined.
Transfer batter to pan and bake until a skewer inserted into center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool in pan on a rack 15 minutes, then turn out onto rack to cool completely.

Season steaks with salt and generous amount of cracked pepper. Melt butter in heavy large skillet over high heat. Add steaks and cook to desired degree of doneness, about 4 minutes per side for rare. Transfer steaks to plate. Tent with foil to keep warm. Remove skillet from heat. Add brandy to skillet and ignite with match. Return skillet to heat and bring brandy to boil, scraping up any browned bits. Add cream and green peppercorns and boil until reduced to sauce consistency, about 2 minutes. Whisk in mustard. Season sauce with salt if necessary. Pour sauce over steaks and serve immediately.

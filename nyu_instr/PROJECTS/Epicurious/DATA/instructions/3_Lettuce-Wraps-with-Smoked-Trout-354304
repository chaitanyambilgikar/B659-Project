Using vegetable peeler, shave carrots and cucumber lengthwise into ribbons. Cut ribbons into 3-inch-long sections, then cut sections into matchstick-size strips. Place in large bowl. Add shallots, jalapeños, lime juice, sugar, and fish sauce; let marinate 30 minutes at room temperature.
Add trout pieces and tomatoes to vegetable mixture and toss to blend. Transfer trout-vegetable mixture to large strainer and drain off liquid. Return trout-vegetable mixture to same bowl; add mint and basil and toss to blend.
Arrange lettuce leaves on large platter. Divide trout-vegetable salad among lettuce leaves. Drizzle sweet chili sauce over each salad and sprinkle with peanuts.

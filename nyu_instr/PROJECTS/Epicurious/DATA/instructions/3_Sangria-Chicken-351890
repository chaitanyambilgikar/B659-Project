Preheat oven to 450°F with rack in middle.
Toss chicken with oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a large bowl. Arrange chicken, skin side up, in a 4-sided sheet pan and roast until pale golden, about 20 minutes. Pour off juices.
Meanwhile, briskly simmer wine and marmalade in a 12-inch heavy skillet, stirring occasionally, until reduced to about 1 cup, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in lemon juice to taste.
Coat chicken with about 3/4 cup glaze and scatter grapes around it. Roast 10 minutes more. Coat with remaining glaze and roast until chicken is just cooked through, about 10 minutes more.

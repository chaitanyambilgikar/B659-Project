Melt butter in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat. Add capers and garlic and sauté until garlic begins to color, about 1 minute. Add white wine and simmer until reduced by half, about 1 minute. Add whipping cream and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until sauce thickens enough to coat back of spoon, about 10 minutes. Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Rewarm before using.)
Bring half and half, 1/2 cup water, and salt to boil in heavy large saucepan. Gradually whisk in instant grits. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and cook until mixture thickens, stirring occasionally, about 6 minutes. Add Monterey Jack cheese and stir until melted and smooth. Season grits to taste with salt and pepper. Remove from heat. Cover to keep warm.
Meanwhile, brush salmon with oil, then sprinkle with salt and pepper. Heat heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add salmon and cook until opaque in center, about 4 minutes per side.
Place spoonful of grits in center of each of 4 shallow bowls. Spoon sauce around grits. Top grits and sauce with salmon and serve.

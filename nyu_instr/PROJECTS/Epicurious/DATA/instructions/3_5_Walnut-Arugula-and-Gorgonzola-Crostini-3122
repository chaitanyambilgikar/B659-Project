Preheat oven to 400°F. Spread butter over 1 side of each baguette slice. Arrange baguette slices on baking sheet, butter side up. Bake baguette slices until golden, about 12 minutes. Cool.
Reduce oven temperature to 350°F. Mix walnuts, Gorgonzola and arugula in medium bowl. Spoon nut-cheese mixture evenly atop baguette toasts, pressing to adhere. Season toasts with pepper. Bake toasts just until cheese melts, about 6 minutes. Cool crostini slightly. Arrange crostini on platter. Garnish platter with arugula leaves and serve.

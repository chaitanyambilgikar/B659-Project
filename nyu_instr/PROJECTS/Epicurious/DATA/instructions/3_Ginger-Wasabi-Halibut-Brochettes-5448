Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Stir mustard and wasabi in medium bowl to blend. Mix in chives, Sherry and ginger. Add fish; stir gently to coat. Let stand at room temperature 15 minutes.
Brush grill rack with oil. Thread fish on skewers alternately with bell pepper squares. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill until fish is just opaque in center and peppers are slightly charred, turning occasionally, about 8 minutes.

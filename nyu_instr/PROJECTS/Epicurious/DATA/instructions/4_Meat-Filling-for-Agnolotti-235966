Put oven racks in upper and lower thirds of oven and preheat oven to 450°F.
Put meats, carrot, onion, celery, rosemary, and garlic in a large bowl and toss with salt and 1/4 cup olive oil, then divide mixture between 2 large (17- by 12-inch) flameproof (heavy) shallow baking pans and spread out evenly. Roast, turning meat occasionally and switching position of pans halfway through roasting, until meat is browned, about 30 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 375°F and roast, stirring occasionally, until meat is tender, about 1 hour more.
While meat roasts, bring rice, 1 cup water, and a pinch of salt to a boil in a 1 1/2- to 2-quart heavy saucepan, then reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, until rice is al dente, about 15 minutes. Transfer rice to a sieve and rinse under cold water, then set aside.
Heat remaining 1/4 cup oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat until hot but not smoking, then stir in cabbage and a pinch of salt. Add remaining 3/4 cup water and cover skillet, then cook, stirring occasionally, until water is evaporated and cabbage is tender, 20 to 30 minutes. Stir in butter and cool, uncovered.
Transfer meat and roasted vegetables with a slotted spoon to a clean large bowl, then skim off and discard fat from pan juices and straddle 1 pan across 2 burners. Add 1/4 cup wine and deglaze by boiling over low heat, scraping up any brown bits, 1 minute. Pour wine mixture carefully into a heatproof bowl. Repeat with second pan and remaining 1/4 cup wine, transferring liquid to bowl.
When cool enough to handle, discard bones and vegetables, leaving only meat in large bowl. Add wine mixture, then stir in cooked rice and cabbage. Grind mixture in meat grinder (filling will be dense).

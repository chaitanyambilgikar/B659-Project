Preheat broiler.
In a large bowl stir together yogurt, 1 1/2 teaspoons mustard, and garlic paste.
Cut off chicken wing tips, reserving them for another use (such as making stock). Add wings to yogurt mixture, stirring to coat well, and marinate 10 minutes.
In a small ramekin stir together bread crumbs, mustard seeds, and salt and pepper to taste.
Arrange wings, skin sides down, on oiled rack of broiler pan and season with salt and pepper. Broil wings 3 to 4 inches from heat until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Turn wings skin sides up and season with salt and pepper. Broil wings 5 minutes more. Spread skin sides with remaining 2 tablespoons mustard and sprinkle with bread crumb mixture. Drizzle oil over each wing and broil wings until crisp and golden, 3 to 5 minutes.
Serve wings hot or room temperature.

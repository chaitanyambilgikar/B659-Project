Fill a 5-quart kettle three fourths full with water and bring to a boil. Have ready a bowl of ice and cold water. Cook frozen edamame in boiling water until bright green, 2 to 3 minutes, and transfer with a slotted spoon to ice water to stop cooking. Drain edamame well and trim stem ends of pods for easier eating. Edamame may be prepared 4 hours ahead and kept in a bowl, covered with a damp paper towel and plastic wrap, at cool room temperature.
Just before serving, toss edamame with salt to taste.

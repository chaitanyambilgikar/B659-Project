In a bowl combine the bulgur with the salt, pour enough boiling water over the bulgur to cover it by 1 inch, and let the bulgur soak for 1 hour. Drain the bulgur and squeeze it dry in a kitchen towel. In a bowl stir together the bulgur, the lemon juice, the oil, and the garlic and let the bulgur marinate, covered and chilled, for at least 1 hour and up to 3 hours. With a melon-ball cutter scoop out the zucchini flesh, reserving it for another use and leaving 1/4-inch shells. On a steamer rack set over boiling water steam the zucchini shells, cut sides up and covered partially, in batches for 3 to 5 minutes, or until they are just tender. Transfer the shells, cut sides down, to paper towels to drain and let them cool. Stir the minced mint, the parsley, the cucumber, the scallion, the tomato, and salt and pepper to taste into the bulgur mixture, divide the tabbouleh among the zucchini shells, and garnish the zucchini boats with the mint sprigs.

Toss together cabbage, carrots, scallions, and salt in a large bowl and let stand until cabbage is slightly wilted, about 5 minutes.
Bring vinegar, sugar, ginger, and red pepper flakes to a boil in a very small saucepan, stirring until sugar is dissolved, then pour over cabbage mixture and toss to coat.

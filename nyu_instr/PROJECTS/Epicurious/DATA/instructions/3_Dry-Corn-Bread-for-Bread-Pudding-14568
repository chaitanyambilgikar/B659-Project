Preheat oven to 425°F and grease an 8-inch square baking pan.
Melt butter and cool. Into a bowl sift together cornmeal, flour, baking powder, and salt. In a small bowl whisk together butter, milk, and egg, and stir into cornmeal mixture until just combined.
Pour batter into baking pan and bake in middle of oven until pale golden and a tester comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Cool corn bread in pan on a rack 5 minutes. Invert corn bread onto rack and cool completely.

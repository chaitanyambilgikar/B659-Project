Cut zucchini lengthwise into 1/8-inch-thick slices using slicer. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then sauté garlic, stirring, until golden, about 2 minutes. Remove garlic with a slotted spoon and discard.
Add half of zucchini to garlic oil and sauté, turning and stirring frequently, until just tender but not golden, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper. Transfer to a platter using tongs.
Heat remaining tablespoon oil, then sauté and season remaining zucchini in same manner and transfer to platter. Sprinkle zucchini with zest and toss gently using tongs.

Preheat oven to 325°F. Chill large metal mixing bowl in freezer. Butter 9- by 13-inch baking dish and dust with semolina flour.
In heavy large saucepan over moderately high heat, combine milk, orange zest, and lemon zest. Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean. Bring to boil, then immediately reduce heat to low and add semolina flour in slow, steady stream, whisking constantly. Cook, still whisking constantly, until mixture thickens, about 1 minute. Add egg yolks and butter, and continue whisking until butter melts and is completely incorporated, about 2 minutes. Transfer mixture to large bowl and set aside.
Using electric mixer fitted with whisk attachment, in chilled large metal bowl, beat egg whites until soft peaks just begin to form, about 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Add sugar and beat until soft peaks fully form, about 30 seconds. Fold 1/3 of egg whites into semolina batter to lighten, then gently fold in remaining whites just until incorporated. Pour batter into prepared pan and smooth top.
Bake pudding until fully set in middle and golden on top, with edges just beginning to brown, about 35 to 45 minutes. Transfer to rack and cool to room temperature before serving. To serve, cut into 8 portions and top with strawberries.

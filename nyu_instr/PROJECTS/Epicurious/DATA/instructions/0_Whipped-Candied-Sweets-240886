1. Mix the syrup ingredients in a small pot; swirl over low heat until combined, about 5 minutes.
2. Place the sweet potatoes in a large pot. Cover with cold, salted water; bring to a boil, reduce heat to a simmer and cook the potatoes until very tender, 15 minutes. Drain. Place in a large bowl.
3. Mash the potatoes with a fork or potato masher until smooth, drizzling the syrup all over. Season with salt. Serve hot. (Or cover and reheat later in a preheated 350°F oven for 15 to 20 minutes.)

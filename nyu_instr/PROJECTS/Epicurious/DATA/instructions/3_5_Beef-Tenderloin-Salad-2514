Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Season steaks with pepper. Add to skillet and cook to desired doneness, about 5 minutes per side for medium-rare. Transfer steaks to platter. Let stand until cool, about 15 minutes. Cover and refrigerate until well chilled.
For dressing: Whisk all ingredients in medium bowl to blend. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
For salad: Cook green beans in large saucepan of boiling salted water until just crisp-tender. Drain. Refresh under cold water. Drain well. Pat dry. Combine green beans and remaining ingredients in large bowl. Cut steaks diagonally into thin slices. Add to salad. Add dressing and toss to coat; serve.

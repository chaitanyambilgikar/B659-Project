Discard tough ends from yau choy, then chop stems into 1-inch pieces and coarsely chop leaves. Cook stems in a 6- to 8-quart pot of boiling salted water until just tender, about 4 minutes. Stir in leaves and cook 1 minute. Transfer yau choy with a slotted spoon to a colander (keep water simmering for pasta), then rinse under cold water to stop cooking and drain again. Do not squeeze out excess water.

While onion and garlic are cooking, bring pot of simmering water to a boil. Add pasta and cook until al dente. Reserve 1 cup of pasta cooking water, then drain pasta in colander.

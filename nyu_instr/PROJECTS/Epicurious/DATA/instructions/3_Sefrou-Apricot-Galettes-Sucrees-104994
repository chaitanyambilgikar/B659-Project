1. Preheat the oven to 350° and grease a cookie sheet.
2. In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat 3 of the eggs with the sugar. Add the oil, flour, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon, then fold in the chopped nuts and fruit.
3. Turn the dough out onto a floured board. Divide the dough into 2 pieces and form each piece into a roll about 14 inches long and 1 1/2 to 2 inches wide. Place the rolls on the cookie sheet, leaving an inch between them.
4. Beat the remaining egg and brush it over the dough. Sprinkle with sesame seeds.
5. Bake for 20 minutes on the middle rack. Let the rolls cool for 5 minutes. Using a serrated knife, slice each roll into 3/4-inch pieces. Lace the slices, cut side up, on the cookie sheet and return them to the oven for 15 more minutes, or until the cookies are golden brown.

Preheat broiler. Combine lamb with green onion, mint and garlic in small bowl. Season with salt and pepper; mix well. Form lamb mixture into two 1-inch-thick patties. Season patties with salt and pepper. Broil patties until brown, about 4 minutes. Turn patties and broil second sides until brown on top but still pink in center, about 4 minutes. Spread 1 1/2 teaspoons chutney over each. Continue broiling until chutney bubbles slightly, about 1 minute longer. Transfer patties to plates.

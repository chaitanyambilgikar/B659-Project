In a small bowl mash together the Saga Blue, the butter, the lemon juice, the parsley, and salt and pepper to taste until the mixture is smooth. Transfer the mixture to a sheet of wax paper, roll it into a log, and chill it for 15 minutes.
In a skillet, preferably cast-iron, heat the oil over moderately high heat until it is hot but not smoking, in it sauté the chops, patted dry and seasoned with salt and pepper, for 5 to 6 minutes on each side for barely pink meat, and top each chop with half the Saga Blue butter.

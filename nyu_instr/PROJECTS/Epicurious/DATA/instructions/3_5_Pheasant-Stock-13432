Preheat oven to 450° F.
With poultry or kitchen shears cut backbone away from breastbone of each pheasant carcass and break each backbone into 2 pieces. In a flameproof roasting pan arrange carcasses, drumsticks, feet, wings, and skin in one layer and roast in middle of oven, stirring once or twice, 30 minutes. Stir in vegetables and roast until bones and vegetables are browned well, 30 to 45 minutes.
With a slotted spoon transfer mixture to a stockpot or kettle (at least 6-quart capacity) and pour off any fat from roasting pan. Add 2 cups water to roasting pan and deglaze pan over high heat, scraping up brown bits. Transfer deglazing liquid to stockpot or kettle and add 10 cups water. Bring mixture to a boil, skimming froth.

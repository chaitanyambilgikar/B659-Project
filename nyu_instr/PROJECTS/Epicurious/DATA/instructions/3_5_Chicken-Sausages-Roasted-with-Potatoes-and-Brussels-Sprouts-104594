Preheat oven to 450°F. Arrange sausages in single layer at 1 end of large roasting pan. Arrange potatoes at other end of pan. Drizzle 3 tablespoons oil over sausages and potatoes; turn to coat. Sprinkle potatoes with salt and pepper. Roast until sausages are brown and potatoes are beginning to soften, stirring occasionally, about 35 minutes. Transfer sausages to plate and reserve.
Add brussels sprouts, bell peppers and remaining 1 tablespoon oil to pan; toss to blend. Roast until vegetables are tender and brown around edges, stirring occasionally, about 35 minutes longer. Return sausages to pan; roast until heated through, about 15 minutes. Transfer sausages and vegetables to platter. Sprinkle with thyme and lemon peel; season with salt and pepper and serve.

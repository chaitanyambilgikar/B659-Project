Pick over and rinse:
2 cups black beans
Drain the beans and transfer to a soup pot.
Add:
4 cups water
Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer, partially covered, stirring occasionally, for 1 1/2 hours. Meanwhile, bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil. Pierce in several places with a fork:
8 ounces hot Italian sausage (optional)
Add to the pot and boil until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the center of a sausage registers 160°F, about 45 minutes. Drain, rinse with cold water, and slice into 1/4-inch thick rounds. Set aside. Heat in a medium skillet over medium-low heat:
1/4 cup olive oil
Add:
1 onion, chopped
1 green bell pepper, chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced
Cook until the vegetables are tender but not brown, 7 to 10 minutes.
Add:
1 teaspoon ground cumin
3/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
3/4 teaspoon ground cardamom
Stir and cook for 1 minute, remove from the heat, and add to the beans after they have cooked for 1 1/2 hours. Cook until the beans are very tender, about 30 minutes more.
Add:
3/4 cup orange juice
1/4 cup dry sherry
1 to 2 teaspoons salt, or to taste
Cook for 15 minutes more, or longer if desired.
Garnish with:
Sour cream

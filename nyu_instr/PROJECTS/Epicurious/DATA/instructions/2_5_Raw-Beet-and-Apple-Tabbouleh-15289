In a large bowl stir together bulgur and boiling-hot water. Let mixture stand, covered, 30 minutes.
While bulgur is standing, trim beets (reserve greens for another use) and peel. Using a mandoline or very sharp knife separately cut beets and apple into 1/8-inch-thick slices. Separately cut beet and apple slices into 1-inch-long julienne strips. In a blender or food processor puree basil with oil, lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste until smooth.
Fluff bulgur with a fork. Add beets, apple, and about 1/4 cup dressing, tossing to combine.
Serve tabbouleh with remaining dressing on the side.

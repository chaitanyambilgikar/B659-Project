Crack chicken wing bones in several places with back of a cleaver or large heavy knife on a cutting board. Bring chicken and remaining ingredients to a boil in an 8- to 10-quart pot, skimming froth as necessary, then reduce heat and gently simmer, partially covered, 3 hours.
Remove from heat and cool to room temperature, uncovered, about 1 hour. Pour stock through a large sieve lined with a triple layer of cheesecloth into a large bowl, discarding solids. Measure stock: If there is more than 10 cups, boil in cleaned pot until reduced, then cool to room temperature, uncovered; if there is less, add water.
Skim off and discard fat.
Stock keeps, covered and chilled, 3 days or frozen up to 1 month.

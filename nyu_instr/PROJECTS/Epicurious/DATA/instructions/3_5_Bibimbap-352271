1 Mix together the first three ingredients; set aside.
2 In a pan, brown the meat in half the vegetable oil, about 5 minutes. Add half the soy-sauce mixture and continue cooking until the liquid is absorbed, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat and cover.
3 In another pan, fry the eggs in the remaining vegetable oil, 4 to 5 minutes.
4 Divide the rice among 4 bowls. Arrange some vegetables and meat and an egg in each. Sprinkle with the sesame seeds, then drizzle the remaining soy-sauce mixture over the top.

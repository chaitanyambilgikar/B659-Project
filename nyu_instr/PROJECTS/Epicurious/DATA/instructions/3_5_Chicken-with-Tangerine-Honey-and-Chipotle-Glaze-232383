For glaze: Boil juice, honey, and soy sauce in heavy medium saucepan until reduced to 2/3 cup, about 20 minutes. Mix in grated peel and chipotle chiles.
For chicken: Whisk first 9 ingredients in 13x9x2-inch glass baking dish to blend. Add chicken; turn to coat with marinade. Cover; chill at least 2 hours and up to 1 day, turning occasionally.
Spray grill rack with nonstick spray and prepare barbecue (medium-low heat). Remove chicken from marinade; discard marinade. Sprinkle chicken lightly with salt. Grill chicken until cooked through, turning and repositioning occasionally for even cooking, about 20 minutes. Brush chicken all over with glaze; grill 2 minutes longer on each side. Transfer chicken to platter. Serve, passing remaining glaze separately.
*Chipotle chiles are dried, smoked jalapeños canned in a spicy tomato sauce, which is sometimes called adobo. They are available at some supermarkets, specialty foods stores, and Latin markets.

Check the mint leaves for any insect life, then tear the leaves into shreds. Put the lemon juice into a large bowl. Add the mint and pound with the end of a wooden rolling pin. Add the sugar and salt and continue to crush the mint leaves to release their menthol essence. Leave to macerate for 8 to 10 hours or overnight.
Pour 2 1/2 cups of boiling water over the macerated mint mixture and let stand for a further 12 hours.
Strain the syrup through a very fine sieve or cheesecloth into a saucepan. Gently bring to a simmer and simmer for a couple of minutes. Pour into warm, sterilized bottles (see p. 125) and seal with screw-caps or corks.
This syrup will keep unopened for 4 months, but once opened, it should be stored in the fridge. If you want to keep it longer, it will need to be sterilized in a water bath straight after canning (see p. 125).

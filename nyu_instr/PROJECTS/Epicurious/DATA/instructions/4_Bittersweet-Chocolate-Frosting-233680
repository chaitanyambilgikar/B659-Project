Stir in butter, then sugar mixture. Cook over low heat until mixture registers 165°F to 170°F on candy thermometer, stirring constantly, about 10 minutes. Immediately pour mixture into bowl; do not scrape sides of pan. Add vanilla.
Using electric mixer, beat frosting until cool. Let frosting stand at room temperature until thick enough to spread, stirring occasionally, 1 1/2 hours.

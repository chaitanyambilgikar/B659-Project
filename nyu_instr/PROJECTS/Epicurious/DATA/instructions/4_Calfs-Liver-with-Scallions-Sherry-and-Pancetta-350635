Soak liver in milk 15 minutes.
Cook pancetta in 1 teaspoon oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until crisp, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain, leaving fat in skillet.
Discard milk and pat liver dry. Stir together flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper on a piece of wax paper or a plate and dredge liver in mixture, knocking off excess.
Add remaining 2 teaspoons oil to fat in skillet and heat over medium-high heat until hot. Cook liver, turning once, until browned but still pink in center, about 4 minutes total. Transfer to plates.
Melt 1 tablespoon butter in skillet over medium-high heat, then sauté scallions until softened, about 1 minute. Add Sherry, water, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper and boil until reduced slightly, about 1 minute. Remove from heat and stir in remaining tablespoon butter until incorporated. Spoon over liver and sprinkle with pancetta.

Preheat oven to 375°F.
Brush bread with 1 tablespoon oil and cut into 1/2-inch cubes. On a baking sheet toast cubes in middle of oven until golden, about 5 minutes, and cool.
In a bowl whisk together vinegar, remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons oil, and salt and pepper to taste until emulsified. Add croutons, walnuts, artichokes, and mesclun and toss until combined.

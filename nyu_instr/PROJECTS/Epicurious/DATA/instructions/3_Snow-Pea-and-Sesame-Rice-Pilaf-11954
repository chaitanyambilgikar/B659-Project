In a microwave-safe bowl combine the oil, the butter, the onion, the scallions, and the gingerroot and microwave the mixture at high power (100%) for 2 minutes, or until the onion is softened. Stir in the rice, stirring until it is coated with the oil mixture, add the broth, and microwave the mixture, covered with microwave-safe plastic wrap, at high power (100%) for 5 minutes. Microwave the mixture at medium power (50%) for 12 to 15 minutes, or until all the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender. Uncover the pilaf carefully and stir in the snow peas. Let the pilaf stand, covered, for 5 minutes and stir in the toasted sesame seeds.

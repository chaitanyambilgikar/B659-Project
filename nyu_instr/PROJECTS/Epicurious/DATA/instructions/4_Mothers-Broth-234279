Cut meat into large pieces, cracking bones in 2 or 3 places with a large heavy knife or cleaver. Put pieces in an 8- to 10-quart pot, then add cold water (6 quarts) and bring to a simmer, skimming froth.
Add remaining ingredients and cook at a bare simmer (do not let boil), partially covered, stirring and skimming occasionally, 12 hours. Keep liquid 2 to 3 inches above solids by adding boiling water as necessary.
Pour broth through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl, discarding solids. (Or ladle broth through sieve for a clearer broth.) Skim off and discard fat.

Roast turkey 45 minutes. Baste with pan juices. Continue to roast until thermometer inserted into thickest part of thigh registers 165°F to 170°F, basting every 45 minutes, adding stock or water to pan by cupfuls if dry, and tenting turkey loosely with foil if browning too quickly, 3 to 31/2 hours longer. Brush turkey with soy sauce glaze twice during last 30 minutes. Transfer turkey to platter; tent very loosely with foil and let rest 30 to 45 minutes. Reserve roasting pan with juices for gravy.
For gravy: Remove turkey neck, heart, and gizzard from roasting pan. Pull meat off neck; chop neck meat, heart, and gizzard and reserve for gravy, if desired. Pour pan juices into 8-cup measuring cup. Spoon off fat from surface, reserving 1/2 cup fat. Add enough turkey stock to degreased pan juices to measure 5 1/4 cups total.
Place reserved roasting pan over 2 burners on medium heat; add 1/2 cup reserved turkey fat and 1/2 cup flour. Whisk until roux is light brown, about 2 minutes. Whisk in Sherry, then stock mixture. Bring to boil, scraping up browned bits and whisking to blend. Boil until gravy is thick enough to coat spoon, about 8 minutes. Add chopped neck, heart, and gizzard, if desired.

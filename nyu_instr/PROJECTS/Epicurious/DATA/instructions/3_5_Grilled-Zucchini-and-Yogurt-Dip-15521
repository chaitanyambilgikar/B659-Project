Prepare grill.
Cut zucchini lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick slices and grill on an oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals until very tender, about 5 minutes on each side.
Mince garlic with salt and mash to a paste. Finely chop zucchini and stir into garlic paste with remaining ingredients.
Serve dip with bruschetta.

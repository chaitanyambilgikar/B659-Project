Heat 1/2 tablespoon oil over moderate heat in a 3-quart heavy saucepan until hot but not smoking, then cook white parts of scallions and mustard seeds, stirring frequently, until scallions are softened, 1 to 2 minutes. Add rice and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add water and salt and bring to a boil. Cook over low heat, covered, until rice is tender and water is absorbed, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and fluff rice with a fork, then let stand, covered, 5 minutes.
While rice is standing, heat remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil in a 10-inch nonstick skillet over moderate heat until hot but not smoking, then cook jalapeño and scallion greens, stirring occasionally, until they begin to soften, about 1 minute. Add snap peas and cook, stirring, until crisp-tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Toss with rice and season with salt.

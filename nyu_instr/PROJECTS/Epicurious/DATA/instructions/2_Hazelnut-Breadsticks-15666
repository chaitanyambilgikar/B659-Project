Mix 1/2 cup warm water, 1/2 cup flour and 1 teaspoon yeast in large bowl to blend well. Cover and let starter stand at room temperature overnight.
Heat oil in heavy small saucepan over medium-low heat. Add sage and sauté until crisp, about 7 minutes. Cool.
Combine remaining 1 tablespoon water and 1/2 teaspoon yeast in small bowl; stir to blend. Let stand 10 minutes to dissolve yeast. Transfer to processor.
Add remaining 2 cups flour, hazelnuts, milk and salt to yeast mixture in processor. Using on/off turns, process until small moist clumps form. Add sage-oil mixture and starter. Process just until large moist clumps form. Transfer dough to clean work surface. Gather dough into ball. Knead until dough is smooth and elastic, about 4 minutes. Form dough into ball.
Lightly oil another large bowl. Add dough; turn to coat. Cover bowl with plastic wrap, then towel. Let dough rise in warm draft-free area until doubled in volume, about 1 hour. Punch down dough. Cover. Let dough rest 15 minutes.
Preheat oven to 400°F. Lightly oil 3 large baking sheets. Turn dough out onto floured work surface and knead briefly until smooth. Divide dough into thirds.
Divide first third of dough into 7 equal pieces. Roll 1 dough piece between palms and work surface into 13-inch-long rope. Transfer rope to baking sheet. Repeat with remaining 6 dough pieces, spacing ropes evenly apart. If desired, shape 1 end of each rope decoratively. Let rise 10 minutes. Bake breadsticks until golden and very crisp, about 20 minutes. Transfer to racks and cool.
Meanwhile, shape second third of dough into 7 breadsticks and let rise 10 minutes. Bake as above. Repeat with final third of dough. (Can be made ahead. Wrap tightly and store at room temperature 1 day or freeze up to 2 weeks.)

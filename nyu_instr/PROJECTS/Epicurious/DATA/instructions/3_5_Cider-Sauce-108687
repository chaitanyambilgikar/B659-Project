Scrape seeds from vanilla bean with a sharp knife into a 2- to 3-quart heavy saucepan. Quarter apples (do not peel or core) and add to vanilla seeds along with pod and remaining ingredients. Simmer, uncovered, 1 hour.
Pour sauce through a fine-mesh sieve into a blender (do not press on solids) and blend until emulsified (use caution when blending hot liquids). Serve immediately.

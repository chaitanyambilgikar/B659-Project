Soak goat meat in goat's milk overnight in fridge. Slice meat thin, reserving milk. Soak potatoes in goat's milk, aside from the goat, for 1 hour. Pat goat dry, season with salt and pepper to taste, and then brown meat in a large sauté pan in the olive oil. Remove meat. Sauté onions in same pan until slightly golden; add garlic, parsley, and thyme. Cook for 10 minutes and set aside. Deglaze the pan with wine.
Layer the bottom of a casserole dish with half the onion mixture. On top, place the goat and then the potatoes in a layer; finish with remaining onions. Almost fully cover top layer with goat's milk and deglazing liquid from pan. Mix bread crumbs with goat cheese and sprinkle over gratin.
Cover and cook in 350°F oven for 1 1/2 hours; uncover and cook for another 20 minutes, until cheese and bread crumbs are toasted and liquids are bubbling.

Prepare vegetables: Cut beans and scallions crosswise into 1/4-inch pieces and transfer to a bowl. Cut zucchini and bell pepper into 1/4-inch dice and add to bean mixture. In a 3-quart saucepan bring water and sugar to a boil. Blanch vegetables 30 seconds in sugar water and drain in a sieve. In a bowl stir together vegetables, oil, and salt and pepper to taste and cool. Vegetables may be prepared 1 day ahead and chilled, covered. Bring vegetables to room temperature before proceeding. Add lemon juice to vegetables, tossing to combine.
Make scallops: Remove tough muscle from side of each scallop if necessary and horizontally halve each scallop to form 2 rounds. Pat scallops dry and season with salt and pepper. In a 10-inch skillet heat 1/2 tablespoon oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking. Arrange half of scallops in skillet, without crowding, and sauté until golden and just cooked through, about 15 seconds on each side. Transfer scallops to a plate and keep warm, covered. Wipe skillet clean and repeat procedure with remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil and scallops. To drippings remaining in skillet add wine, butter, lemon juice, and any juices that have accumulated from scallops on plate and simmer, stirring and scraping up brown bits, until reduced to about 1/4 cup.
Divide vegetables, mounding them, among 6 plates and top with scallops. Spoon 2 teaspoons sauce over each serving and sprinkle with chives.

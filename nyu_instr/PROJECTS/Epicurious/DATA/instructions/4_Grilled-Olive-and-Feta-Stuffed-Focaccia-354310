Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Let dough rest on work surface 15 to 20 minutes. Stretch and roll out dough to thin irregular 16x9-inch rectangle. Sprinkle half of dough evenly with crumbled feta cheese, golden raisins, diced Kalamata olives, and 3/4 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary; sprinkle lightly with coarsely ground pepper. Fold plain dough half over filling to enclose, forming about 9-inch square. Seal dough edges.
Sprinkle large piece of parchment paper with flour. Transfer dough to parchment; pierce to release any air pockets. Roll out dough to 11- to 12-inch square. Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon flaked salt over; press into dough.
Using parchment as aid, flip dough over onto grill. Sprinkle top with 1/4 teaspoon flaked salt; press into dough. Cook until bottom of dough is brown, 5 to 6 minutes. Turn focaccia over. Brush top lightly with oil. Cook until bottom is deep brown and bread is cooked through, 5 to 6 minutes. Turn bread over onto cutting board; brush top lightly with oil. Sprinkle with remaining 1/4 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary.

For chicken: Place large rack on large rimmed baking sheet. Mix sugar, turmeric, and cayenne in small bowl. Sprinkle chicken on both sides with salt and generous amount of spice mixture. Arrange chicken, skin side down, on rack. Let stand at room temperature 2 hours or cover and chill overnight.
Preheat broiler. Broil chicken halves on rack on baking sheet until beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Turn chicken over and broil until skin is charred, about 5 minutes, or broil chicken parts 1 minute, then turn and broil until skin is charred, about 5 minutes. Remove from broiler.
Set oven temperature at 450°F. Roast chicken on rack on same sheet until cooked through, about 25 minutes for halves and 14 minutes for parts.
Transfer chicken halves to board. Cut each into 4 pieces, or cut each chicken breast in half and leave thighs intact. Arrange chicken on platter. Spoon dressing over; sprinkle with cilantro.

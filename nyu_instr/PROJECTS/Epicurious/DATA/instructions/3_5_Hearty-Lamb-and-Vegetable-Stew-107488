Place lamb in large bowl. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Add flour and toss to coat. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add half of lamb and sauté until brown, about 5 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer lamb to medium bowl. Repeat with remaining lamb. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in same pot. Add bell pepper, onion, lemon peel, garlic, and bay leaves. Sauté until onion begins to soften, about 5 minutes. Return lamb and any accumulated juices to pot. Add broth and tomato paste. Bring to boil, scraping up browned bits. Reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer 50 minutes. Add carrots; cover and simmer until lamb and carrots are tender, about 20 minutes longer. Add peas. Simmer uncovered until peas are tender and gravy thickens, about 5 minutes. Discard bay leaves. Season stew to taste with salt and pepper; ladle into bowls. Sprinkle with parsley.

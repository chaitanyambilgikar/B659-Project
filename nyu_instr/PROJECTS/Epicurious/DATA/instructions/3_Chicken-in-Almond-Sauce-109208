Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 375°F.
Spread 1/4 cup almonds on a baking sheet and toast in oven until golden, 8 to 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, finely grind remaining 1/2 cup almonds in a food processor about 1 minute (don't grind to a paste).
Pat chicken dry and sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt.
Heat a dry 12-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat, then toast ground almonds, cinnamon stick, oregano, and bay leaves, stirring constantly, until almonds are pale golden, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and wipe skillet clean.
Heat oil in skillet over high heat until hot but not smoking, then sauté chicken, turning over once, until golden, about 5 minutes total. Transfer chicken to a plate.
Add bacon to skillet and cook over moderate heat, stirring, until bacon begins to render fat and turn golden, about 1 minute. Add onion and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 3 minutes. Stir in ground- almond mixture and chicken broth and boil, scraping up brown bits, 1 minute. Stir in pepper and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. Add chicken, turning to coat, then reduce heat to moderate and simmer, covered, until chicken is just cooked through, about 5 minutes. Stir in parsley and sliced almonds. Discard cinnamon stick and bay leaves. Serve chicken with sauce spooned on top.

Boil 4 cups water; season with bay leaves and salt. Add quinoa and return to a boil. Reduce heat, cover and simmer about 20 minutes, until quinoa absorbs water. Remove from heat; remove bay leaves and let cool. Meanwhile, heat 3 tbsp oil in a frying pan. Sauté zucchini and squash — season with salt and pepper — until slightly browned. Combine vegetables and quinoa. Drizzle on remaining 1 tbsp oil. Stir in onions, apricots, cranberries, parsley, and mint. Grate in lemon peel and squeeze on lemon juice to taste. Season with salt and pepper.

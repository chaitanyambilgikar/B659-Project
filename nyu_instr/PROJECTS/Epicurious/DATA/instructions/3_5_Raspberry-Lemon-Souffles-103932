Preheat oven to 400°F. Spray six 3/4-cup soufflé dishes or custard cups with oil spray. Place dishes on baking sheet. Puree raspberries with juices in processor. Strain puree into heavy medium saucepan, pressing to extract as much liquid as possible. Add 4 tablespoons sugar, jam and cornstarch to saucepan. Whisk over medium heat until mixture boils and thickens, about 2 minutes. Add lemon peel and vanilla. Transfer to large bowl. Cool, whisking occasionally.
Using electric mixer, beat egg whites and salt in another large bowl until soft peaks form. Gradually add 3 tablespoons sugar; beat until stiff but not dry. Fold 1/3 of whites into raspberry mixture; fold in remaining whites. Divide mixture among prepared dishes. Bake soufflés until puffed and golden, about 16 minutes. Sprinkle with powdered sugar and serve.

Soften gelatin in 1 tablespoon cold water.
In small saucepan, heat sugar and half and half until sugar dissolves.
Whisk in softened gelatin (from above) and vanilla extract.
In small bowl, whisk matcha with 2 tablespoons of half and half mixture until smooth.
Mix in remaining half and half mixture; strain and divide among four 2/3-cup ramekins or custard cups. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until gelatin sets, at least 2 hours.
Fill medium bowl with hot water; dip ramekins in hot water for 30 seconds. Invert, shaking gently to release panna cotta. Garnish plates with strawberries.

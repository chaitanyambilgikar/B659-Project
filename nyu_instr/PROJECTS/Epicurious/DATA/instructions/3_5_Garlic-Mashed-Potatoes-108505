Put oven rack in middle position and preheat to 450°F.
Cut off and discard top 1/2 inch of head of garlic, exposing cloves. Rub garlic all over with oil and season with salt and pepper, then wrap in foil. Roast garlic until tender when center of a clove is pierced with tip of a paring knife, about 40 minutes.
Peel potato and cut into 1-inch pieces, then cover with cold salted water in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, until potato is tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Pour off water, then add half-and-half, butter, and 2 or 3 peeled roasted garlic cloves (reserve remaining roasted garlic for another use). Mash with a potato masher to desired consistency and season with salt and pepper.

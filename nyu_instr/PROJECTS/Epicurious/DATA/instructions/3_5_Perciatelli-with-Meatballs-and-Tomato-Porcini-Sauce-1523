Place mushrooms in small bowl. Pour 2 cups hot water over; soak 30 minutes to soften. Remove mushrooms from water; squeeze liquid from mushrooms back into bowl. Chop mushrooms; reserve liquid.
For sauce: Heat olive oil in heavy large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add onions and garlic; sauté until tender, about 8 minutes. Add rosemary and crushed red pepper; stir 30 seconds. Add tomatoes and 1 cup chopped porcini. Pour in mushroom liquid, leaving sediment in bowl. Bring to boil. Reduce heat; simmer 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, prepare meatballs: Place bread in medium bowl. Pour milk over. Let stand until bread is very soft, about 15 minutes. Squeeze milk from bread; place bread in large bowl. Add veal, sausage, 3/4 cup cheese, egg, rosemary, salt, pepper and remaining porcini mushrooms. Using hands, blend veal mixture thoroughly.
Pour oil into heavy large skillet to depth of 1/4 inch; heat over medium-high heat. Working in batches, form veal mixture into 1 1/2-inch balls; add to skillet. Cook until brown, about 4 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer meatballs to paper towels; drain.
Add meatballs to tomato sauce. Simmer until sauce thickens and meatballs are just cooked through, about 10 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Before using, bring to simmer, stirring frequently.)
Cook pasta in pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally. Drain. Transfer to platter. Spoon sauce and meatballs over. Serve, passing additional cheese separately.

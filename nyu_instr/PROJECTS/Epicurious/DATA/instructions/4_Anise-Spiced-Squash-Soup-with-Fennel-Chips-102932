Make soup: Cook fennel, squash, onion, and anise seeds in butter in a 6- to 8-quart pot over moderate heat, covered, stirring occasionally, 15 minutes. Add water and simmer, covered, until squash is very tender, 25 to 30 minutes.
Purée soup in batches in a blender (use caution when blending hot liquids) and season with salt and pepper.
Make fennel chips: Preheat oven to 225°F.
Boil water and sugar in a small saucepan, stirring, until sugar is dissolved. Remove from heat and add lemon juice. Cut fennel bulb lengthwise into paper-thin slices using a mandoline or other manual slicer. Pour sugar mixture over fennel in a bowl and let stand 5 minutes.
Put Silpat or Exopat pad on a baking sheet. Shake off excess liquid from fennel slices and arrange on pad in 1 layer (don't let slices touch). Bake in middle of oven 1 hour, or until dry and crisp. Working quickly, carefully peel chips off liner and transfer to a rack to cool. Top soup with chips.

Prepare barbecue (high heat). Toss shrimp with coarse salt in bowl. Thread 6 shrimp on each metal skewer. Let stand at room temperature 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, cut green onions into 3-inch-long pieces, reserving green tops; thinly slice tops. Lightly coat 3-inch-long green onion pieces and tomatoes with 1 teaspoon oil. Grill green onion pieces and tomatoes until blistered and slightly charred, turning frequently, about 2 minutes for green onions and 6 minutes for tomatoes. Transfer to blender. Add remaining 3/4 cup oil, Sherry wine vinegar, and cayenne. Blend until smooth. Season to taste with salt.
Transfer 1 cup dressing to small bowl; stir in 1 tablespoon thinly sliced green onion tops and set aside. Brush remaining dressing over shrimp. Grill shrimp until cooked through, about 2 minutes per side.
Spoon 2 1/2 tablespoons reserved dressing onto each of 6 plates, using back of spoon to spread over plate. Top with 1 shrimp skewer. Sprinkle shrimp with remaining thinly sliced green onion tops and serve.

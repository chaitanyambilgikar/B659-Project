Cook bacon in heavy large skillet over medium heat until brown and crisp. Transfer bacon to paper towels and drain. Crumble bacon.
Pour off all but 2 tablespoons drippings from skillet. Add okra, celery and onion to skillet. Increase heat to medium-high; sauté until vegetables are almost tender, about 8 minutes. Mix in tomatoes with their juices, rice and bacon. Simmer until most liquid is absorbed, about 2 minutes. Season with cayenne pepper, Worcestershire sauce, salt and pepper.

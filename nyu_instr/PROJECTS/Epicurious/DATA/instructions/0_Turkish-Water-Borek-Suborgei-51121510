To prepare the dough: 1. In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, wheat starch, eggs, lemon juice, and salt. On a lightly floured surface, knead the dough until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes; or, knead the dough in a stand mixer fitted with a hook attachment on medium speed until smooth and elastic, 6 to 7 minutes. Cover and let rest for 30 minutes.
2. Fill a large bowl with ice water and set aside. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Divide the dough into 4 equal portions. Cover the portions with a damp towel and, working in batches, roll them out using a rolling pin or pasta machine to about 1/8-inch thickness. As you finish rolling out each piece, lightly flour it to prevent the sheets from sticking together.
3. Working in batches, boil each piece of rolled dough until tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Immediately cool each cooked piece in the bowl of ice water to stop it from cooking. Remove the dough from the water bath, pat dry, and lightly rub each with some olive oil to keep them from sticking together. Set aside.
To prepare the filling: 1. In a large skillet over medium heat, add 1 tablespoon of oil. Add the spinach to the pan, toss, and cover with a tight-fitting lid. Cook the spinach, tossing occasionally, until wilted, 3 to 4 minutes. Set aside to cool.
2. In a large mixing bowl, whisk the eggs, milk, and remaining 1/2 cup oil together. Set aside.
To assemble the borek: 1. Preheat the oven to 375°F. Lightly rub the inside of a large baking dish with some olive oil.
2. Assemble the dish by first laying down a piece of cooked dough and then scattering some wilted spinach, Feta, and herbs over top. Ladle some of the milk-egg mixture over top. Repeat the assembly, building layer over layer, and ending with cheese and herbs on top.
3. Bake until the egg is set and the top is golden brown, about 35 minutes. Let rest 10 minutes before serving.

With a sharp thin knife thinly slice kumquats crosswise, removing seeds. Pick over cranberries. In a small saucepan bring water with sugar to a boil and simmer, stirring until sugar is dissolved, 5 minutes. Add kumquats and simmer 5 minutes. With a slotted spoon transfer kumquats to a bowl. Add cranberries to syrup and simmer 10 minutes. Cool mixture completely. (Cranberry mixture and kumquats may be made 3 days ahead and chilled in separate airtight containers - so kumquats will retain their color).
Just before serving, stir kumquats into cranberry mixture.

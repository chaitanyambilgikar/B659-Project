Combine first 3 ingredients in medium saucepan. Stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Simmer until liquid is reduced to generous 1 cup, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in orange flower water. Cover; chill until cold. Discard anise. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.)
Using small knife, cut off peel and white pith from oranges. Slice oranges crosswise into 1/3-inch-thick rounds. Set in bowls. Spoon syrup over. Top with mint.

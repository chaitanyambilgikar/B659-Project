1. Preheat the oven to 425°F. Cut the bell peppers in half lengthwise; carefully remove the core and seeds. Oil a large baking dish and arrange the peppers cut-side up. Brush the peppers with oil.
2. Arrange 2 anchovy fillets in an "X" on the bottom of each pepper, if desired. Place 4 garlic slices in each pepper. Place 4 red cherry tomatoes in each yellow pepper half and 4 yellow cherry tomatoes in each red pepper half. Sprinkle 4 or 5 capers and some thyme in each. Drizzle each with the 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Bake for 35 minutes, then cool to room temperature.
3. To serve, place 1 red pepper half and 1 yellow pepper half on each of 6 plates; drizzle lightly with balsamic vinegar.

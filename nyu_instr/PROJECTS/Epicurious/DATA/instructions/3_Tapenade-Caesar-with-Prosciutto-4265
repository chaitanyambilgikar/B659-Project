Make tapenade: Blend olives, raisins, parsley, anchovies, shallots, lemon juice, fennel seeds and cayenne in processor until almost smooth, occasionally scraping down sides of bowl. With machine running, add oil and process until blended. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Make dressing: Whisk lemon juice, Parmesan, mustard, anchovies, capers and garlic in medium bowl until well blended. Gradually whisk in oil. Season with salt and pepper. (Tapenade and dressing can be made 2 days ahead. Cover separately and refrigerate. Bring to room temperature before using.)
Place lettuce in large bowl. Toss with enough dressing to coat generously. Divide lettuce among 6 plates. Dot perimeter of each plate with teaspoonfuls of tapenade. Top each salad with prosciutto and cheese and serve.

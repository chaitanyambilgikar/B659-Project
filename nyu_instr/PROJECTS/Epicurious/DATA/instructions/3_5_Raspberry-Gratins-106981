Using electric mixer, beat sugar, yolks, 4 tablespoons framboise, and 2 tablespoons cream in large metal bowl to blend. Set bowl over saucepan of barely simmering water (do not allow bowl to touch water) and continue beating until mixture is thick and billowy and instant-read thermometer inserted into center registers 160°F, about 9 minutes. Remove bowl from over water. Continue beating until mixture is cool, occasionally scraping down sides of bowl, about 5 minutes. Beat remaining 2 tablespoons framboise and 1 1/4 cups cream in medium bowl until peaks form. Fold cream into yolk mixture in 2 additions. (Sabayon can be prepared 8 hours ahead. Cover; chill.)
Preheat broiler. Divide raspberries equally among eight 1 1/4-cup custard cups or shallow ramekins. Top raspberries with sabayon. Broil until sabayon is lightly browned, watching carefully to avoid burning, about 2 minutes. Serve warm.
* Sold at some liquor stores and specialty foods stores. If unavailable, use raspberry liqueur instead.

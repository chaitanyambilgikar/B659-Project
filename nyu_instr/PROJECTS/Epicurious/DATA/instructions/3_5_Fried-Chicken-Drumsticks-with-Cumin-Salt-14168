In a large sealable plastic bag combine buttermilk and 1/2 tablespoon cumin. Add drumsticks and seal bag, pressing out excess air. Marinate drumsticks at room temperature 15 minutes. In another plastic bag combine flour and salt and pepper to taste. In a small cup stir together remaining 1/2 tablespoon cumin, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.
In a 4 1/2- to 5-quart kettle (preferably cast-iron) heat oil until a deep-fat thermometer registers 345° F. Just before oil reaches 345° F. drain half of drumsticks. Add drumsticks to bag with flour mixture and shake to coat, knocking off excess. Using tongs lower floured drumsticks carefully into hot oil. Fry drumsticks, turning occasionally and regulating heat to keep oil at a constant 345° F., until mahogany-colored and cooked through, about 12 minutes. Transfer fried drumsticks with tongs to a rack set over paper towels to drain and season while hot with half of cumin salt. Prepare remaining drumsticks in same manner.

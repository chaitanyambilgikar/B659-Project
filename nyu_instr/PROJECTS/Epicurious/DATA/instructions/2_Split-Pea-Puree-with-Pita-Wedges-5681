Combine water, peas, bay leaves and garlic in heavy large saucepan. Bring to boil, skimming foam off top of water. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer uncovered until thick, whisking often, about 1 hour. Cool slightly. Discard bay leaves.
Whisk 3 tablespoons oil and 2 tablespoons lemon juice into pea mixture. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 8 hours ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Bring to room temperature before serving.)
Transfer mixture to platter. Sprinkle with green onions and capers. Drizzle 2 tablespoons oil and 2 tablespoons lemon juice over. Top with arugula. Serve warm or at room temperature with pita wedges.

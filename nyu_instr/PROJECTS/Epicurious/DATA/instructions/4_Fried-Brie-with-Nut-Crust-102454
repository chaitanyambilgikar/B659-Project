Freeze Brie for 30 minutes. Finely chop all nuts and sesame seeds in food processor. Transfer to medium bowl. In another medium bowl, whisk eggs and cream to blend. Remove cheese from freezer. Dip each wedge into egg mixture and then into nut mixture, turning to coat and pressing gently to adhere. Transfer to plate; cover with plastic and refrigerate until very cold, at least 45 minutes. (Can be made 6 hours ahead. Keep refrigerated.)
Pour enough peanut oil into heavy large skillet to reach depth of 1 1/2 inches. Heat over medium-high heat to 350°F. Working in 2 batches, fry Brie until deep golden brown, turning occasionally with metal spatula, about 3 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer to paper towels to drain. Serve with purchased jalapeño jelly and baguette slices.

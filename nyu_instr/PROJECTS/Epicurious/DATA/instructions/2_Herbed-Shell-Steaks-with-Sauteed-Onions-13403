On a work surface mash together the garlic paste, the pepper, and the orégano and rub the mixture onto the steaks. In a heavy skillet, preferably cast-iron, heat the oil over moderately high heat until it is hot but not smoking, in it sauté the onions, stirring occasionally, for 6 minutes, or until they golden, and transfer them with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain. Heat the oil remaining in the skillet over moderately high heat until it is hot but not smoking, in it sauté the steaks for 3 1/2 minutes on each side for medium-rare meat, and transfer the steaks with tongs to plates. Pour off the fat from the skillet, add 1/4 cup water, and boil it, scraping up the brown bits, for 15 seconds. Stir in the onions and spoon the onion mixture over the steaks.

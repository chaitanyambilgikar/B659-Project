Make wings: Preheat oven to 500°F.
Pat wings dry and toss with oil, ginger, and garlic. Arrange wings, thick-skin sides up, in 1 layer in a large shallow baking pan and roast in upper third of oven 25 minutes.
Turn on broiler and broil wings, turning once, until nicely browned and crisp, 10 to 15 minutes.
Make sauce while wings cook: Whisk together sauce ingredients in a large bowl until blended.
Add wings to sauce and toss until coated.

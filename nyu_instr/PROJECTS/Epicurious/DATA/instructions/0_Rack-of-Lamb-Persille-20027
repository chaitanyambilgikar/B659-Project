Ask the butcher to cut the rack so that you can carve right through the chops without having to struggle with the bones. Trim it and wrap the bone ends of the chops with foil. Blend the garlic, the bread crumbs, and parsley. Rub the roast well with butter and freshly ground black pepper.
Place on a rack in a roasting pan, and roast in a 375°F. oven, basting every 10 minutes. After about 20 minutes, test for internal temperature. If it is near 130°F. - 135°F., remove from the oven. Blend the degreased pan juices with the crumb mixture, salt the roast and spread an even film of the crumb mixture over it. Dot with butter, and return to the oven until the mixture has browned nicely and the rack is done.
Serve with sautéed potatoes and broccoli au buerre noir. Drink a light red Bordeaux.

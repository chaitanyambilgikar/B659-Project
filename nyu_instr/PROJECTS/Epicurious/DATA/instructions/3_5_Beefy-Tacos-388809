In a large skillet over medium-high heat, stir beef and onion until brown and cooked through, about 6 minutes. Add garlic, stirring frequently, 1 minute. Drain excess oils and transfer to a slow cooker. Stir in beans, salsa, cheddar and serranos. Cover and let simmer until mixture is cooked through and bubbling, 3 to 4 hours on high or 5 to 6 hours on low. Stir and serve over warmed tortillas; top with tomatoes, lettuce and a dollop of sour cream; garnish with cilantro. Add hot sauce, if desired.

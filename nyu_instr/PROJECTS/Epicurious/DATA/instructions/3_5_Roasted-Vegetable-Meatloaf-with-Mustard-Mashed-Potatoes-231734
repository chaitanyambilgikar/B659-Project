Preheat oven to 450°F. Combine zucchini, peppers, and onions in medium bowl. Add oil and 1 tablespoon rosemary; toss to coat. Spread evenly on rimmed baking sheet; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Roast until vegetables are tender, about 25 minutes. Remove from oven; cool.
Preheat oven to 375°F. Mix ground beef, mozzarella, panko, basil, marjoram, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, dried crushed pepper, 1 tablespoon rosemary, and 1 cup roasted vegetables in large bowl. Whisk 1/2 cup ketchup, eggs, and wine in medium bowl. Add to beef mixture; stir with wooden spoon until well incorporated; spoon into 9x5x3-inch loaf pan, forming rounded top.
Spoon 1/2 cup ketchup over top of loaf. Bake meatloaf until cooked through, juices run clear, and top is browned, about 1 hour 10 minutes. Remove pan from oven; let meatloaf rest 20 minutes.
Rewarm remaining vegetable mixture in large nonstick skillet. Turn meatloaf out; cut into 1-inch-thick slices. Top with warm roasted vegetable mixture; serve with mashed potatoes.
*Flaky panko crumbs are the best substitute for fresh breadcrumbs in almost anything, including meatloaf. Look for them in the Asian foods section of the supermarket and at Asian markets.

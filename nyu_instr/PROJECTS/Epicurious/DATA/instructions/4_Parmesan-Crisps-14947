Preheat oven to 350°F and line a lightly-greased baking sheet with parchment paper.
In a small bowl stir together Parmesan and flour. On prepared baking sheet spoon level tablespoons of mixture in mounds 4 inches apart and spread mounds gently into 3 1/2-inch-long ovals. Bake crisps in middle of oven until golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool crisps completely on baking sheet and remove carefully with a metal spatula. Crisps may be made 2 days in advance and kept between layers of wax paper in an airtight container at room temperature.

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat) or preheat broiler. Toss first 5 ingredients in bowl. Season with salt and pepper.
Thread 2 pieces of tuna alternately with 1 orange piece and 1 cherry tomato on each skewer. Rub any remaining seasonings from bowl over kebabs.
Grill or broil kebabs until tuna is just opaque in center, turning kebabs often, about 6 minutes total.

Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally. Drain. Transfer pasta to medium bowl; toss with 1 tablespoon oil and parsley. Season generously with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 1 hour ahead. Let pasta stand at room temperature, tossing occasionally.)
Lightly oil large plate. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in heavy medium skillet over medium heat. Add pasta to skillet, spreading evenly, flattening top, and pressing down with spatula to compress. Cook until brown and crisp, about 3 minutes. Carefully invert cake onto prepared plate. Return skillet to medium heat. Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Slide noodle cake into skillet and cook until brown and crisp on bottom, about 3 minutes. Transfer cake to cutting board, cut into wedges, and serve.

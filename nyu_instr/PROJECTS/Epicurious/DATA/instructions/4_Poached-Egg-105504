Add 1 teaspoon unflavored vinegar and 2 tablespoons salt to water. Bring to a rapid boil, and lower the flame until the water merely shivers.
With a wooden spoon, stir water in a rotary movement so as to form a whirlpool in the center. Crack an absolutely 100 percent fresh egg into a cup. Lift the cup with your left hand while you are stirring with your right, and in a simultaneous motion, stop stirring and slide the egg into the very center of the whirlpool.
Cook 3 1/2 to 4 minutes, slightly longer for a harder yolk.

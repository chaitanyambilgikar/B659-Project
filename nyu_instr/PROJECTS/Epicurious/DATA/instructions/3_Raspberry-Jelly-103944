1. Place the berries in a large, heavy stockpot and place them over medium heat. Cook, shaking the pan, until the berries deflate and are hot through, which will take 10 to 15 minutes. Remove them from the heat and put them through a food mill, to extract the juice. You should have about 3 pounds of juice.
2. Place the juice and the sugar in the stockpot and cook over medium heat, stirring, until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture is boiling gently. Skim off any impurities (there aren't likely to be many), and cook until the mixture falls thickly from the spoon, which should take between 20 and 30 minutes.
3. Remove from the heat and seal according to the jar manufacturer's instructions.

In a medium bowl, whisk the egg yolk, Splenda, vanilla, and salt. Alternately whisk in the milk and flour, stirring well after each addition, to make a thin, smooth batter.
In another bowl, whisk the egg whites until they hold stiff peaks. Gently and quickly fold them into the pancake batter.
Lightly coat a large nonstick skillet with cooking spray; place over medium- high heat. Drop about 2 tablespoons of batter into the skillet for each pancake. Cook as many pancakes at once as will fit comfortably, turning them when they are browned. Total cooking time is about 3 minutes per pancake. Serve with the berries.

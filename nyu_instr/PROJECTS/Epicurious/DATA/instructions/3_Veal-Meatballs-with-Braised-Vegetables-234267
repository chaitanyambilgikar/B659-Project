Heat 1/2 cup broth until warm, then add matzo meal and soak 10 minutes.
While matzo soaks, chop enough olives to measure 1/3 cup, then quarter remainder and set aside. Pulse soaked matzo and chopped olives in a food processor along with garlic, egg, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper until olives and garlic are finely chopped and egg is incorporated. Add 1/4 cup parsley and pulse until parsley is finely chopped.
Transfer matzo mixture to a bowl and add veal, mixing gently with your hands until combined. Chill, covered, 30 minutes.
Preheat broiler. Line a 15- by 10-inch shallow baking pan or baking sheet with foil, and brush foil with oil. Using wet hands, form veal mixture into 1 1/2-inch balls, arranging in 1 layer as formed in baking pan.
Broil meatballs 4 to 6 inches from heat, turning once with a spatula and tongs, until browned, about 10 minutes total.
While meatballs are broiling, heat 3 tablespoons oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet (2 to 3 inches deep) over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking. Brown fennel in 2 batches, turning occasionally, 5 to 7 minutes per batch. Transfer to a plate, then brown carrots in remaining 2 tablespoons oil in skillet, stirring occasionally, 5 to 7 minutes.
Return fennel to skillet and add meatballs, remaining 2 cups chicken broth, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and pepper. Simmer, covered, until vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes.
Whisk together water and potato starch in a small bowl. Stir into meatball mixture and boil, uncovered, until sauce is thickened slightly, about 2 minutes (sauce will continue to thicken off the heat). Remove from heat and sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoons parsley and quartered olives. Season with salt.

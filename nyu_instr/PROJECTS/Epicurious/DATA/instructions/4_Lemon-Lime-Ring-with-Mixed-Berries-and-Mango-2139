For mousse: Line 12-cup ring mold with plastic wrap, allowing plastic to overhang edges by 3 inches. Whisk first 6 ingredients in large metal bowl to blend. Set bowl over saucepan of simmering water (do not allow bowl to touch water); whisk until candy thermometer registers 180°F, about 7 minutes. Remove bowl from over water. Using electric mixer, beat mixture until cool and thick, about 8 minutes.
Beat cream in another large bowl until stiff peaks form. Fold cream into egg mixture. Spoon into mold; smooth top. Cover and freeze overnight. (Can be prepared 1 week ahead. Keep frozen.)
For fruit: Toss strawberries with sugar in large bowl. Let stand 20 minutes. Add mangoes, raspberries, blackberries and blueberries; toss to coat.
Turn frozen mousse out onto platter. Peel off plastic. Smooth top and sides with metal icing spatula. Mound some fruit in center of mousse. Garnish with lime- and lemon-peel twists and mint. Serve, passing remaining fruit separately.

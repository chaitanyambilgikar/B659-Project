Preheat oven to 400°F. Rinse potatoes thoroughly with cold water; wipe dry. Cut each potato lengthwise into quarters. Combine potatoes and olive oil in large bowl; toss to coat will. Arrange potato quarters, 1 flat side down, on baking sheet. Bake 30 minutes. Using metal spatula, turn potatoes onto second flat side. Continue to bake until potatoes are tender and deep brown, about 30 minutes longer. Season potatoes with salt and pepper. Serve hot.

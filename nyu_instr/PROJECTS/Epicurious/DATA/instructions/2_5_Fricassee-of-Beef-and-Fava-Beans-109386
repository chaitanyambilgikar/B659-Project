Cook fresh fava beans in large pot of boiling salted water 2 minutes. Drain favas. Place in large bowl of ice water. Drain. Slip outer skin off each bean and discard skin; place beans in large bowl. (If using frozen beans, do not blanch.)
Melt 1 tablespoon butter with 1 tablespoon oil in large nonstick skillet over high heat. Working in batches, add beef and sauté just until browned on both sides, about 2 minutes. Transfer beef to medium bowl.
Melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter with 1 tablespoon oil in same skillet over medium heat. Add onions; sauté until tender and golden, about 15 minutes. Add fava beans; sauté 5 minutes. Remove from heat; cool 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, whisk whipping cream, lemon juice, egg yolks, salt, and pepper in small bowl to blend. Stir cream mixture into fava bean mixture. Cook over medium-low heat just until sauce thickens slightly and mixture is heated through, about 6 minutes (do not boil). Add beef and stir until heated through, about 3 minutes. Transfer fricassee to rimmed platter. Sprinkle with mint.

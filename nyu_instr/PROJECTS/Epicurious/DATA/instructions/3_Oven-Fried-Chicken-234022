1. Preheat the oven to 375°F.
2. In a large plastic bag, combine the thyme, oregano, basil, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Shake well. Add two breasts at a time to the bag and shake to coat the chicken. Continue until all the breasts are coated.
3. Place the yogurt in a large bowl, and the cereal on a large plate. Dip each breast in the yogurt and then in the cereal. Place the chicken breasts on a baking sheet sprayed with nonstick cooking spray.
4. Bake for 35 to 45 minutes, until the chicken is brown and cooked through. Do not cover or turn the chicken during the baking process.
5. When the chicken is completely cooked, remove the baking sheet from the oven and let cool ten minutes before serving.

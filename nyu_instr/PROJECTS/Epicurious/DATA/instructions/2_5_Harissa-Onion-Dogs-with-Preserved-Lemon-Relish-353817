For relish: Bring first 3 ingredients to boil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Cover and simmer until lemons are tender, about 12 minutes. Uncover; simmer until liquid thickens to syrup, about 8 minutes. Transfer syrup to bowl and cool. Chop lemon slices; add to bowl. Mix in herbs, oil, and garlic.
For onions: Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add onions; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cover; cook until onions are golden, stirring often, about 25 minutes. Add 1/2 cup water and 1 tablespoon harissa. Simmer until water is absorbed, 4 to 5 minutes. Add more harissa, if desired.
For hot dogs: Spread hummus on buns or crosswise in strip on each lavash sheet. Top each with grilled hot dog, then onions and relish. Roll up lavash, if using, and serve.

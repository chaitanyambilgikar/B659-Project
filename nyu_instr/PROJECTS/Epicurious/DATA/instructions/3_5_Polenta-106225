Whisk 1 1/2 cups water, polenta, and salt in heavy large saucepan. Stir over medium heat until mixture comes to simmer. Gradually whisk in remaining 4 1/2 cups water. Bring to boil, whisking polenta often. Reduce heat to low; cover and cook until polenta is thick, soft, and creamy, stirring often, about 30 minutes.
* Available at Italian markets, natural foods stores, and some supermarkets. If polenta is unavailable, substitute 1 1/2 cups regular yellow cornmeal and cook mixture for about 15 minutes.

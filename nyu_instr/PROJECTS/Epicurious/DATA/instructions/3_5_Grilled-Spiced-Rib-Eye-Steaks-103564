Prepare grill for cooking.
Let steaks stand at room temperature 30 minutes. Stir together allspice, cumin, and salt. Pat steaks dry and sprinkle spice mixture onto both sides of steaks to lightly coat, pressing to adhere.
Grill steaks in 2 batches on an oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals 4 to 5 minutes on each side, or until an instant-read thermometer inserted horizontally 2 inches into thickest part of meat registers 130°F for medium-rare. Transfer steaks to a platter and let stand 10 minutes.

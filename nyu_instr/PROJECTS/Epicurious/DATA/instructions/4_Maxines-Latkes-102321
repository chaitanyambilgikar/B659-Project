Grate the potatoes and onions by hand, using the large holes of a box grater. Place the grated potatoes and onions in a dish towel and wring out the excess liquid. Set aside. In a large bowl, combine the eggs, bread crumbs, salt, baking powder, and pepper. Stir in the potatoes and onions and mix well. Heat schmaltz and/or vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Drop the mixture by spoonfuls into the pan. Flatten latkes slightly while cooking, and turn only once. Remove from the pan when latkes are crisp and golden. Serve hot with apple sauce or sour cream.

In a large sieve lined with a double thickness of rinsed and squeezed cheesecloth and set over a bowl let the yogurt drain, covered and chilled, for 8 hours. Transfer the yogurt cheese to a bowl, discarding the liquid, and stir in the cucumber, the radish, the coriander, and salt to taste. Spoon about 1 tablespoon of the cheese mixture onto each lettuce leaf. (Do not combine the cheese and the vegetables more than 1 hour in advance or the mixture will become watery.)

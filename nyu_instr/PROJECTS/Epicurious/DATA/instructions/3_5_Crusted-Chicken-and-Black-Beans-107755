1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease a 2 1/2-quart casserole and set aside.
2. Remove and discard the skin and bones from the chicken, shred the meat, and place in a large mixing bowl. Add the tomato, beans, salsa, about three-quarters of the cheese, the cilantro, and cumin, season with salt and pepper, stir till well blended, and scrape into the prepared casserole. Arrange the tortilla quarters overlapping each other over the top, sprinkle with the oil, cover, and bake for 30 minutes.
3. Uncover, sprinkle the remaining cheese evenly over the top, and bake till the top is golden and crusty, 10 to 15 minutes.

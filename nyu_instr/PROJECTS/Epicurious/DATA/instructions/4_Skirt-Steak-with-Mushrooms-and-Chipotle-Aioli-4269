Make aioli: Whisk all ingredients in small bowl to blend. Season dressing to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
Make steak: Whisk first 6 ingredients to blend in 13x9x2-inch glass baking dish. Add steaks to marinade; turn to coat. Cover and refrigerate at least 8 hours.
Make salad: Combine onions, lemon juice and coarse salt in medium bowl. Let stand 1 hour, tossing occasionally.
Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Remove steaks from marinade. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill about 3 minutes per side for medium-rare. Transfer steaks to work surface.
Melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add shallot and mushrooms; sauté until well browned, about 7 minutes. Add vinegar to skillet and bring to boil, scraping up browned bits. Remove from heat; mix in oil. Season mushroom mixture to taste with salt and pepper.
Combine lettuces, onions and mushroom mixture in large bowl; toss. Divide lettuce mixture among 6 plates. Thinly slice steaks across grain; arrange atop lettuce mixture. Drizzle some of aioli over salads. Pass remaining aioli separately.

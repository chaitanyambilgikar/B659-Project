1. Preheat the oven to 350 °F (180 °C), and prepare 12 muffin cups with papers or cooking spray.
2. In a large bowl, mix together the egg, molasses, buttermilk, flax, and salt, and add the dates to the batter.
3. In a separate bowl, mix together the flour and baking soda (and cinnamon).
4. Gently stir the flour mixture (and orange rind and vanilla) into the egg mixture.
5. Fill the muffin cups 2/3 full. Bake for 18 to 20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean.

Preheat oven to 375°F. Butter 2-quart soufflé dish. Bring first 6 ingredients to boil in heavy large saucepan. Gradually add cornmeal, whisking until smooth. Reduce heat to low; cook until cornmeal is very soft and mixture is thick and creamy, stirring occasionally, about 12 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in 6 tablespoons Parmesan cheese. Season with pepper.
Transfer to prepared dish. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons Parmesan over polenta. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cool. Cover and chill.)
Bake polenta until heated through and golden on top, about 30 minutes.

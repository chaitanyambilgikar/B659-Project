Put the eggs in a heavy saucepan that will just hold them in one layer, cover them with cold water by 1 inch, and bring to a boil over high heat. The moment the water boils, remove the pan from the heat, cover it, and let stand 10 minutes. Then immediately cool the eggs under cold running water. If the water is not cold, add some ice.
Peel the eggs, slice them lengthwise, and scoop out the yolk. Put the yolks in a bowl and mix with the sour cream, powdered mustard, Dijon mustard, and hot sauce until smooth. Taste for salt.
Put the mixture back in the egg whites and put the egg halves on plates with the flat side down.
Mix the mayonnaise and the Pickapeppa sauce together, and spoon over the eggs to "nap" them. Garnish the eggs and plates with the chives.

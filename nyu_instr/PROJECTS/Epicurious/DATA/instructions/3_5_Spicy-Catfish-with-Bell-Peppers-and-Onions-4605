Season fish with salt and pepper. Dust lightly with flour. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add fish to skillet. Cook until golden brown and just opaque in center, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer fish to plates. Add 1/2 tablespoon oil, onion and bell peppers to same skillet. Sauté until crisp-tender, about 4 minutes. Add vinegar and jalapeño. Stir 1 minute. Season mixture with salt and pepper. Spoon over fish.

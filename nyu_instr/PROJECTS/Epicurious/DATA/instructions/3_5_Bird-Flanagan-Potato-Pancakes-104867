Peel and grate raw potato; place in a bowl. Beat egg, and add to the potato.
Slice the raw lean bacon into thin strips (julienne). Add to the potatoes along with the diced onion, parsley, pepper, and cheddar. Combine thoroughly.
In a crepe pan, heat oil over medium-high heat. Pour the mix onto the pan. Cook on both sides, until golden brown.

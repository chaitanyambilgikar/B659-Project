For cake: Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter and flour two 9-inch-diameter cake pans with 2-inch-high sides. Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt in medium bowl to blend. Whisk buttermilk and sour cream in small bowl. Using electric mixer, beat butter in large bowl until fluffy. Gradually beat in sugar. Beat in cream of coconut, egg yolks, and vanilla. Beat in dry ingredients in 3 additions, alternating with buttermilk mixture in 2 additions. Beat egg whites in another large bowl until stiff but not dry. Fold into batter.
Divide batter between prepared pans. Bake cakes until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Cool cakes in pans on rack 10 minutes. Turn cakes out onto rack; cool completely. Maintain oven temperature.
Spread flaked coconut on large baking sheet. Bake until lightly toasted, stirring once, about 14 minutes. Cool. (Cakes and coconut can be made 1 day ahead. Cover separately with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature.)
For filling: Stir preserves in small saucepan over medium-low heat until melted. Cool slightly. Toss peaches, sugar, and lemon juice in large bowl. Add preserves and toss to combine.
For frosting: Beat first 3 ingredients in large bowl until peaks form.
Drain peach filling of excess juices. Cut cakes horizontally in half. Place 1 cake layer, cut side up, on platter. Top with 1/3 of peach filling. Spread 1 cup frosting over filling. Repeat layering 2 more times, then top with final cake layer, cut side down. Spread top and sides of cake with remaining frosting. Cover cake completely with toasted coconut. Refrigerate at least 30 minutes and up to 1 day. Fan peach slices atop center of cake before serving.
* Cream of coconut is available in the liquor section of most supermarkets.

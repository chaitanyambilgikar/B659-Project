Place the rice and water in a heavy pot and bring to a boil. Let boil vigorously for several minutes, stirring frequently, then cover, lower the heat to medium, and cook for 10 minutes. Lower the heat to very low and let simmer, still covered, for about 30 minutes.
Just before the rice finishes cooking, place the coconut milk in a saucepan over medium heat and stir in the sugar and salt until completely dissolved. Heat just to a boil, then reduce to the lowest heat until the rice is cooked.
Add the coconut milk to the rice and stir well, then remove from the heat and set aside for 10 minutes, or as long as 2 hours.
Serve warm or at room temperature, in small bowls, with your choice of topping.
Note: If you like, once the pudding has cooled (or if you have leftover pudding), transfer it to a small baking sheet or a baking pan and use a spatula to smooth the surface. Cover and place it in the refrigerator for several hours, or overnight, to firm up. Cut into strips and serve sprinkled, if you wish, with the sesame seeds, coriander, or fried shallots, or a combination, or topped with the fruit.

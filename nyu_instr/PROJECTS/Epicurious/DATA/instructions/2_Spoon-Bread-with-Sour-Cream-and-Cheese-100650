Preheat oven to 375°F. and grease a 1-quart baking dish.
Chop onion and finely chop garlic. In a large bowl whisk together cornmeal, baking powder, salt, onion, and garlic. In a saucepan bring milk to a bare simmer over moderate heat and add in a slow stream to cornmeal mixture, whisking. Cool mixture 5 minutes.
In a small bowl whisk eggs lightly and add to warm cornmeal mixture in a slow stream, whisking. Whisk in butter until melted and transfer mixture to baking dish. Stir sour cream well and gently drop by spoonfuls evenly on batter, letting it sink in. Sprinkle Cheddar evenly over batter and bake spoon bread in middle of oven 40 minutes, or until a knife inserted in center comes out clean.
Serve spoon bread immediately.

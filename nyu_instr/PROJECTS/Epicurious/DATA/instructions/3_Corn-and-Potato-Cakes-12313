Peel the potatoes, grate them coarse, and squeeze them with the bell pepper between several thicknesses of paper towels to remove any excess moisture. In a bowl toss together the potato and pepper mixture, the corn, the scallions, the cumin, the flour, and salt and pepper to taste.
In a non-stick skillet measuring 6 inches across the bottom heat 1/2 tablespoon of the butter over moderate heat until the foam subsides, add 3/4 cup of the corn mixture, tamping it down with a spatula, and cook the corn and potato cake for 6 minutes, or until the underside is golden and crisp, slide it onto a plate, and keep it warm, covered. Make 3 more corn and potato cakes in the same manner with the remaining batter and corn mixture. Spread 2 of the cakes with the sour cream, arrange the remaining cakes on the sour cream, and cut the corn and potato cakes into wedges.

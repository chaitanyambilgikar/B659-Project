1. Place 4 quarts of water in a large pot. Add the onion, celery, carrots, parsley, bay leaves, salt, and peppercorns. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer for 15 minutes.
2. Add the chicken; return to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer for 15 minutes or until cooked through. Remove from the liquid and cool to room temperature. Remove the skin.
3. Shred the chicken into large pieces. Place in a large bowl.
4. Trim the fennel bulbs and slice lengthwise into strips 1/4-inch wide. Add to chicken with the green beans, tomatoes, capers, olives, parley, and chopped fennel ferns.
5. Season with salt and pepper. Shortly before serving, toss with the vinaigrette to prevent the greens from discoloring.

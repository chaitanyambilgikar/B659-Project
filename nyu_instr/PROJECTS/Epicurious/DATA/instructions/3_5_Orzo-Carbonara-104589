Cook bacon in heavy large saucepan over medium heat until crisp, about 8 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towel and drain. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon drippings from pan. Add butter and cook until butter begins to brown, about 2 minutes; mix in orzo. Add 4 1/2 cups broth; simmer uncovered until orzo is just tender but still firm to bite and broth is absorbed, stirring often, about 8 minutes. Add cream; bring to simmer. Mix in cheese and thyme, then bacon. Season with salt and pepper. Thin with additional broth, if desired.

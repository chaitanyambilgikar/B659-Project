Preheat oven to 450°F.
In a small bowl stir together butter, chili powder, lemon juice, cayenne, salt, and sugar. Rinse and pat hens dry and arrange, skin sides up, on a rack of a broiler pan. Loosen skin near breastbones and rub about 1 teaspoon chili butter under skin of each breast. Rub remaining chili butter on skin and roast hens in middle of oven until juices run clear when fleshy part of a thigh is pierced, about 25 minutes.

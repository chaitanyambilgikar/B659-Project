Flake trout and transfer 2 cups to a food processor, then blend with butter, shallot, dill, lemon juice, hot sauce, and pepper until smooth. Reserve remaining trout.
With motor running, add water to trout purée in a slow stream and process until water is absorbed, about 1 minute. Transfer to a bowl and fold in reserved trout, then pack mixture into a 4-cup glass or ceramic mold or bowl. Cover surface with wax paper, then tightly cover with plastic wrap and chill at least 6 hours to allow flavors to develop. Bring spread to room temperature before serving. (This will take 1 to 2 hours.)

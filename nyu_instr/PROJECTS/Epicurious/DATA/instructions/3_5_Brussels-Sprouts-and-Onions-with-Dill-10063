In a 10-inch heavy skillet heat oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and sauté onions and Brussel sprouts, stirring, until onions begin to turn golden, about 1 1/2 minutes. Add water, sugar and salt and pepper to taste and cook, covered, over moderately low heat until vegetables are just tender, about 3 minutes. If any liquid remains, boil mixture until nearly all liquid is evaporated and stir in minced dill. Garnish vegetables with dill sprigs.

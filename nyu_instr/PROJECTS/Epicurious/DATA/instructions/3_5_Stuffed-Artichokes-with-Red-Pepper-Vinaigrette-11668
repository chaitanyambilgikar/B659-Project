Cut off stems of artichokes with a stainless-steel knife and discard. Break off tough outer leaves and cut off top fourth of artichokes. Snip off tips of leaves with scissors and rub cut edges with lemon half.
In a 4-quart microwave-safe glass bowl with a lid arrange artichokes, bottoms up, and add water. Microwave at high power (100%), covered, 10 minutes, or until bases are tender, and let stand, covered, 5 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375°F.
While artichokes are cooking, in a small heavy saucepan cook 1/4 cup of bell pepper, onion, and garlic in 1 tablespoon of oil over moderately low heat, stirring, until softened. In a bowl stir together vegetables, bread crumbs, scallion, cheese, thyme, cayenne, lemon juice, 1 tablespoon of remaining oil, and salt and pepper to taste.
Pull out centers of artichokes, leaving bases intact, and scrape out chokes with a small spoon. Spread leaves of artichokes gently and stuff each artichoke with some of stuffing, filling centers and spaces between leaves.
Arrange artichokes in a baking dish just large enough to hold them and add enough water to cover bottom of dish. Drizzle 1 tablespoon of remaining oil over artichokes and bake 12 minutes.
In a small bowl whisk together vinegar, remaining tablespoon oil, remaining 2 tablespoons bell pepper, and salt and pepper to taste.
Serve artichokes with vinaigrette spooned around them.

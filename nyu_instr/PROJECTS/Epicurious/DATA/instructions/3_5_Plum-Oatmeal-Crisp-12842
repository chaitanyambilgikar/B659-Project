In a bowl stir together the plums, the lemon juice, and the granulated sugar and spread the mixture evenly in the bottom of an buttered 8-inch-square pan. In another bowl blend the brown sugar, the flour, the oats, the salt, the cinnamon, the ginger, the walnuts, and the butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Sprinkle the brown sugar mixture evenly over the plum mixture and bake the dessert in the middle of a preheated 375°F. oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until it is crisp. (For a crisper topping, after baking the crisp broil it under a preheated broiler for 2 minutes.) Serve the crisp warm with the vanilla ice cream.

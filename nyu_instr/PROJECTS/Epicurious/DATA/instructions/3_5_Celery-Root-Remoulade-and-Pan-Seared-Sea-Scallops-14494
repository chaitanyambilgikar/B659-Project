Make sauce: In a bowl stir together sauce ingredients and season with salt and pepper. (Sauce may be made 2 days ahead and chilled, covered.)
With a sharp knife peel celery root and cut into thin matchsticks. Add celery root to sauce with salt and pepper to taste and toss.
Remove tough muscle from side of each scallop if necessary and pat scallops dry. Season scallops with salt and pepper.
In a large non-stick skillet heat oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and sauté scallops in batches with out crowding, turning them once, until golden and just cooked through, about 2 minutes on each side. Transfer scallops as sautéed with tongs to a plate.
Mound celery root rémoulade in center of each of 6 plates and arrange scallops around it. Garnish celery root rémoulade and scallops with chives and tarragon.

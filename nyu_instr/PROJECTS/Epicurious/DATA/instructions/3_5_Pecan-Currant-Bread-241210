Preheat oven to 325°F with rack in middle.
Whisk together dry ingredients, pecans, and currants in a large bowl. In another bowl, whisk together remaining ingredients until combined well.
Stir wet ingredients into dry ingredients until just combined. Transfer batter to a well-buttered 9- by 5-inch loaf pan, smoothing top, and bake until golden-brown and a wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean, about 1 1/4 hours.
Cool in pan on a rack 10 minutes, then turn out onto rack and cool 1 hour more.

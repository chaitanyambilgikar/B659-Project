Melt butter in heavy large saucepan over medium heat. Add onions, sugar and pinch of salt. Cover pan and cook until onions are very soft, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes. Increase heat to high and sauté uncovered until onions are golden brown, about 10 minutes. Add flour and stir 2 minutes. Mix in chicken and beef broths, wine, brandy and mustard. Bring soup to boil, stirring frequently. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover and simmer 10 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Rewarm before continuing.)
Preheat broiler. Ladle soup into deep broilerproof bowls. Top soup with bread slices, then cheese. Broil until cheese melts and begins to brown.

Sprinkle turkey with half the sage, salt, and pepper. Melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add 4 turkey scallops and sauté until lightly browned and cooked through, about 1 1/2 minutes per side. Transfer to plate. Repeat with remaining 4 scallops. Add green onions to skillet and sauté 1 minute. Sprinkle with flour; stir 1 minute. Gradually mix in broth and Sherry. Increase heat to high and boil until gravy thickens, whisking constantly, about 2 minutes. Add remaining half of sage. Reduce heat to low. Return turkey and any accumulated juices to gravy; simmer 1 minute to heat through. Season with salt and pepper.
Place 1 bread slice on each plate. Top each with 2 turkey scallops and gravy.

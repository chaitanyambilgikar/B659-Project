Make the dressing: In a blender blend together the garlic paste, the anchovy, the vinegar, the lemon juice, the mustard, and salt and pepper to taste. With the motor running add the oil in a stream and blend the dressing well.
In a large bowl combine the escarole, the spinach, the onion, and the dressing and toss the salad until it is combined well.

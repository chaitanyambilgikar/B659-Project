In a bowl combine well the lobster, the radishes, the scallion, the celery, the parsley, the mayonnaise, the lemon juice, the Tabasco, and salt and pepper to taste. Halve the eggs crosswise and remove the yolks. Chop 1 of the yolks, reserving the other 2 for another use, and stir it into the lobster salad. Divide the romaine and the cabbage between 2 salad plates, forming nests, fill the whites with the lobster salad, and arrange the eggs in the nests.

1. While the turkey rests, prepare gravy. Discard the foil from the roasting pan along with any solids. Heat the pan juices in the roasting pan. Skim the fat off with a metal spoon. Pour defatted juices into a measuring cup; add extra broth to make 2 cups.
2. Melt butter in a heavy saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and continue whisking until it browns slightly, 2 to 3 minutes. Whisking constantly, slowly pour in the broth and continue whisking until the gravy thickens. Season with thyme, salt, and pepper.

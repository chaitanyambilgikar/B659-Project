Mix butter, cheese, parsley and garlic in medium bowl to blend well. Season with pepper. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Bring to room temperature before using.)
Preheat oven to 500°F. Place bread, cut side up, on baking sheet. Spread butter mixture evenly over cut sides of bread. Bake until topping is golden brown and bread is heated through, about 5 minutes.
Cut bread crosswise into 2-inch-wide pieces. Serve immediately.

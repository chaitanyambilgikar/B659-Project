Dredge pork in flour to coat; shake off excess. Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Working in batches, add pork and brown on all sides, about 8 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer pork to large bowl.
Add remaining 1/4 cup olive oil to same pot. Add onion and sauté until translucent, about 4 minutes. Add poblano chilies and garlic and sauté 2 minutes. Mix in pork, diced tomatoes with their juice, enchilada sauce, ale, diced green chilies, cumin and chili powder. Simmer until meat is tender and chili thickens slightly, stirring occasionally, about 1 hour. Serve chili with sour cream and sliced green onions.

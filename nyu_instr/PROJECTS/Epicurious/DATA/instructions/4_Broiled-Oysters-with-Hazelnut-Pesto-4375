Combine basil, hazelnuts, breadcrumbs, cheese, 1/4 cup water, lemon juice and garlic in processor. Blend until mixture is finely chopped. Add butter and process until smooth paste forms. Season pesto to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Bring to room temperature before continuing.)
Preheat broiler. Arrange oysters in half shells on 2 large baking sheets. Top each oyster with 1 1/2 teaspoons pesto. Working in batches, broil until pesto begins to brown, about 1 1/2 minutes. Place 3 oysters on each plate and serve.

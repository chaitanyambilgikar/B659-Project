Sprinkle veal with salt and pepper. Melt 3 tablespoons butter in heavy large pot over high heat. Add veal and brown on all sides, turning occasionally, about 10 minutes. Transfer veal to plate. Add onion, carrot, bay leaf, thyme, and garlic to pot. Reduce heat to medium-high; sauté until vegetables just soften, about 5 minutes. Place chops on vegetables; add any juices from plate, then stock. Reduce heat to medium. Cover and simmer 10 minutes. Turn chops over. Cover and cook to desired doneness, about 25 minutes longer for medium-rare (145°F to 150°F). Place veal on plate; tent with oil.
Spoon fat off top of veal-braising liquid. Press liquid and solids through strainer set over bowl to make puree; return puree to pot. Bring to boil. Whisk in remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Simmer until sauce coats spoon lightly, about 2 minutes; season with salt and pepper.
Cut veal chops horizontally in half. Set on plates. Spoon sauce over and serve.

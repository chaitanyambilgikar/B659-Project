Bring brown sugar, butter, broth, water, and salt to a boil in a 10-inch heavy skillet, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Add carrots and simmer, covered, until just tender, 4 to 5 minutes.
Transfer carrots with a slotted spoon to a bowl and boil liquid until reduced to a glaze (about 1 1/2 tablespoons). Return carrots to skillet and cook over low heat, stirring, until heated through and coated with glaze. Stir in lemon juice and parsley and season with salt and pepper.

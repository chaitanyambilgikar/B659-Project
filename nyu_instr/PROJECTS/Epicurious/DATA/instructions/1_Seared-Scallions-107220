Trim roots from scallions, leaving ends intact, and remove any bruised outer leaves. Trim greens, leaving an 8-inch length of white and green parts.
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 10-inch heavy skillet (preferably cast-iron) over moderate heat until hot but not smoking, then add half of scallions. Sprinkle with sea salt and cook, turning over once, until scallions are golden brown, 4 to 6 minutes total. (If greens become too brown before white parts are browned, prop greens up along side of skillet.) Transfer seared scallions to a plate and keep warm, covered. Cook remaining scallions in same manner, adding more oil as needed.

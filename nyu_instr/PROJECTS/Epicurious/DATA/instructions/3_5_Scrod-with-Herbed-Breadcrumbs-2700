Melt 1/4 cup butter in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add minced shallots and cook 1 minute. Add breadcrumbs and stir until butter is absorbed. Remove from heat and add chives, parsley and lemon peel. Season to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Bring to room temperature before using.)
Preheat oven to 450°F. Butter baking pan and place fish in pan. Brush lemon juice over fish. Cover with breadcrumb mixture, pressing to adhere. Bake until fish is just cooked through, about 20 minutes. Serve with lemon wedges.

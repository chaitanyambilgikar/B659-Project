Mix graham cracker crumbs, 1/4 cup sugar and brown sugar in medium bowl. Add butter and stir until blended. Press mixture onto bottom and up sides of 9-inch-diameter glass pie pan. Refrigerate while preparing filling.
Beat cream cheese, peanut butter, vanilla, and remaining 3/4 cup sugar in large bowl until smooth. Using electric mixer with clean dry beaters, beat cream in another large bowl until stiff peaks form. Gently fold whipped cream into peanut butter mixture in 4 additions. Spoon filling into prepared crust, mounding in center. Freeze until firm, about 2 hours. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and keep frozen.)
Warm hot fudge sauce according to package directions, if desired. Cut pie into wedges; serve with hot fudge sauce.

In a bowl combine well the crumbs, the sugar, the salt, and the butter and, reserving 1 cup of the mixture, press the remaining mixture into the bottom of a flameproof baking dish, 13 by 9 by 2 inches. Bake the crust in a preheated 350°F. oven for 12 minutes, or until it is golden, and let it cool in the dish on a rack. In a metal bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water melt the chocolate, stirring, pour it over the crust spreading it evenly, and sprinkle it with the marshmallows, pressing them lightly, and the reserved crumb mixture. Broil the dessert under a preheated broiler about 2 inches from the heat for 30 seconds, or until the marshmallows are golden, let it cool completely, and cut it into squares.

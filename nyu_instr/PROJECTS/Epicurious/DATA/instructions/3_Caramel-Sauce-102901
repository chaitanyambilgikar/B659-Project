Stir sugar, 2 tablespoons water and corn syrup in heavy medium saucepan over medium-low heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat; boil without stirring until syrup turns deep amber, brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush and swirling pan occasionally, about 8 minutes. Remove from heat. Whisk in cream, butter and vanilla (mixture will bubble vigorously). Place pan over low heat and stir until sauce thickens slightly, about 2 minutes. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Rewarm over medium-low heat before serving.)

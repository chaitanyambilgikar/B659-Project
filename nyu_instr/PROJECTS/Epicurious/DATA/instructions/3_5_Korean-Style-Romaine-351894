Cut romaine crosswise into 2-inch pieces and put in a bowl.
Cook garlic, ginger, and red-pepper flakes in sesame oil in a small heavy skillet over medium-low heat, stirring, until garlic begins to sizzle, about 30 seconds. Stir in soy sauce and water and bring to a boil.
Pour hot dressing over romaine and toss to coat. Sprinkle with sesame seeds. Marinate, stirring occasionally, at least 30 minutes.

With a mandoline or knife cut the potatoes into 1/16-inch slices and pat them dry with paper towels. In a deep fryer heat enough shortening to measure 2 inches to 380°F. and in it fry the potato slices in batches, turning them, until they are golden brown. Transfer the chips with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain and sprinkle them with the salt.

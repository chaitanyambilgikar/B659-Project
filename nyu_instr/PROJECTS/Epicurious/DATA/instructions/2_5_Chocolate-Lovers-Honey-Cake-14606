Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and grease a 9- by 5-inch loaf pan. Melt the unsweetened chocolate over simmering water in a double boiler or microwave for 1 minute. Set aside.
Sift into a mixing bowl the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and cinnamon and set aside.
In a large bowl, beat the eggs and add the oil and honey. Then add the brown sugar and melted chocolate.
Alternately mix in the dry ingredients and the orange juice. Stir in 3/4 cup of the chocolate chips.
Pour the batter into the loaf pan. Sprinkle the remaining 1/4 cup chocolate chips over the top.
Bake on the lower rack of the oven for 50-55 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool on a rack for about 15 minutes. Gently run a knife around the edges to loosen the cake, then remove it from the pan.

Squeeze 1 lemon half into large bowl of cold water. Working with 1 artichoke at a time, trim all but 1 inch from artichoke stem. Break off all dark green leaves from artichoke until only pale green leaves remain. Using large serrated knife, cut off top 2/3 of leaves from artichoke. Rub cut edges with other lemon half. Using paring knife, trim any dark green parts from outer heart and stem. Quarter artichoke through stem. Using spoon, scrape out fuzzy choke. Thinly slice artichoke heart and place in bowl of lemon water. Repeat with remaining artichokes.
Place chicken breasts between 2 sheets of plastic wrap. Using mallet, pound to 1/2- to 1/3-inch thickness. Whisk flour, salt, and pepper in small bowl. Dredge chicken breasts in flour mixture; shake to remove excess. Place on plate.
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add 3 chicken breasts and cook until golden brown and just cooked through, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to another plate. Repeat with 1 tablespoon oil and remaining chicken breasts.
Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil to same skillet. Add shallots; sauté until beginning to soften, about 1 minute. Drain artichokes; add to skillet and sauté until beginning to soften, about 3 minutes. Add wine to skillet and simmer until wine is almost absorbed, scraping up any browned bits, about 1 minute. Add chicken broth and 4 teaspoons tarragon; cover and simmer until artichoke hearts are tender, about 5 minutes. Season sauce with salt and pepper. Return chicken breasts with any accumulated juices to skillet. Gently toss to combine. Remove skillet from heat. Add butter and stir gently until butter is melted. Transfer to platter. Sprinkle with additional tarragon and serve.

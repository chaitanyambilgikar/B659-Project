Preheat oven to 500°F. In medium bowl, whisk together butter and mustard. In large bowl, toss together panko and thyme.
Season rabbit pieces with salt and pepper. Using pastry brush, brush 1 piece generously with mustard mixture, then dip in panko mixture and toss to coat. Transfer to large rimmed baking sheet. Repeat with remaining pieces, using 2 baking sheets. Drizzle pieces with olive oil.
Bake 15 minutes, then reduce heat to 350°F. Bake until crust is golden and juices run clear when meat is pricked with fork, about 10 minutes more.

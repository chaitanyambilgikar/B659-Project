For the Shrimp: If necessary, pat shrimp dry, then thread about 6 shrimp (through top and tail, leaving shrimp curled), onto each skewer, without leaving space between shrimp.
Prepare grill for direct-heat cooking over medium-hot charcoal (medium-high for gas); see Grilling Procedure.
Meanwhile, brush shrimp with vegetable oil and sprinkle evenly with salt.
Lightly oil grill rack. Grill shrimp, covered only if using a gas grill, turning over once, 2 minutes. Brush shrimp with some sauce from the saucepan, then turn. Brush shrimp with additional sauce then grill until just cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve with reserved sauce.

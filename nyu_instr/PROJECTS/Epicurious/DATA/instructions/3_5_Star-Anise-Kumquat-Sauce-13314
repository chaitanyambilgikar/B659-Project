In a saucepan bring the water and the sake or vermouth to a boil with the sugar, the star anise, and a pinch of salt and boil the mixture for 5 minutes. Stir in the kumquats and simmer the mixture for 5 minutes, or until it is thickened. Discard the star anise, chill the sauce until it is cold, and serve it with ice cream, yogurt, or pound cake. The sauce keeps, covered and chilled, for 1 week.

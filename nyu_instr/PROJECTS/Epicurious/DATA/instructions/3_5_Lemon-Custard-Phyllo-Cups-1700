For Custard: Whisk sugar, cornstarch and salt in heavy medium saucepan to blend. Gradually whisk in 1 cup cold water and lemon juice. Whisk until sugar and cornstarch dissolve. Whisk in egg and lemon peel. Add butter. Whisk over medium heat until mixture boils and thickens, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in food coloring. Transfer custard to bowl. Press plastic onto surface of custard and cool to room temperature.
For Phyllo Cups: Preheat oven to 375°F. Lightly spray eight 1/3-cup muffin cups with vegetable oil spray. Stack 4 phyllo sheets into six 4-inch squares, forming total of 24 squares. Press 1 phyllo square into each cup (cover remaining phyllo with plastic wrap and damp towel). Using pastry brush, dab phyllo in a few places with melted butter. Press another phyllo square atop first phyllo square, with corners at different angles. Sprinkle phyllo cups with sugar.
Bake until phyllo is golden brown, about 6 minutes. Transfer pan to rack and cool cups from muffin tin. (Custard and phyllo cups can be prepared 1 day ahead. Refrigerate custard. Store phyllo cups in airtight containers.)
Spoon some of custard into each of 4 cups (save remaining custard and cups for another use). Sift powdered sugar over edges of phyllo. Garnish with mint sprigs. Arrange on plates.

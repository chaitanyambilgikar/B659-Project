Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 400°F.
Combine berries, liqueur, vanilla, 2 tablespoons sugar, and a pinch of salt in a bowl and let macerate at room temperature, stirring occasionally, 20 minutes.
While berries macerate, cut out 8 rounds from bread using cookie cutter, then roll each round with a rolling pin, pressing firmly, into a flat 3 1/4-inch round. Generously brush muffin cups with some butter and press bread rounds onto bottom and up side of cups. Brush with remaining butter and toast until bottoms are golden, about 10 minutes.
While bread cups toast, beat cream with remaining tablespoon sugar using an electric mixer at high speed until it just holds soft peaks.
Transfer 2 toast cups to each of 4 plates, then divide berry mixture among toast cups and top with whipped cream and any leftover liquid from berries.

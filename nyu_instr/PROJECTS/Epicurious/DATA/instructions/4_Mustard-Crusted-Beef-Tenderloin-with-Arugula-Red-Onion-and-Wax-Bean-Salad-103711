Prepare beef: Preheat oven to 425°F.
Stir together mustards, brown sugar, pepper, and lemon zest.
Pat beef dry and season generously with salt. Heat oil in a heavy skillet over moderately high heat until just beginning to smoke, then brown beef on all sides, about 2 minutes total.
Transfer to an oiled shallow baking pan and coat with mustard mixture.
Roast beef in middle of oven until a thermometer inserted 2 inches into thickest part of meat registers 125°F for medium-rare, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and let stand until cool, at least 45 minutes.
Prepare salad while beef is roasting: Chill onion slices in water to cover 30 minutes. Cook beans in boiling salted water until crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Drain beans in a colander and rinse under cold water to stop cooking, then transfer to a large bowl. Add arugula to beans. Drain onion slices and pat dry.
Make dressing and toss salad: Whisk together vinegar, lemon juice, mustard, and salt and pepper to taste. Add oil in a slow stream, whisking until emulsified.
Cut beef into thin slices.
Add onion slices, beef, and enough dressing to arugula and beans to just coat and toss to combine well.

Sprinkle fish fillets generously on all sides with coarse salt; let stand 30 minutes. Rinse fish to remove salt and pat dry with paper towels.
Place eggs and matzo meal in separate large shallow bowls. Mix chili powder, cumin, black pepper and 1/2 teaspoon coarse salt in small bowl to blend. Sprinkle fish generously with chili powder mixture. Dip fish into eggs, then into matzo meal, coating completely. Transfer fish to waxed paper.
Heat 1/4 cup oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Working in batches, fry fish in single layer until just opaque in center and golden brown, adding more oil if necessary, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer fish to paper towels and drain.
Arrange fish on platter. Garnish with lemon wedges and cilantro sprigs.

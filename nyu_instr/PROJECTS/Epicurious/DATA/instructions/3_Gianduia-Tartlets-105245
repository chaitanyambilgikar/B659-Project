Preheat oven to 350° F.
Form dough into twenty-five 1 1/2-inch balls. Put each ball into a 2 1/2- by 1-inch fluted mold. Press dough against bottoms and sides of molds to form even 1/8-inch-thick shells and trim any overhang. Arrange molds in a baking pan and chill while making filling.
Make filling: Chop chocolates into small pieces and melt in a double boiler or a metal bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water, stirring until smooth. Remove top of double boiler or bowl from heat and stir in hazelnut butter until combined well.
In a large bowl with an electric mixer beat together butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add whole egg and milk and beat well. Add chocolate mixture and at low speed beat until just combined (mixture will thicken slightly).
Spoon about 1 1/2 tablespoons filling into each shell and bake tartlets in baking pan in middle of oven 20 to 25 minutes, or until filling is set and pastry is golden. Cool tartlets in molds on a rack until cool enough to handle and with tip of a small knife gently remove tartlets from molds. Tartlets keep, in one layer in airtight containers at room temperature, 3 days.

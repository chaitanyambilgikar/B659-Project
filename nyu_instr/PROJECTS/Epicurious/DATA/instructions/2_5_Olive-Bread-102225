1. Preheat the oven to 400°F (205°C). Butter an 8 1/2x4 1/2x 2 1/2-inch 21x11 1/2x 6 1/2 cm) loaf pan. Line it with parchment paper, lightly butter the paper, and dust it with flour.
2. Sift the flour, salt, and baking powder together onto a piece of waxed paper.
3. Coarsely chop the roasted pepper and the olives.
4. Mince the basil leaves.
5. In a large bowl, whisk the eggs. Then add the oil and the basil, and whisk until combined. Add the garlic. Then whisk in the flour mixture just until combined. Grind black pepper to taste over the batter and whisk it in. Then whisk in the cheese. Fold in the olives and the roasted pepper.
6. Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and rap the pan once, hard, on a work surface to release any air bubbles. Bake the cake in the center of the oven until the top is golden and springs back when touched, about 45 minutes.

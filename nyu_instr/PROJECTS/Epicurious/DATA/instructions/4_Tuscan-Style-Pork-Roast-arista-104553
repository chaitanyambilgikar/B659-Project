Mince together garlic and rosemary. Stir together with sea salt in a small bowl and season with pepper. Rub 1 tablespoon garlic mixture all over pork. Beginning at 1 end of loin, make a 3/4-inch slit with a long thin knife through center of loin to other end. Stuff slit with remaining garlic mixture, pushing it through with handle of a long wooden spoon. Marinate at room temperature 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350°F.
Put loin, fat side up, on a rack in a roasting pan and roast in middle of oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted diagonally at least 2 inches into meat registers 155°F, about 2 hours. Let pork stand, loosely covered, 20 minutes.
Discard string. Separate loin from bones and cut meat crosswise into 3/4-inch-thick slices. If desired, serve bones cut into ribs.

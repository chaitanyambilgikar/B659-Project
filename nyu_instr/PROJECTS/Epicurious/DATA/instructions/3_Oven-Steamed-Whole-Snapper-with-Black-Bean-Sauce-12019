Preheat oven to 450°F.
Rinse snappers and pat dry with paper towels. Cut 3 slashes about 1/2 inch deep on each side of fish and rub gingerroot, garlic, and salt to taste into slashes. Arrange fish in one layer in a 13- by 9-inch baking dish and drizzle on both sides with Sherry and soy sauce. Sprinkle mushrooms, carrots, scallions, and black beans over fish and cover dish tightly with foil.
Bake fish in middle of oven 40 minutes, or until just cooked through. Gently push black bean mixture off fish. Transfer fish to platter with large metal spatulas and keep warm.
Transfer black bean mixture and pan juices to a saucepan. In a small bowl stir together water and cornstarch and stir into black bean mixture. Simmer sauce 1 minute, or until thickened slightly, and pour over fish.
Serve fish with rice.

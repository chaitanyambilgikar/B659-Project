Make dressing: Whisk together dressing ingredients.
Make slaw: Heat vegetable oil in a large heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then sauté carrots, stirring, until almost tender but not brown, about 2 minutes. Add cabbage and sauté, stirring and tossing constantly, until wilted but still crisp-tender, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat and add cucumber and dressing, tossing well to coat.

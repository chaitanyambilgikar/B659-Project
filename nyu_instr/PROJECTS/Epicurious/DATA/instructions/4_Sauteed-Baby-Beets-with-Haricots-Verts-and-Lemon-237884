Preheat oven to 375°F. Toss beets with oil in roasting pan. Sprinkle with salt. Cover pan with foil. Bake until beets are tender, about 30 minutes. Uncover and let beets stand at room temperature 20 minutes. Peel beets. Cut beets into quarters (or halves if very small).
Cook haricots verts in large pot of boiling salted water until crisp-tender, about 4 minutes. Drain and transfer to bowl of ice water to cool. Drain and pat dry. Melt butter in large skillet over medium heat. Add lemon juice and peel, then beets. Toss well. Stir in haricots verts and parsley; sauté until heated through, about 3 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve hot or at room temperature.

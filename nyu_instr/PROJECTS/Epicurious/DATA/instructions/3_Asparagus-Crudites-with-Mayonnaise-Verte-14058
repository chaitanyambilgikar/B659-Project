Have ready a large bowl of ice and cold water. In a large saucepan of boiling salted water blanch asparagus 1 minute and transfer with tongs to ice water to stop cooking. Drain asparagus well in a colander and pat dry. Asparagus may be blanched 1 day ahead and chilled in a sealable plastic bag.
Wash and dry parsley and in a blender purée with oil, verjus or lemon juice, and mustard until smooth. Stir purée into mayonnaise and season with salt and pepper.
Serve mayonnaise with asparagus for dipping.
*Verjus is available at some specialty food shops and by mail order from Dean and DeLuca. Call 212-226-6800 ext. 268

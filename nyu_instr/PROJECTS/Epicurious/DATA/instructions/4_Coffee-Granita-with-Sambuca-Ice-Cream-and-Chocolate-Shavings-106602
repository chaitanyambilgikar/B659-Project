Stir together coffee and granulated sugar until sugar is dissolved, then chill until cold, about 1 hour.
Pour into an 8- to 9-inch baking pan (1 1/2- to 2-quart capacity) and freeze, stirring and crushing lumps with a fork every 30 minutes, until evenly frozen, about 4 hours. Scrape with fork to lighten texture.
Beat cream with confectioners sugar and Sambuca (to taste) in a bowl with an electric mixer until it just holds soft peaks. Spoon Sambuca cream into 8 glasses and top each serving with a scant cup of granita (do not pack when measuring). Sprinkle with chocolate shavings.

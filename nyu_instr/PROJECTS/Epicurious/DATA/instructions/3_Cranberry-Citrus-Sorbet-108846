Bring all ingredients to simmer in heavy medium pot over medium-high heat. Cook until sugar is dissolved and mixture is heated through, about 5 minutes. Transfer mixture to 9x13-inch metal baking pan. Place pan in freezer. Freeze for 3 hours, stirring with spoon every hour to break up ice crystals. Scoop mixture into chilled bowls and serve.

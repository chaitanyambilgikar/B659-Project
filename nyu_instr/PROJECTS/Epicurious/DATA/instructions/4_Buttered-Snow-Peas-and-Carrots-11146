In a large saucepan of boiling water cook the carrots for 3 minutes, or until they are crisp-tender. Add the snow peas, cook the vegetables for 30 seconds, and drain them well. Return the vegetables to the pan, add the butter and salt and pepper to taste, and heat the vegetables over moderately low heat, stirring, until the butter is melted.

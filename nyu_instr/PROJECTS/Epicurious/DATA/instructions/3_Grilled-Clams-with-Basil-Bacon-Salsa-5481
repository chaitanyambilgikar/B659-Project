Cook 5 bacon slices in medium skillet over medium heat until almost crisp, turning occasionally, about 10 minutes. Transfer to paper towels. Repeat with remaining 5 bacon slices. Chop bacon.
Mix salsa and basil in medium bowl.
Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Cover bottom of 2 platters with 1/4-inch-thick layer of rock salt. Arrange clams directly on barbecue rack. Cover and grill until clams open, turning occasionally, about 8 minutes (discard any clams that do not open). Remove clams from rack.
Using pot holders to protect hands, twist off and discard top shells of clams. Arrange clams, shell side down, atop salt on platters. Spoon salsa atop clams. Sprinkle with reserved bacon and serve.

Stir first 3 ingredients in top of double boiler set over simmering water until smooth. Remove from over water. Whisk in Kahlúa. Cool 15 minutes. Freeze until firm, about 2 hours.
Line baking sheet with foil. Place cocoa powder on plate. Scoop chocolate mixture by very generously mounded teaspoonfuls onto prepared sheet, forming 1-inch mounds. Dust hands with cocoa powder; roll mounds between palms, forming smooth balls, then roll in cocoa powder to coat lightly. Return to sheet. Cover with foil; chill truffles until firm, at least 2 hours. (Can be made ahead. Chill in covered container up to 1 week or freeze up to 1 month.) Let stand at room temperature until slightly softened before serving.

1. Bring the chicken stock and the star anise to a boil in a large saucepan, covered, over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to simmer and cook for 30 minutes. Remove the star anise from the stock and add the chestnuts. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat so the mixture is simmering and cook, covered, until the chestnuts are tender through and falling apart, about 20 minutes.
2. Remove one third of the chestnuts from the soup and reserve. Puree the remaining soup, then add the reserved chestnut pieces and heat the soup until it is hot but not boiling. Adjust the seasoning and ladle the soup into warmed soup bowls. Add 1 tablespoon crème fraîche to each bowl, and garnish each bowl with a star anise. Serve immediately.

Separately cut carrots and bell pepper into thin strips and diagonally cut snow peas into 1/2-inch pieces. Chop coriander. Peel sweet potato and, if desired, with a channel knife cut 4 lengthwise grooves (one every quarter turn). Cut potato crosswise into 12 slices (about 1/4 inch thick) and in a steamer set over 1 inch boiling water steam slices, in one layer if possible, covered, until just cooked through and tender but not falling apart, about 8 minutes.
Remove steamer from heat and season potato with salt and pepper. Keep potato warm in steamer, covered. In a small saucepan heat glaze and keep warm, covered.
Preheat oven to 275°F.
In a non-stick skillet heat 1/2 teaspoon oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and sauté 2 fillets, skin sides down, pressing on fish with a metal spatula to help skin brown evenly, until skin is golden brown, about 1 minute. With spatula turn fillets over and sauté until golden, about 30 seconds more. Transfer fillets, skin sides up, to a non-stick baking pan and sauté remaining 2 fillets in 1/2 teaspoon oil in same manner. Bake fish in middle of oven until just cooked through, about 3 minutes.
While fish is baking, in a large non-stick skillet heat 1/2 teaspoon remaining oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and sauté carrots until barely tender, about 2 minutes. Add remaining 1/2 teaspoon oil, bell pepper, and snow peas and sauté vegetables, stirring, until just tender, about 30 seconds. Add cabbage and onion and sauté, stirring, until just tender, about 1 minute. Immediately transfer sautéed vegetables to a bowl and toss with coriander, vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste.
Divide potato among 4 plates and top with sautéed vegetables. Put fillets, skin sides up, on vegetables and drizzle with some glaze.
Garnish plates with lime wedges and serve remaining glaze on the side.

First you'll make a pastry cream and then fold in both mascarpone and whipped cream.
Prepare the pastry cream: Scald the milk.* Whisk together the egg, egg yolk, flour, and sugar in a small bowl. Slowly pour the scalded milk into the egg mixture while whisking constantly. When all the milk has been incorporated, pour it back into the pan and return to the heat. Bring to a boil while stirring constantly. Cook for 2 minutes to cook out the raw flavor of the flour. Stir in the vanilla beans or vanilla extract. Pass through a sieve to remove any lumps and cover with plastic wrap pressed right down onto the surface of the pastry cream to prevent a skin from forming. Cool.
Make the mascarpone chantilly: In a large bowl, fold together the cooled pastry cream, mascarpone, and whipped cream.
Assemble the gratin: Preheat oven to 450°F. Scatter the berries and diced mango over the bottom of a 9-by-11-inch baking dish with low sides. (Low sides in the pan allow for better browning, because the air current moves easily over the surface of the food.) Spoon the mascarpone chantilly evenly over the berries and mango. Place dish in the hot oven for about 10 minutes, and cook until the berries have popped open a bit and the surface of the gratin has browned. Serve warm from the oven.
*To scald means to bring the milk just up to under a boil so you get a skin on top.

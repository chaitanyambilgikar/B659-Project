In a bowl stir together goat cheese, cream, and salt and pepper to taste until combined and transfer to a pastry bag fitted with a 1/4-inch tip. (Alternatively, transfer mixture to a small heavy-duty sealable plastic bag and press out excess air. Snip off 1 corner, making a small hole.) Cheese mixture may be made 2 days ahead and chilled in bag. Bring cheese mixture to room temperature before proceeding.
Trim radish tops to 1/2 inch and halve radishes lengthwise. Decoratively pipe mixture onto radish halves.
Garnish hors d'oeuvres with chervil.

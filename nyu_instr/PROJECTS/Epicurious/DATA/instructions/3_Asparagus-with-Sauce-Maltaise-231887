Whisk egg yolks, 1/4 cup water, and lemon juice in medium metal bowl to blend. Place bowl over large saucepan of barely simmering water. Whisk constantly until instant-read thermometer inserted into mixture registers 160°F, about 5 minutes. Transfer yolk mixture to blender. With blender running, gradually pour hot melted butter through opening in top of blender and blend until mixture is thick and creamy. Stir in orange peel. Season sauce with salt and pepper.
Meanwhile, cook asparagus in large saucepan of boiling salted water until crisp-tender, about 4 minutes. Drain; divide among plates. Spoon sauce over.

1. Heat the oven to 300°F.
2. Spread the pretzels on a sheet pan and toast for 15 minutes, until the pretzels have slightly darkened in color and your kitchen smells pretzely. Cool completely.
3. Put the pretzels in a large bowl, pour the milk over them, and stir while steeping for 2 minutes.
4. Strain the milk mixture through a fine-mesh sieve and discard the soggy pieces of pretzel.
5. Bloom the gelatin (see note below).
6. Warm a little bit of the pretzel milk and whisk in the gelatin to dissolve. Add the remaining pretzel milk, glucose, brown sugar, cream cheese, salt, and baking soda and whisk until all of the ingredients are fully dissolved and incorporated.
7. Pour the mixture into your ice cream machine and freeze according to the manufacturer's instructions. The ice cream is best spun just before serving or using, but it will keep in an airtight container in the freezer for up to 2 weeks.

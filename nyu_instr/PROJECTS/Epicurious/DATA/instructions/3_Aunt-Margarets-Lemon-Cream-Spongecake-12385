Preheat oven to 350°F. and grease and flour a 7- to 8-inch round cake pan, knocking out excess flour.
In a large bowl with an electric mixer beat 1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon granulated sugar and eggs until thick and pale and beat in vanilla. Into a small bowl sift together flour and cornstarch and fold into egg mixture. Gently fold in butter until combined well.
Pour batter into cake pan and bake in middle of oven 20 minutes, or until a tester comes out clean. Cool cake in pan on a rack 10 minutes and invert onto rack to cool completely.
With a serrated knife halve cake horizontally and spread bottom layer with lemon curd. Beat cream with confectioners' sugar until it just holds stiff peaks and spread on top of lemon curd. Top cream with remaining cake layer and sprinkle top of cake with remaining tablespoon granulated sugar.

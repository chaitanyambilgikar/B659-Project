In a saucepan combine the potatoes, unpeeled, with enough cold water to cover them by 1 inch, bring the water to a boil, and simmer the potatoes for 15 to 20 minutes, or until they are just tender. In a small bowl whisk together the oil, the vinegar, the garlic, the cumin, the paprika, and the red pepper flakes until the dressing is combined well. Drain the potatoes, pat them dry, and in a bowl toss them with the dressing, the scallions, the parsley, and salt and pepper to taste.

Make fish: Preheat oven to 500°F with rack in middle.
Brush a baking pan with 2 tablespoons oil.
Combine bread crumbs, cornmeal, and 1 teaspoon salt in a large sealable plastic bag and shake to mix.
Season fish with salt and pepper on both sides. Working with 1 piece at a time, dip fish in eggs, letting excess drip off, then put in bag and shake to coat well with crumbs.
Transfer fish to baking pan and bake until undersides are golden, about 6 minutes. Drizzle fish with remaining 2 tablespoons oil, then carefully turn over and cook until golden and just cooked thourough, about 6 minutes more.
Make rémoulade while fish bakes: Whisk together all rémoulade ingredients and salt to taste. Serve fish with sauce on the side.

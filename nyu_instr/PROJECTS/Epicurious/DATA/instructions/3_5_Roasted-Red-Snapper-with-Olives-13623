Preheat oven to 425°F.
Make sauce: In a small skillet boil wine with garlic until reduced to about 2 tablespoons. Add remaining sauce ingredients and salt and pepper to taste and bring to a simmer. Sauce may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered. Reheat sauce to warm before proceeding.
Pat snapper fillets dry and season with salt and pepper. Divide oil between 2 shallow baking pans large enough to hold fillets in one layer without touching and spread oil evenly. Heat baking pans in upper and lower thirds of oven 7 minutes. Working quickly, put fillets, skin sides down, in hot baking pans and roast in upper and lower thirds of oven 7 to 10 minutes, or until fish is just cooked through.
Transfer fillets with a metal spatula to a large platter, turning them skin sides up, and top with sauce.

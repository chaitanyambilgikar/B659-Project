Place sun-dried tomatoes in small bowl. Pour boiling water over to cover. Let stand until tomatoes are very soft, about 30 minutes. Drain, reserving 4 tablespoons soaking liquid.
Transfer tomatoes to processor. Add olives, onion, chopped basil, parsley and garlic and chop finely. Add vinegar, oil and 2 tablespoons reserved tomato soaking liquid; blend until moist paste forms, adding more soaking liquid if mixture is too thick. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover; chill.)
Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat) or preheat broiler. Sprinkle sea bass with salt and pepper. Grill or broil fish until opaque in center, about 4 minutes per side.
Transfer fish to plates. Top with spoonful of tapenade and serve.

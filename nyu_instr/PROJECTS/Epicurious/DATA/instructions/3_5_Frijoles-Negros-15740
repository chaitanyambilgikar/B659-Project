Rinse beans and pick over. In a 4-quart heavy saucepan soak beans in water to cover by 2 inches for 1 day.
Bring soaked beans to a boil in water, adding more water if necessary to cover by 1 1/2 inches. Skim any foam from surface of water and gently simmer beans, partially covered, over low heat 1 hour, or until beans are just tender but not falling apart.
In a large heavy skillet cook bacon over moderate heat, turning slices, until golden and crisp. Transfer bacon to paper towels to drain. Add 1 tablespoon bacon fat to beans, reserving bacon and any remaining rendered fat for another use.
Finely chop onion and bell pepper and stir into beans with remaining ingredients. Gently simmer beans, partially covered, 2 to 3 hours more, or until beans are tender and liquid is thickened. Discard bay leaves. Cool beans, uncovered, and chill, covered, at least 1 day and up to 5.

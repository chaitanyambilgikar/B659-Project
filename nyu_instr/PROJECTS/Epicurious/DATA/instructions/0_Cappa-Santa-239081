Preheat broiler. Put 6 scallop baking shells on a baking sheet. Put 1 large sea scallop in each shell. Top each with 1/2 teaspoon chopped shallots, 1/2 teaspoon butter, and 1 teaspoon dry white wine. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Put them under the broiler for 3 minutes. This recipe should take you about 5 minutes to do — it takes me 1 minute. Got it? Sprinkle with chopped Italian parsley. Add a squeeze of lemon and they're ready to serve. Don't burn your fingers!

Cook bacon in a 5-quart heavy pot over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until crisp, about 5 minutes. Transfer bacon with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon fat from pot and stir in potatoes, shallots, and clam juice. Simmer, covered, until potatoes are tender and most of liquid is evaporated, about 8 minutes. Stir in milk and cayenne and return just to a simmer.
Add shrimp, scallops, and salt and simmer, stirring occasionally, until shellfish is just cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in lobster and half of herbs and simmer 1 minute. Serve chowder topped with bacon and remaining herbs.

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Brush grill rack with oil. Place tomatoes, cut side up, on rack. Cook until bottoms are charred, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn tomatoes over and grill just to sear, about 1 minute. Turn cut side up onto platter. Sprinkle with 1/2 tablespoon each oregano and thyme, then drizzle with more oil, if desired. Serve warm.

Preheat oven to 375°F with racks in upper and lower thirds.
Arrange bacon slices in 1 layer (not overlapping) on racks of 2 large broiler pans (if you only have one, use a large rectangular metal rack set inside a large baking pan for the second). Bake until fat is rendered but bacon isn’t crisp, about 20 minutes. Drain on paper towels.
Arrange all of bacon in 1 layer on rack of 1 broiler pan. Brush top with syrup and sprinkle with pepper. Bake until bacon is crisp and deep golden, 20 to 25 minutes. Drain, glazed side up, on paper towels.

Cook lard and butter together over medium heat for 5 minutes. Add onion, bay leaf and thyme, cook till onion browns. With slotted spoon, remove onion and bay leaf. Reduce heat, sprinkle in flour, cook for 2 minutes, stirring well. Add wine. Raise heat and stirring with a sauce whisk, slowly add boiling stock. Add meat glaze. Now, depending how hurried you are, either add the peeled and seeded tomatoes and boil hard till tomatoes are liquified and entire sauce is reduced to 1 1/4 cups, or, more quickly, boil sauce hard until reduced to 1 1/4 cups and then dissolve tomato paste in a small quantity of hot sauce and add to rest of sauce. (Using tomato paste, the entire sauce takes about 1/2 hour.) Add salt and fresh pepper to taste. Allow 2 or 3 tablespoons of sauce per serving.

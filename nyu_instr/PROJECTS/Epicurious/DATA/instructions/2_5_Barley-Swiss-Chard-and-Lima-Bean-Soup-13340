In a baking pan toast the barley in a preheated 375°F. oven, shaking the pan occasionally, for 5 to 7 minutes, or until it is aromatic. In a large kettle cook the onions, the carrot, and the garlic in the oil over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are browned. Add the water, the broth, the ham hocks, and the parsley and simmer the mixture, uncovered, for 1 hour. Add the toasted barley and the celery and simmer the mixture, uncovered, for 45 minutes. Transfer the ham hocks with tongs to a cutting board, discard the fat and bones, and chop the ham coarse. To the kettle add the ham, the Swiss chard, the lima beans, the basil, the thyme, and salt and pepper to taste and simmer the soup for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the chard is tender.

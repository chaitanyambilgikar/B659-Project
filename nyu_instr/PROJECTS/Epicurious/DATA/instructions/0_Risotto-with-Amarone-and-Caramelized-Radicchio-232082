Melt 1 tablespoon butter with olive oil in heavy large deep skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and radicchio; sauté until beginning to brown, about 18 minutes. Add rice. Sprinkle with salt and pepper; stir until rice is translucent at edges but still opaque in center, about 3 minutes. Add wine; simmer until wine is absorbed, stirring occasionally, about 3 minutes. Add 5 1/2 cups broth; increase heat and bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer until rice is tender and risotto is creamy, stirring occasionally and adding more broth as needed, about 18 minutes. Remove risotto from heat; stir in remaining 3 tablespoons butter and Parmesan cheese. Season risotto to taste with salt and pepper and serve.

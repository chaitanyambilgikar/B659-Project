Toss the minced shallots with the salt in a bowl and let the shallots "weep" for a few minutes. This helps them flavor the vinaigrette more quickly. Whisk in the mustard and sherry vinegar. Slowly drizzle in the walnut oil and the olive oil. It's not important to keep this vinaigrette emulsified. If the oil and vinegar separate, just stir vigorously to recombine them before using. Season with the pepper and more salt if needed. This vinaigrette will keep several weeks in the fridge.
*Once oil has been opened, store it in the fridge to slow down the oxidation that leads to rancidity — especially a problem for nut oils.

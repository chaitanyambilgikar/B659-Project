Preheat oven to 375°F. Line 2 large shallow baking sheets with foil. Place walnuts and almonds on one sheet and toast until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Let cool, then coarsely chop and set aside.
Reduce oven temperature to 300°F. Divide oats between baking sheets. In medium bowl, melt butter in microwave. Stir in honey and salt. Drizzle mixture onto oats and stir well with rubber spatula.
Spread oats in even layer and bake, stirring once and switching positions of pans halfway through, until golden, about 30 minutes (mixture will crisp as it cools). Transfer to large bowl, cool, add remaining ingredients, and toss well.
Store airtight at room temperature up to one month.

Run the fish through a meat grinder twice; it should be very fine and smooth. (You can use a food processor, although it can be more difficult to get a smooth consistency that way.)
In a large bowl, lightly beat the eggs. Add the cornstarch, salt, pepper, and fish and mix well. Gently fold the cream into the fish mixture, trying not to deflate cream.
With a spoon, form the dumpling mixture into small balls.

Combine oil, lemon juice, rosemary and generous amount of pepper in large glass baking dish. Add steaks and turn to coat. Cover and chill 4 to 6 hours.
Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Remove steaks from marinade. Sprinkle steaks with salt. Grill to desired doneness, about 4 minutes per side for rare. Transfer to plates and serve.

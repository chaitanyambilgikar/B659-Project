Heat oil in large skillet over medium heat. Add walnuts and sauté until slightly darkened, about 5 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer nuts to small bowl; set aside. Add sun-dried tomatoes, garlic, and crushed red pepper to same skillet. Sauté until garlic is golden, about 3 minutes. Add spinach in 3 batches and cook until wilted, about 10 minutes total.
Meanwhile, cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally. Drain, reserving 3 tablespoons cooking liquid. Transfer reserved cooking liquid to large bowl; whisk in ricotta. Add walnuts, spinach mixture, and pasta; toss to combine. Season with salt and pepper. Serve, passing Parmesan cheese separately.

Preheat oven to 350°F. Divide bread cubes between 2 large rimmed baking sheets. Bake until bread is dry but not hard, stirring once, about 20 minutes. Butter 15x10x2-inch baking dish. Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add sausage; cook until browned, breaking up lumps, about 5 minutes. Add butter to pot; stir until melted. Add onions and next 7 ingredients. Cook until vegetables are tender and sausage is cooked, stirring often, about 7 minutes. Add bread; toss.
Whisk 1 cup broth and eggs in medium bowl to blend. Drizzle over bread mixture; toss to blend well. Add more broth if mixture is dry. Transfer stuffing to baking dish. Cover stuffing with buttered sheet of foil. Bake 40 minutes. Uncover and bake until browned and crisp on top, about 20 minutes longer.

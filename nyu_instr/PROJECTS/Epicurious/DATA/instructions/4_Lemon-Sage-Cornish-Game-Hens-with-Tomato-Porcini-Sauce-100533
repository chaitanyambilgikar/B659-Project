Combine 3/4 cup hot water and porcini mushrooms in small bowl. Let stand until mushrooms soften, about 30 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer mushrooms to work surface. Coarsely chop mushrooms. Set mushrooms and soaking liquid aside.
Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy medium skillet over medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon chopped sage and garlic. Sauté until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add puréed tomatoes, broth, chopped mushrooms and soaking liquid, leaving any sediment from liquid behind. Simmer over medium-low heat until thickened to sauce consistency, about 25 minutes. (Sauce can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
Preheat oven to 450°F. Pat hens dry with paper towels. Sprinkle cavities with salt and pepper. Place 1 sage sprig and 1 lemon wedge in cavity of each hen. Tie legs together to hold shape. Tuck wing tips under hen. Place hens on rack in large roasting pan. Rub remaining 2 tablespoons oil over hens. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon chopped sage over breast of each hen. Roast until hens are cooked through and juices run clear when thickest part of thigh is pierced, about 50 minutes. Transfer hens to platter. Tent with foil.
Pour pan juices from roasting pan into 1-cup glass measuring cup, scraping up any browned bits from bottom of pan. Spoon fat off top of juices. Add pan juices to tomato sauce. Simmer 2 minutes to blend flavors. Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.
Spoon Soft Polenta with Leeks onto 4 plates. Spoon tomato sauce over polenta. Place hens atop polenta and serve.

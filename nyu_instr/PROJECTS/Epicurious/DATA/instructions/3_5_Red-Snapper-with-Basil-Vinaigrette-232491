Preheat broiler and oil a large shallow baking pan (1 inch deep).
Season fish all over with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper, then put, skin sides down, in baking pan. Drizzle fillets with 1/2 tablespoon lemon juice and 1 tablespoon oil (total).
Broil fish 6 inches from heat until just cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer to a platter.
While fish broils, whisk together remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and 2 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice in a small bowl, then add remaining 5 tablespoons oil in a slow stream, whisking until emulsified. Stir in basil and spoon vinaigrette over cooked fish.

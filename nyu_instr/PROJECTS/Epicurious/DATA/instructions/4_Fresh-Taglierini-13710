Attach ribbon-pasta cutters to pasta machine and attach handle to thinnest cutter. Line a tray with a dry kitchen towel. Feed first rolled out pasta sheet, which will have dried out slightly but will still be soft, through cutter and toss generously with flour. Form pasta loosely into nest and arrange on kitchen-towel-lined tray. Make more taglierini with remaining dough in same manner. Taglierini may be made 1 day ahead and chilled on towel-lined tray, covered loosely with plastic wrap.

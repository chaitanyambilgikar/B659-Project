In a large bowl whisk together the vinegar, the oil, and salt and pepper to taste and stir in the corn, the tomatoes, and the scallion. In a kettle of boiling salted water cook the fusilli for 8 to 10 minutes, or until it is al dente, and drain it well. Transfer the fusilli to the bowl and toss the mixture well.

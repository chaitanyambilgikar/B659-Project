For biscuits Preheat oven to 450°F. Line cookie sheet with parchment. Mix first 5 ingredients in processor. Add butter and cut in until coarse meal forms. Add pecans and chop. Transfer mixture to large bowl. Combine 3/4 cup buttermilk and vanilla in large cup. Mix into dry ingredients, tossing gently with fork and adding enough buttermilk to form fluffy, moist dough.
Drop dough by slightly rounded 1/3 cupfuls onto prepared sheet, spacing 3 inches apart. Sprinkle top of each biscuit with sugar. Bake until golden and just firm to touch, about 15 minutes. Transfer biscuits to rack. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Let cool. Wrap in foil and store at room temperature. Rewarm biscuits in foil in 350°F. oven.)
For filling Combine sugar and berries in large bowl. Mix gently. Let stand at least 15 minutes. (Can be prepared 3 hours ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
Split warm biscuits. Place bottoms in shallow bowls. Spoon some fruit over each. Top each with 1/3 cup ice cream and biscuit tops. Spoon remaining fruit over tops. Serve immediately.

Preheat the oven to 350°F. Butter a baking sheet.
In a bowl, cream the butter and sugars with an electric mixer until the mixture is light. Add the vanilla extract and egg. Beat well. Add the flour, baking powder, and peanuts. Blend well.
Drop rounded tablespoons of batter, 2 inches apart, onto the baking sheet. Bake for about 10 minutes, or until the cookies are light brown. Cool. Drizzle the melted chocolate over the cooled cookies. Store in a cool, dry place.

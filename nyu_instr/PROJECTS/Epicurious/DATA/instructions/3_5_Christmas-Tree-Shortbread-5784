Preheat oven to 325°F. Using electric mixer, beat butter in large bowl until light. Gradually beat in powdered sugar. Beat in extracts. Add flour and salt and stir just until combined. Gather dough into ball; divide in half. Flatten each half into disk. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour.
Line 3 heavy large baking sheets with parchment paper. Roll out 1 dough disk on lightly floured surface to 1/8-inch thickness, frequently lifting and turning dough to prevent sticking. Cut out cookies, using 3-inch-long Christmas-tree cookie cutter. Gather scraps, reroll and cut out total of 36 cookies, placing 12 cookies on each prepared sheet. Spread 1 teaspoon jam in center of each cookie.
Roll out remaining dough disk and cut out more cookies. Cut out centers of each cookie, using 1-inch triangle cookie cutter. Using metal spatula, lift cookie frames onto jam-topped cookies. Gather scraps, reroll and cut additional cookie frames, making total of 36. Place on jam-topped cookies. Bake cookies until slightly golden brown around edges, about 25 minutes. Transfer to racks and cool.
Place half of Almond Icing in resealable plastic bag. Mix enough food coloring into remaining icing to make desired green color. Transfer green icing to another resealable plastic bag. Cut very tip off 1 corner of each bag. Pipe white icing along edges of trees. Pipe green icing in dots on trees. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.)

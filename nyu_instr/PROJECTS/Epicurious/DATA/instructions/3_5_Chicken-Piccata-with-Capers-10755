Halve the chicken pieces horizontally with a sharp knife and flatten them slightly between sheets of plastic wrap. In a large heavy skillet heat 1 tablespoon of the butter and the oil over moderately high heat until the foam subsides and in the fat sauté the chicken pieces, seasoned with salt and pepper, for 1 minute on each side, or until they are cooked through. Transfer the chicken with tongs to a platter and keep it warm, covered loosely. Pour off the fat in the skillet, to the skillet add the remaining 1 tablespoon butter, the wine, and the lemon juice, and bring the mixture to a boil. Stir in the capers, the parsley, and salt and pepper to taste and spoon the sauce over the chicken.

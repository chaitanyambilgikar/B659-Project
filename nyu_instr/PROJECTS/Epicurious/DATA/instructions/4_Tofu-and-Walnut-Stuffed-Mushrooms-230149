Preheat oven to 350°F. In a large skillet, sauté onion and garlic in 2 tbsp oil, with a pinch of salt, until tender. Crumble tofu over onion and sauté another 5 minutes. Add rosemary and tomatoes and cook on low heat about 10 minutes or until mixture is fairly dry. Add walnuts, miso, vinegar, tomato paste, and salt and pepper to taste. Drizzle remaining 2 tbsp oil over mixture. Place mushrooms in a baking dish and fill each with about 1 tbsp stuffing, using a spoon and pressing firmly to pack. Bake 20 minutes. Remove and top each hors d'oeuvre with a sprinkle of green onion. Serve warm.

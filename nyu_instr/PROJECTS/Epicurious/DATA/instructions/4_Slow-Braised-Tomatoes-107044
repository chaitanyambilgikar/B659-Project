Preheat oven to 250°F.
Cook onion and garlic in 2 tablespoons oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in basil and red pepper flakes.
Toss tomatoes with sugar and salt in a bowl. Arrange tomatoes, cut sides down, in a roasting or baking pan (13- by 9-inch). Spoon onion mixture over tomatoes and add enough of remaining 3/4 cup olive oil to reach halfway up tomatoes. Braise in middle of oven, stirring gently halfway through cooking, until tomatoes are very tender but not falling apart, 2 1/2 to 3 hours.

Make cake: Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350°F. Spray 10-inch-diameter cake pan with 2-inch-high sides with nonstick spray. Line bottom of pan with parchment paper; spray paper. Sift flour and next 6 ingredients into medium bowl. Mix in crystallized ginger.
Using electric mixer, beat butter in large bowl until fluffy. Beat in brown sugar. Beat in eggs 1 at a time. Gradually beat in molasses, then 1 cup boiling water. Mix in grated orange peel. Gradually mix in dry ingredients.
Transfer batter to prepared pan. Bake until tester inserted into center of cake comes out clean, about 1 hour. Transfer pan to rack and cool 15 minutes. Run knife around pan sides. Turn cake out onto rack; peel off paper. Cool.
Make filling and frosting: Beat cream and maple syrup in large bowl until stiff peaks form.
Cut cake horizontally into 3 equal layers. Transfer 1 cake layer, cut side up, to platter. Spread 1 1/2 cups whipped cream mixture over. Repeat layering with 1 cake layer and 1 1/2 cups whipped cream mixture. Top with remaining cake layer, cut side down. Spread remaining whipped cream over top and sides of cake.

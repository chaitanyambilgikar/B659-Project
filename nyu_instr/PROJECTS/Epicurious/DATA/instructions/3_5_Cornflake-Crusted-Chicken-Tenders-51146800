1. Preheat oven to 400°F. Cover a baking sheet with aluminum foil and set a heatproof wire baking rack on top; spray rack lightly with cooking spray.
2. In a small bowl or shallow dish, season flour with 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper; whisk eggs in another shallow dish. In a third shallow dish, mix cornflakes with parsley, garlic, dill, the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, and the remaining 1/4 teaspoon of pepper.
3. Dredge chicken in flour to coat, shaking off excess. Dip into egg and then into cornflake mixture, making sure entire surface is coated. Arrange on prepared baking rack.
4. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until golden brown and cooked through, flipping once during cooking. Serve with Buttermilk Ranch Sauce for dipping.

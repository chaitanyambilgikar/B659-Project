In bowl, whisk confectioner's sugar and cornstarch together. With a sieve, generously dust a jelly roll pan.
In a small heat-proof bowl, stir the gelatin into 1/2 cup water and let it soften 1 minute. Melt it over a low heat.
In a fairly deep pot, combine 3 2/3 cups sugar and the corn syrup with 1 cup water. Bring the mixture to a boil. Heat the syrup to 266°F.
In a 6-quart bowl, whip egg whites until frothy and add cream of tartar. Continue beating until soft peaks form. Gradually add remaining 1/3 cup sugar, beating until stiff peaks form. When the syrup reaches 266°F, add the gelatin to the syrup. Slowly pour hot syrup over the egg whites in a slow, steady stream. Add flavoring or coloring ifq you are using it.
With a spatula, spread mixture on prepared sheet pan and smooth top. Dust surface with some of remaining confectioner's sugar mixture. Let the meringue cool completely, for a few hours.
Using a chef's knife dipped in warm water (and wiped clean with a damp cloth between slices) cut marshmallows lengthwise into 1-inch strips. Cut across to make cubes. Work one section at a time and toss the cubes immediately in confectioner's sugar mixture. Shake marshmallow cubes in flat sieve to remove excess powder. To store, wrap finished marshmallows in plastic to avoid forming a crust skin.

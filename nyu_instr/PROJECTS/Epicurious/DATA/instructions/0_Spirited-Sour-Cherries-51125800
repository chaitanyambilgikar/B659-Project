Pack a clean, sterile quart-sized jar with a sterile lid with the cherries. Add the sugar and fill the jar with the eau-de-vie, leaving about 1/2 inch of headspace. Screw the lid on firmly and shake it well to dissolve the sugar. Store the jar in a cool, dark place for at least 4 weeks before use, shaking it occasionally. The flavor will continue to strengthen over several more months. Once you open the jar, store any remainders in the refrigerator.

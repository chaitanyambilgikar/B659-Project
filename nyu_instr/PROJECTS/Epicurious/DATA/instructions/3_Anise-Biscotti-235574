Preheat oven to 375°F. Line large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Mix first 8 ingredients in large bowl. Whisk eggs and all remaining ingredients in medium bowl to blend. Add egg mixture to flour mixture and stir until moistened; gather dough together. Turn dough out onto baking sheet and shape into 12-inch-long by 3-inch-wide log.
Bake log until golden brown and firm to touch, about 30 minutes. Transfer to rack and cool log on baking sheet 30 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 250°F. Using long metal spatula, carefully transfer log to work surface. Using serrated knife, cut crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Place slices, cut side down, on 2 clean rimmed baking sheets.
Bake 15 minutes. Turn slices over and bake 15 minutes longer or until just golden brown. Transfer biscotti to rack and cool completely.

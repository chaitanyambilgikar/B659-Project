Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium heat. Add onion, carrot, celery, 2 tablespoons parsley, garlic, rosemary, thyme, and bay leaf. Sauté until vegetables begin to brown, about 8 minutes. Add tomato paste; stir 1 minute. Add squash; stir 1 minute. Add chopped tomatoes and all beans; stir 1 minute. Add wine and simmer 2 minutes. Mix in broth, cream, and reserved tomato juice. Simmer until sauce thickens, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes. Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cool slightly, then cover and chill. Rewarm before using.)
Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally. Drain. Return pasta to same pot. Add sauce; toss over medium heat until coated.

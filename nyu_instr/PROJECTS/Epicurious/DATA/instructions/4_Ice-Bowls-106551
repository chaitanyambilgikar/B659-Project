Arrange 6 larger plastic bowls (1 1/2-pint) in a large baking pan and fill each with 1/3 cup springwater. Freeze until solid, about 2 hours.
Put smaller bowls (1-pint) inside larger bowls, centering them. Tape the 2 bowls together at the top in 3 places to keep the smaller bowl from moving. Arrange 5 to 7 pea sprouts in the space between the bowls, positioning them with a chopstick or skewer, then carefully pour in 1/3 cup springwater, making sure that sprouts are submerged. Freeze until solid, about 2 hours.
Repeat layering of sprouts (you will need about 3 ounces) and water and freezing until the ice level is 1/4 inch from the top of each bottom bowl. Remove the tape, pour warm water into top bowls and let stand about 1 minute before removing top bowls. Dip bottom bowls in a bowl of warm water about 1 minute and turn out ice bowls. Put ice bowls on 2 1/2-inch squares of paper towel centered on 6 small plates. Freeze bowls on plates about 1 hour.

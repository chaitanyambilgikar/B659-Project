Cook oil, lemongrass, and ginger in small saucepan over low heat 15 minutes to develop flavor. Cool completely. Strain oil into small bowl.
Whisk 1/4 cup ginger oil, lime juice, and lime peel in medium bowl to blend. Season vinaigrette with salt and pepper.
Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Brush remaining ginger oil over fish. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill until fish is just cooked through, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer fish to plates, drizzle with vinaigrette, and serve.

Preheat broiler.
On large rimmed baking sheet, broil peppers 2 inches from heat, turning occasionally with tongs, until blistered and blackened on all sides, 5 to 8 minutes. (Alternatively, char by holding with tongs over gas flame, turning until blistered on all sides.) Transfer to medium bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and let steam 10 minutes.
Peel, core, and seed peppers, then cut into 1/4-inch dice. In large bowl, combine peppers and remaining ingredients and toss well. (Salsa can be made up to 1 day ahead and refrigerated until ready to serve.)

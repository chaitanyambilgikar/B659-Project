Sauté bacon in heavy large pot over medium-high heat until crisp and brown. Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towels to drain. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons drippings from pot. Add potato, onion, celery, and bay leaves to pot. Sauté over medium-high heat until vegetables begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Add milk, frozen corn kernels, creamed corn, and vegetable broth and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer chowder until potato is tender, about 15 minutes. Add celery leaves, 1/4 teaspoon hot pepper sauce, and bacon. Simmer chowder uncovered until flavors blend, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and more hot pepper sauce, if desired.

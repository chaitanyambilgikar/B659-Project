Whisk 1/3 cup oil, hot sauce, and sugar in small bowl to blend. Season dressing to taste with salt and pepper.
Brush baking sheet with olive oil. Mix cornflakes and oregano in medium bowl. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Brush cheese wedges on all sides with 3 tablespoons oil. Dip cheese wedges in cornflake mixture, coating completely. Place on prepared baking sheet. (Dressing and cheese wedges can be made 4 hours ahead. Let dressing stand at room temperature; cover and chill cheese.)
Preheat oven to 400°F. Bake cheese wedges until hot and softened but not melted, about 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, toss lettuce with dressing in large bowl. Divide among 6 plates. Top each salad with 2 hot cheese wedges.

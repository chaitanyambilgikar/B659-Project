Melt butter in heavy large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and sauté until translucent, about 10 minutes. Add vermouth and simmer until all liquid evaporates, about 4 minutes. Add artichokes, broth, and thyme. Simmer until artichoke hearts begin to fall apart, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat. Cool slightly. Working in batches, puree soup in blender until smooth. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
Pour soup into saucepan. Stir in cream and blue cheese. Simmer over medium heat until cheese melts and soup is smooth, whisking constantly, about 2 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Ladle into bowls. Sprinkle with chives and serve.

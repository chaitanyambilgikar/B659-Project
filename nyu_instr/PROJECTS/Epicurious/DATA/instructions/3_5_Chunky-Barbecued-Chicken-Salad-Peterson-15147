In a large bowl whisk together barbecue sauce and mayonnaise. Wearing rubber gloves, finely chop chipotle and whisk into dressing.
Discard bones from chicken and cut meat into 1/2-inch pieces. Finely chop enough onion to measure 1/3 cup. Finely chop bell pepper and cilantro separately and add to dressing with chicken and onion, stirring to combine well. Season salad with salt and pepper.

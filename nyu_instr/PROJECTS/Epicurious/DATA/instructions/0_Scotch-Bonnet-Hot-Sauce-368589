Combine the chiles, pepper, zest, garlic, 2 tablespoons of the cordial, and 2 teaspoons of the salt in a blender. Pulse until coarsely ground. Transfer to an airtight container and let stand in a warm place for at least 12 hours and up to 1 day to ferment.
Pour the mixture into the blender and add the vinegar, remaining 1/2 tablespoon cordial, and remaining 2 teaspoons salt. Blend until very smooth. Strain through a medium-mesh sieve, pressing on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard the solids.
Stir in the guar gum until dissolved. (If using the cornstarch, bring the sauce to a boil and stir in the cornstarch mixture. Cook until thickened, about 1 minute, then let cool to room temperature.) The sauce can be covered and refrigerated for up to 1 week.

Very finely chop together olives, capers, and pine nuts with a large heavy knife. Transfer to a large serving bowl along with parsley and red-pepper flakes, then stir in oil until combined.
Meanwhile, cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, uncovered, until al dente. Reserve 1 cup pasta-cooking water, then drain in a colander.
Add spaghetti to olive mixture in bowl and toss until combined well. (If pasta is dry, moisten with some reserved cooking water.)

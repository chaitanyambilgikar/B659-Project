Using a mandoline or other hand-held slicer, cut carrot and zucchini lengthwise into 1/8-inch ribbons. Lay ribbons flat and cut lengthwise into 1/8-inch julienne. In a non-stick skillet heat butter over moderately high heat until foam subsides and sauté carrot, zucchini, and zests, stirring, until vegetables are tender, about 3 minutes. Stir in almonds and season with salt and pepper.

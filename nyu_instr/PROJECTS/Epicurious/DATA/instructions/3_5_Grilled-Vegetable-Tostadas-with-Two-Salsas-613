To make the tomatillo salsa: Heat oil in large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onion and garlic; sauté 5 minutes. Add tomatillos; sauté 3 minutes. Add broth. Reduce heat, cover and simmer until tomatillos are soft, about 8 minutes.
Blend tomatillo mixture and cilantro in food processor until almost smooth. Transfer to bowl. Mix in chili powder. Season with hot pepper sauce and salt. Cover; chill up to 2 days.
To make the tomato-chili salsa: Place chilies in bowl. Cover with hot water. Soak until soft, about 20 minutes. Drain. Cut open; scrape out seeds. Cut off stems and coarsely chop chilies.
Blanch tomatoes in boiling water for 20 seconds. Drain and peel. Cut in half; squeeze out seeds. Chop tomatoes.
Combine chilies and 3/4 cup tomatoes in processor; puree until smooth. Transfer to bowl. Mix in remaining tomatoes, green onions, cilantro, garlic, sugar and cumin. Season with salt. Cover; chill up to 1 day.
To make the tortillas: Line baking sheet with paper towels. Heat oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1 tortilla; fry until crisp and golden, about 30 seconds per side. Transfer tortilla to paper towels and drain. Repeat frying and draining with remaining tortillas.
To make the grilled vegetables: Preheat oven to 350°F. Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Mix olive oil, garlic, chili powder and salt in large bowl. Pour 1/4 cup oil mixture into small bowl and reserve. Add zucchini, bell peppers and eggplant to oil mixture in large bowl; toss to coat.

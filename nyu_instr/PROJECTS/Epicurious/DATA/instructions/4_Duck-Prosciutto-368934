Using a small knife, trim all but a 1/8" layer of fat from each duck breast; reserve fat for rendering. Mix remaining ingredients in a medium bowl.
Arrange 2 sheets of plastic wrap side by side on a work surface. Spread 1 scant cup salt mixture (do not pack) in center of each sheet, spreading mixture to match the size of the duck breasts. Top each with 1 duck breast, fat side down. Spread remaining salt mixture over meat, dividing equally. Bring plastic wrap up and over each duck breast, wrapping tightly. Place on a small rimmed baking sheet, fat side down, and refrigerate for 7 days to cure.
Unwrap duck breasts. Scrape off salt mixture (do not rinse). Using a long, sharp knife, thinly slice meat.

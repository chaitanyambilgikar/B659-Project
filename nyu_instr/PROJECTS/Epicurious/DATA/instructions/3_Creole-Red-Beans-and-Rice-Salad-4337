Combine 1 cup water, rice, 1 tablespoon thyme and cayenne in heavy medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring just to boil. Cover pan, reduce heat to low and cook until rice is tender and water is absorbed, about 20 minutes.
Transfer rice to large bowl. Add beans, bell pepper, tomatoes, dressing and remaining 2 tablespoons thyme; toss to combine. Season salad to taste with salt and pepper. Serve warm or at room temperature.

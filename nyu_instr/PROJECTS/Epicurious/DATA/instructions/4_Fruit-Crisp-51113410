1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Place six ramekins on a baking sheet and set aside.
2. In a large bowl, gently toss together the fruit, sugar, and lemon zest and let rest for 5 minutes.
3. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, oats, salt, brown sugar, walnuts, and butter. Using your hands or a spoon, gently toss to blend the ingredients and then rub the mixture together to work the butter into walnut-size lumps.
4. Divide the fruit between the ramekins, gently packing it down. Divide the oat and walnut streusel topping between the ramekins, packing a hearty mound on top of each.
5. Bake the fruit crisps until the streusel is golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes. Let rest 10 minutes before serving.

In a small bowl with a fork stir together the confectioners' sugar and the cinnamon until the mixture is combined well. In a bowl with a fork blend the flour, the eggs, the granulated sugar, and a pinch of salt until the mixture forms a dough. On a lightly floured surface knead the dough until it is soft and elastic, roll it out slightly less than 1/4 inch thick, and cut into 2-inch squares. Make a 1-inch slit through the center of each square and pull one corner of the square through the slit.
In a heavy kettle heat 3 inches of the oil until it registers 375°F. on a deep-fat thermometer and in it fry the cookies in batches for 1 minute on each side, or until they are pale golden. Transfer the cookies as they are fried with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain and, while they are still warm, sprinkle them with the cinnamon sugar.

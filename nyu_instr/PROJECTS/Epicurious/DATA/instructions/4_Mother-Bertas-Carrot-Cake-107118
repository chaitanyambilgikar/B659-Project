1. Cut 2 carrots into 1-inch dice; place in a saucepan, cover with water and simmer until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain and puree in a food processor or blender. Set aside.
2. Grate the remaining carrot; reserve.
3. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan. Line the bottom with waxed paper and grease the paper.
4. Sift the flour, sugar, baking soda and cinnamon into a large bowl. Add the oil, eggs and vanilla; beat well. Fold in the carrot puree, grated carrot, walnuts, coconut and pineapple.
5. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 1 hour.
6. Cool the cake in the pan for 10 minutes before unmolding it onto a rack, then let the cake cool completely.
7. Prepare the frosting: Mix the cream cheese and butter together in a bowl. Slowly add the confectioners' sugar. Stir in the vanilla and lemon juice. Frost the cake.

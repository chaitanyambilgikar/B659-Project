Rinse rice in a sieve under cold running water until water runs clear.
Bring rice, water (3 1/2 cups), 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper to a boil in a 2 2 1/2- to 3-quarts heavy saucepan, uncovered, over medium-high heat. Cover and reduce heat to low, then cook until rice is tender and most of water has been absorbed, about 35 minutes.
Remove from heat and let stand, covered, 10 minutes. Fluff with a fork.

Combine first 6 ingredients in processor and blend to coarse puree. Blend in cheese using on/off turns. Season to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 1 week ahead. Transfer pesto to jar. Pour enough additional oil over pesto to cover completely. Cover and refrigerate. Pour off extra oil before using.)
Cook linguine in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite. Drain well. Return to same pot. Add pesto sauce and toss to coat pasta evenly. Transfer to large platter. Garnish with chopped pine nuts.

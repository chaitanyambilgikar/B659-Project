In a large skillet heat 2 tablespoons of the butter over moderately high heat until the foam subsides, in it brown the chops, patted dry and seasoned with salt and pepper, in batches for 2 minutes on each side, and transfer them to a plate. Pour off the fat from the skillet, add the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons butter, and in it sauté the apples, peeled, cored, and cut into eighths, with 1 tablespoon of the brown sugar over moderately high heat, turning them for 3 minutes, or until they are golden. Add the applejack, the wine, the remaining tablespoon brown sugar, the cream, the celery salt, and the sage, bring the mixture to a boil, and add the chops with any juices that have accumulated on the plate. Simmer the mixture, covered, for 20 minutes, or until the chops and the apples to a heated platter. Cook the sauce for 1 minute, or until it is thickened, and pour it over the chops and apples.

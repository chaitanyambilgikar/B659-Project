Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 400°F. Line large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Whisk whole wheat flour, bread flour, baking powder, salt, onion powder, baking soda, thyme, and sage in large bowl to blend. Add butter and rub in with fingertips until mixture resembles coarse meal. Whisk 1 cup buttermilk and egg in small bowl to blend. Add to flour mixture and mix with fork until evenly moistened (dough will be slightly sticky).
Turn biscuit dough out onto floured work surface. Knead briefly just until dough comes together, about 4 turns. Gather dough into ball. Using hands, flatten dough to 3/4-inch-thick round. Using 2-inch-diameter biscuit cutter or cookie cutter dipped in flour, cut out rounds. Transfer rounds to prepared baking sheet, spacing 1 to 1 1/2 inches apart. Gather dough scraps; flatten to 3/4-inch thickness and cut out additional rounds. Brush tops of biscuits with additional buttermilk.
Bake biscuits until tops are light golden and tester inserted into centers comes out clean, about 22 minutes. Transfer biscuits to rack. Serve warm or at room temperature.
A LITTLE AHEAD: Can be made 8 hours ahead. Cool biscuits completely, then wrap in foil and store at room temperature. Rewarm foil-wrapped biscuits in 350°F oven about 10 minutes, if desired, or serve at room temperature.
FURTHER AHEAD: Dry ingredients (the first 8) can be blended up to 2 days ahead. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature.
*White whole wheat flour is milled from 100 percent hard white wheat. It contains all of the germ and bran (and nutritional value) of regular whole wheat, but has a naturally lighter color and milder flavor. It's available at some supermarkets and specialty foods stores and from kingarthurflour.com.

Scald, peel and pit the nectarines. In place of the pits, substitute 1 date and 1 pecan half for each nectarine, pressing the nectarine halves together. Cook the lemon juice and 1/4 of the sugar in a large Dutch oven over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the sugar is melted. Remove from the heat, pack the nectarines in the syrup and pour the remaining sugar over them. Bake, covered, in a 250° oven for 1 hour. Uncover and bake for 2 hours longer, covering if the syrup evaporates too quickly. (There should be approximately 4 cups syrup, enough to cover the fruit when it is packed in the jars.) Carefully lower the fruit into hot, sterilized preserving jars, using 2 spoons to keep the nectarine halves together. Pour in the juices, cover and seal.

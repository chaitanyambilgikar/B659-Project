Fold white chocolate chunks into dark chocolate ice cream in large bowl. Cover and freeze until firm, about 4 hours.
Bring 3/4 cup water to boil in heavy medium saucepan. Whisk in cocoa. Add butter. Stir over low heat until mixture is smooth. Add both sugars, corn syrup and salt. Stir over low heat until sugars dissolve, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in vanilla. (Dark chocolate ice cream and sauce can be made 1 week ahead. Keep ice cream frozen. Cover sauce and refrigerate. Rewarm sauce over low heat.)
Drizzle some warm chocolate sauce into bottom of 6 parfait glasses or wineglasses. Place 1 scoop mint chip ice cream in each glass. Spoon some chocolate sauce over ice cream. Spoon dark chocolate ice cream, then mint chip ice cream into glasses, spooning some sauce over each layer. Sprinkle dried cherries over. Garnish parfaits with fresh mint.

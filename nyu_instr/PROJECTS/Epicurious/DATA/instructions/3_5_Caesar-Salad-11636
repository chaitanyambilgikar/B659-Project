Make croutons: Preheat oven to 350°F. In a bowl toss bread cubes with oil and salt to taste and spread in a jelly-roll pan. Bake croutons in middle of oven until golden, 10 to 15 minutes.
Make dressing: In a blender blend together at high speed garlic, anchovies, lemon juice, mayonnaise, and salt until smooth. With motor running add oil in a slow stream and blend until emulsified. Add water and blend dressing well.
In a large bowl toss romaine with dressing, Parmesan, croutons, and pepper to taste.

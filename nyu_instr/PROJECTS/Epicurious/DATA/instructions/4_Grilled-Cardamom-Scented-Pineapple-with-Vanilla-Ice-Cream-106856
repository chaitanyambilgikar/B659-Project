Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Bring molasses, butter, and cardamom to boil in heavy medium saucepan over high heat, stirring occasionally to melt butter. Reduce heat to low and simmer until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in lime juice. (Can be made 4 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature. Whisk before using.)
Brush pineapple rounds with peanut oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill until golden brown and slightly charred, brushing with glaze on each side during last 30 seconds of cooking, about 4 minutes per side. Divide pineapple among 6 plates. Top with vanilla ice cream, and drizzle with remaining glaze.

Place porcini in medium bowl. Pour 1 cup boiling water over. Let stand until porcini are soft, about 30 minutes. Remove porcini from water, reserving soaking liquid. Finely chop porcini.
Melt butter in heavy medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add porcini and sauté 3 minutes. Add cream and 3/4 cup soaking liquid, leaving any sediment behind in bowl. Simmer until liquid is reduced to 3/4 cup, stirring occasionally, about 4 minutes. Stir in marinara sauce; bring to simmer. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover; chill. Bring to simmer before using.)
Cook gnocchi in large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite. Drain.
Add gnocchi to sauce and toss to coat. Divide among 4 plates. Serve, passing Parmesan separately.

Cover onions with water in a 2- to 3-quart heavy saucepan, then bring to a simmer and cook 5 minutes. Drain and transfer to a clean heatproof jar. Simmer remaining ingredients in saucepan 5 minutes, then pour over onions. Cool completely, uncovered. Chill, covered, 1 week to allow flavors to develop.

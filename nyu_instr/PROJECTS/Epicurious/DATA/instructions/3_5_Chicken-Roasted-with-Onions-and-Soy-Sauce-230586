Place the chicken pieces in a roasting pan and toss with the rice wine or gin, soy sauce, sesame oil, salt, sugar, rice vinegar, and pepper. Put the garlic slices on and under the chicken pieces. Allow to rest for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375°F.
Heat a wok over high heat for 30 seconds, add the peanut oil, and coat the wok with it, using a spatula. When a wisp of white smoke appears, add the onions. Stir and cook for a minute, lower the heat to medium, and cook for another 3 minutes until onions are soft. Turn off the heat.
Spoon the onions over, around, and under the chicken pieces. Place the roasting pan with the chicken and onions in the preheated oven and roast for 30 minutes. Lower the heat to 350°F, turn the chicken over, and roast for another 30 minutes. Turn the chicken over again and cook for a final 30 minutes, basting halfway through. Turn off the heat. Transfer the chicken to a heated platter and serve with cooked rice.

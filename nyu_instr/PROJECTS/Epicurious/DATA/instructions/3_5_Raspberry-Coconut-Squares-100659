Preheat oven to 350° F. Lightly grease a 17-by 12-inch jelly-roll pan.
Make crust: In a food processor finely grind graham crackers (you will have about 2 cups crumbs). Cut margarine or butter into bits. In a large bowl stir together crumbs, flour, and sugar. Add margarine or butter with your fingertips blend until mixture resembles coarse meal. In a bowl lightly beat eggs. Add eggs to crumb mixture, tossing with a fork to blend, and press evenly onto bottom of pan.
Make Filling: Spread jam evenly over crust. In a lage bowl with an electric mixer beat butter briefly and add sugar, beating until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after addition. Add coconut and beat until combined.
Drop coconut mixture by small spoonfulls over jam and spread carefully, coating jam evenly.

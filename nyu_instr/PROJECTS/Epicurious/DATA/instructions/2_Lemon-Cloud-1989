Sprinkle gelatin over 2 tablespoons water in small saucepan and let stand 10 minutes to soften. Stir constantly over low heat until gelatin dissolves. Set aside. Combine sugar and lemon juice in another small saucepan. Stir over low heat until sugar dissolves. Clip candy thermometer onto side of saucepan. Increase heat and boil without stirring until thermometer registers 238°F, about 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, using electric mixer, beat egg whites and pinch of salt in large bowl until soft peaks form. Gradually beat hot syrup into egg whites. Add gelatin mixture and lemon peel and beat until mixture is stiff, glossy and cool, about 3 minutes. Mix in yogurt. Divide among 8 custard cups or ramekins. Refrigerate until set, about 2 hours. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Keep chilled.)

Melt 1 tablespoon butter in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat. Add shallots, peppercorns and thyme and sauté mixture until shallots are tender, about 5 minutes. Add 2 cups red wine. Increase heat and boil until liquid is reduced to 1 cup, about 20 minutes. Strain sauce and return to same saucepan. Add 1/2 cup whipping cream and boil until reduced to sauce consistency, about 7 minutes. Stir in horseradish. Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Bring to simmer before using.)
Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat) or preheat broiler. Season steaks generously with salt and pepper. Grill or broil to desired doneness, about 5 minutes per side for medium-rare.
Transfer steaks to plates. Spoon horseradish sauce around and serve.

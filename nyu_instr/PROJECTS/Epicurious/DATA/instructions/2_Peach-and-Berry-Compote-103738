Blanch and peel peaches. Cut into 1/4-inch-thick wedges.
Simmer peaches, wine, and sugar in a 3-quart saucepan, stirring occasionally, 2 minutes, then remove from heat. Immediately transfer mixture to a bowl and add berries, tossing to combine. Cool compote completely.
Serve compote chilled or at room temperature.

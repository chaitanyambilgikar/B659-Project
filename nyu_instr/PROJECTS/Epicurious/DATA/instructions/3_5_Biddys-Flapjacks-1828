Preheat oven to 350°F. Line 9-inch square baking pan with foil, leaving 2-inch overhang. Melt butter, sugar and syrup in heavy medium saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring until sugar dissolves. Mix in oats, nuts and sunflower seeds. Transfer mixture to prepared pan. Press down firmly to form even layer. Bake until golden brown, about 25 minutes. Transfer to rack and cool. Using foil sides as aid, lift cookie out of pan. Carefully cut into squares. (Can be prepared 2 days ahead. Store in airtight container at room temperature.)

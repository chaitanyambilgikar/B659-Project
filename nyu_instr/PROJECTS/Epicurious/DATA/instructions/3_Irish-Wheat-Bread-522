Preheat oven to 375°F. Grease two 8-inch-diameter cake pans. Stir first 5 ingredients in large bowl. Stir in currants. Whisk buttermilk, butter and egg in small bowl. Add to dry ingredients and stir just until combined. Knead mixture briefly in bowl until dough comes together. Turn out onto floured surface and knead until smooth, about 2 minutes.
Divide dough into 2 pieces. Shape each into round loaf. Transfer to prepared pans. Using sharp knife, cut an x on surface of each loaf, cutting about 1/2 inch deep. Bake until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 50 minutes. Turn out loaves onto racks; cool.(Can be made 1 day ahead. Wrap in plastic; store at room temperature.)

For spread: Blend cream cheese, grape leaves, and lemon juice in mini processor until grape leaves are minced and mixture is blended. Season spread to taste with salt and pepper. Can be made 1 day ahead. Transfer spread to small bowl. Cover and refrigerate. Bring spread to room temperature before using.
For fritters: Whisk first 5 ingredients in medium bowl to blend. Mix in zucchini, parsley, and chives. Let stand until batter becomes moist, about 15 minutes. Using wet hands, shape by rounded tablespoonfuls into twelve 2-inch-diameter patties; place on foil.
Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add about half of patties. Sauté until cooked through, browned, and crisp, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to platter. Repeat with remaining patties, adding more oil, if needed.
Spread heaping teaspoon grape-leaf spread on each fritter. Top each with 1 shrimp. Sprinkle fritters with lemon juice, then lemon peel, and serve.

For cake: Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter and flour two 9-inch round cake pans with 2-inch-high sides. Whisk first 5 ingredients in large bowl to blend. Whisk in oil, eggs, and vanilla. Stir in bananas, pecans, and pineapple. Divide batter equally between prepared pans. Bake cakes until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool cakes in pans on racks 10 minutes. Run knife around cake sides and turn out onto rack to cool completely.
For frosting: Using electric mixer, beat cream cheese and butter in large bowl to blend. Beat in sugar and vanilla. Place 1 cake layer on plate. Spread 1 1/2 cups frosting over. Top with second cake layer. Spread remaining frosting over top and sides of cake. Sprinkle toasted pecans in border around top edge of cake. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover; chill. Let stand at room temperature before serving.)

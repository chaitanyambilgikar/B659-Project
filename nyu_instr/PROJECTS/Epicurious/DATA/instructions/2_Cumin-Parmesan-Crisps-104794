Mix cheese and cumin in medium bowl. Spray medium nonstick skillet with nonstick spray; heat over medium heat. Sprinkle 3 tablespoons cheese mixture in 4-inch round lace-like pattern over bottom of skillet. Cook until cheese is melted, bubbling and golden brown, about 4 minutes. Remove skillet from heat. Using thin metal spatula, carefully and gradually loosen edges of cheese crisp; gently transfer to paper towels to cool. Repeat with remaining cheese mixture, cooking 1 cheese crisp at a time and spraying skillet with nonstick spray before each crisp is cooked. Cool. (Can be made 6 hours ahead. Store in airtight container at room temperature.) Serve at room temperature.

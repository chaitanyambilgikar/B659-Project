Make sofrito: Purée all sofrito ingredients in a food processor until smooth.
Marinate chicken and make stew: Toss chicken with sofrito in a bowl, then marinate, covered and chilled, at least 1 hour.
Remove chicken from sofrito, shaking off excess, and reserve sofrito. Heat oil in a 4- to 6-quart heavy pot over moderate heat until hot but not smoking, then brown chicken in batches without crowding, starting with skin sides down and turning over once, until golden, about 5 minutes per batch. Transfer to a plate.
Meanwhile, peel potatoes and cut into 1/2-inch pieces.
When all of chicken is browned, pour off all but 2 tablespoons fat from pot. Add reserved sofrito to pot and cook over moderate heat, scraping up brown bits, 2 minutes. Add water, beer, potatoes, and rice and simmer, covered, 5 minutes. Add chicken along with any juices accumulated on plate and simmer, covered, until chicken is cooked through and rice is tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, 5 minutes.
Stir in chopped cilantro. Add salt and hot sauce to taste.

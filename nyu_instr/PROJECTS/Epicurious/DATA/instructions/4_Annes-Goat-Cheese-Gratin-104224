1. Preheat the broiler.
2. Scatter the cheese on the bottom of the baking dish or dishes. Sprinkle with half of the herbs. Spoon on just enough tomato sauce to evenly coat the cheese. Sprinkle with olives and the remaining herbs.
3. Place the baking dish or dishes under the broiler about 3 inches (8 cm) from the heat. Broil until the cheese is melted and fragrant, and the tomato sauce is sizzling, 2 to 3 minutes.
Wine suggestion: Think of what you'd normally serve with pizza; a pleasant, vigorous red such as a young French Corbières from the Roussilon, a dry Italian red such as a Barbera d'Alba, an Australian Shiraz, or a California Zinfandel.

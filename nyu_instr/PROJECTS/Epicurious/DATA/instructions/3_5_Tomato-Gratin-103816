Preheat oven to 500°F.
Arrange tomato slices, slightly overlapping, in an oiled 9-inch gratin dish or shallow casserole. Season with salt and pepper and sprinkle with basil.
Cook garlic in oil in a small skillet over moderate heat, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Remove from heat and stir in bread crumbs, cheese, and salt and pepper to taste. Sprinkle over tomatoes.
Bake in middle of oven until crumbs are golden, about 15 minutes.

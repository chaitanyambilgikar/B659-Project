Toast nuts in a small shallow baking pan until fragrant and a few shades darker, about 10 minutes. While nuts toast, melt 1 tablespoon butter and stir together with syrup and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Add maple glaze to hot nuts and toss to coat.

Add vinegar and sauté, stirring, 1 minute. Add hickory nuts and any glaze in baking pan and sauté, stirring, 1 minute.

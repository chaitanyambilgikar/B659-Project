Make crust and filling: Preheat oven to 325°F. Butter 9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom. Mix cookie crumbs and cinnamon in medium bowl. Add melted butter and stir until crumbs are evenly moistened. Press crumb mixture firmly onto bottom and up sides of prepared pan. Bake until crust is set, about 9 minutes. Cool completely.
Sprinkle 2 tablespoons chopped toffee over cooled crust. Spread ice cream evenly in crust. Freeze until firm, at least 4 hours or overnight.
Make topping: Combine cream and butter in medium saucepan. Bring to simmer. Remove from heat. Add white chocolate; let stand 1 minute. Stir until chocolate is melted and smooth. Mix in vanilla. Let topping stand until cool and slightly thickened but still pourable, about 15 minutes.
Pour white chocolate topping over ice cream tart; tilt pan to cover top of tart completely. Freeze until topping is firm, about 1 hour. Sprinkle remaining toffee over. Freeze until tart is firm, about 4 hours. (Can be prepared 5 days ahead. Cover tightly and keep frozen.)
Using small knife, carefully loosen crust from pan sides. Gently push up tart bottom to release tart and serve.

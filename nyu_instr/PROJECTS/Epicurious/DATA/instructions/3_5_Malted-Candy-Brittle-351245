Line large baking sheet with parchment paper; spray parchment with nonstick spray. Combine malt powder, baking soda, and coarse salt in small bowl. Combine sugar, 1/4 cup water, and cream of tartar in heavy medium saucepan. Stir over low heat until sugar dissolves, occasionally brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush. Increase heat and boil until syrup is dark amber, swirling pan occasionally, about 8 minutes. Turn off heat. Add butter, then quickly add malt mixture; whisk to blend.
Pour mixture onto prepared sheet. Tilt sheet to spread mixture evenly. Cool completely. Break brittle into large chunks. Store brittle in airtight container at room temperature up to 1 week.

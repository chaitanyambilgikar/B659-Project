Make garlic oil: Preheat oven to 450°F. Wrap garlic head in foil and roast in middle of oven until tender, about 45 minutes. Carefully unwrap garlic and cool. Horizontally halve garlic head and arrange, cut sides down, in a small bowl with oil. Let mixture stand, covered and chilled, 2 to 3 days to infuse oil with garlic flavor.
Preheat broiler.
In a saucepan boil cream, stirring occasionally, until reduced to about 1/2 cup. Add Gorgonzola and cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until cheese melts and sauce is smooth. Remove pan from heat and keep sauce warm, covered.
Horizontally halve baguette and arrange, cut sides up, on a baking sheet. Broil bread 2 to 3 inches from heat until golden. (If crust is soft, you may broil crust side of baguette as well.) Brush cut sides of baguette with garlic oil and season with salt. Cut baguette crosswise into 1-inch-thick slices.
Pour warm Gorgonzola sauce onto center of a large plate and arrange roasted garlic bread slices around sauce.

Preheat oven to 350°F. Line baking sheet with parchment paper. Place prosciutto slices in single layer on parchment. Bake until crisp, about 18 minutes. Cool. Break prosciutto into bite-size pieces.
Meanwhile, cook asparagus in heavy large pot of boiling salted water until crisp-tender, about 4 minutes.
Drain. Transfer asparagus to bowl filled with ice water to cool. Drain thoroughly.
Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add chopped anchovies and garlic and sauté until garlic is golden, about 1 minute. Add asparagus and prosciutto and sauté until heated through, about 3 minutes. Add fresh lemon juice and remaining 1/2 cup olive oil and simmer 1 minute. Remove from heat. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Divide greens among 6 plates. Top with asparagus mixture, dividing equally. Pour dressing from skillet over each serving. Serve warm with Farinata Wedges.

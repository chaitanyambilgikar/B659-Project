Mince garlic and mash to a paste with a pinch of salt using a large heavy knife. Mash together butter, anchovy paste, lemon juice, garlic paste, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper until combined well. Stir in parsley.
Pat steaks dry and sprinkle with salt and remaining 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Heat oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking. Sauté steaks 1 at a time, turning once, about 8 minutes total for medium-rare. Transfer steaks to a cutting board and let stand 5 minutes before serving.
Top steaks with a dollop of anchovy butter and slice.

Preheat the oven to the lowest heat setting (150–200°F). The goal here is to dry the tomatoes slowly but surely.
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Arrange the tomatoes on top, cut side up. Sprinkle lightly with salt.
Bake the tomatoes until the edges have shriveled and the insides are still slightly moist but not juicy. Timing depends on the type and size of tomato; the drying will take anywhere between 2 and 8 hours.
Set the pan aside until completely cool and then transfer the tomatoes to a clean and sterilized jar. Add a few sprigs of dry herbs and a clove of garlic, if using, to the jar. Pour in olive oil, thoroughly covering the tomatoes to preserve them.
Store in the fridge for 4–6 weeks. Use up the remaining olive oil in dishes that can benefit from the savory tomato flavor.

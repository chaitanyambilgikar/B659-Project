Melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add onions and celery. Sauté until tender, about 12 minutes. Add apples and all herbs. Sauté until apples just begin to soften, about 3 minutes. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Transfer to medium bowl, cover, and chill.
Mix 1 cup broth and dried fruit in bowl. Let soak at least 1 hour and up to 3 hours.
Preheat oven to 350°F. Divide bread between 2 rimmed baking sheets. Bake until bread is crusty but not hard, reversing sheets after 5 minutes, 10 to 12 minutes total. Transfer to very large bowl and cool.
Butter 13x9x2-inch baking dish. Stir vegetable mixture into bread. Whisk eggs, salt, and pepper in small bowl to blend; whisk in broth and dried fruit mixture. Add egg mixture to stuffing, tossing to combine evenly and adding more broth by 1/4 cupfuls if dry. Transfer stuffing to prepared dish.
Bake stuffing uncovered until cooked through and brown and crusty on top, 50 to 60 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes.

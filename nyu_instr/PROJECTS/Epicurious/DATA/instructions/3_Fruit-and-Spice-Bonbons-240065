1. Mix the dried fruit and spices with your hands until well combined.
2. Scoop 1 tablespoon of the mixture and roll it into a ball about 1/2 inch in diameter. Repeat until the entire mixture has been used.
3. Roll the balls in the sugar, cocoa, or nuts (or skip this part, if serving plain), and place them in paper mini-muffin cups. Serve or store airtight at room temperature for up to a week.

Combine the walnuts, honey granules, salt, and cinnamon in a bowl and toss to coat the nuts evenly with the other ingredients. Spread the nuts on a nonstick drying sheet on a dehydrator shelf and dehydrate at 105°F for 12 hours. Transfer the nuts to the shelf, spreading them evenly, and continue to dehydrate for 24 hours longer, or until crisp. Use immediately, or store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week.

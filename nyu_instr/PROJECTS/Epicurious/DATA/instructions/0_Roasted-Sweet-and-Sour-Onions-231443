Preheat oven to 375°F. Wrap each onion tightly in foil. Place onions in roasting pan and roast until very tender when pierced with knife, about 1 1/2 hours. Cool. Trim and remove onion peel. Halve onions lengthwise, then slice thinly lengthwise. Transfer to medium bowl. Add vinegar and lemon juice and toss to blend. Let onion mixture stand at room temperature at least 1 hour and up to 3 hours.
Combine 1/2 cup vermouth and currants in small saucepan. Bring to boil. Remove from heat. Cover and let steep at least 1 hour and up to 3 hours.
Stir currant mixture, oil, and 1 tablespoon vermouth into onion mixture. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Bring to room temperature before continuing.) Stir in pine nuts.

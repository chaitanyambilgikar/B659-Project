Preheat oven to 375°F.
Make crusts: In a food processor pulse together sugar and flour. Cut butter into small pieces and add to flour mixture, pulsing until mixture forms a crumbly dough, about 15 seconds. Divide dough in half and roll out each half between 2 sheets of wax paper into a 5 1/2-inch round (about 1/4 inch thick). Remove top sheets of wax paper and trim rounds to make perfect circles. Invert rounds onto an ungreased baking sheet and carefully remove remaining sheets of wax paper. Bake rounds in middle of oven until pale golden, about 8 minutes. Cool shortbread on sheet on a rack 5 minutes and transfer to rack to cool completely.
Make lime cream: In a bowl stir together sour cream, sugar, and lime juice.
Peel kiwifruits and cut crosswise into 1/8-inch-thick slices. Spread cream onto shortbread and decoratively top with fruit slices.

Arrange the oven racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 375°F. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone sheets.
In the bowl of an electric mixer, cream the butter and sugars, beating at medium-high speed until fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add the eggs, vanilla, salt and baking soda and beat at medium speed just until the eggs are incorporated, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the flours and mix at low speed just until blended, scraping down the bowl as necessary. Stir in the chocolate chips.
Drop 6 heaping tablespoons of dough on each cookie sheet, spacing the tablespoons of dough evenly apart. Bake for 7 minutes, switch and rotate the pans and bake 5 to 7 minutes more, until the cookies are evenly golden. Let the cookies cool on the pans for a minute or two and then transfer with a spatula to racks to cool completely. Repeat with the remaining dough.

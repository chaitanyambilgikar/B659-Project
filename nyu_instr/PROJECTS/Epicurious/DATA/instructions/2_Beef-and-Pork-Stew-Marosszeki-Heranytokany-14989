Cut beef into 1/2-inch cubes. Finely chop separately bacon and onion. In a 4-quart heavy kettle cook bacon over moderate heat, stirring, until crisp. Add onion and cook until softened. Stir in paprika and water and simmer 5 minutes. Add beef, pepper, caraway seeds, marjoram, and 1/2 cup wine and simmer, covered, stirring occasionally, 30 minutes. Cut pork into 1/2-inch cubes. Add pork, remaining 1/2 cup wine, and salt to taste and simmer, covered, stirring occasionally, until meat is tender, about 2 1/2 hours.
Quarter mushrooms. In a skillet cook mushrooms in lard or oil over moderate heat, stirring, until just tender, about 5 minutes, and add to stew.
Just before serving, in a bowl whisk together sour cream and flour until smooth and stir into stew. Simmer stew, stirring, 5 minutes.

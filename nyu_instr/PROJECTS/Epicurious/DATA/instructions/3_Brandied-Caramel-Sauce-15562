Stir sugar and 2/3 cup water in heavy medium saucepan over medium-low heat until sugar dissolves. Add lemon juice. Increase heat and boil until deep amber, brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush and swirling pan occasionally, about 10 minutes. Remove pan from heat. Stir in remaining 1/4 cup water (mixture will bubble vigorously). Cool 5 minutes. Mix in brandy. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Cover; refrigerate. Rewarm before serving.)

Make biscuits: Preheat oven to 425°F.
Sift together flour, cornmeal, baking powder and soda, salt, and sugar into a bowl and blend in butter with your fingertips until mixture resembles coarse meal.
Stir together sour cream and water, then stir into flour mixture with a fork until just combined.
Drop dough in 4 evenly spaced mounds on a buttered baking sheet and bake in middle of oven until pale golden and cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool biscuits slightly on a rack.
Make filling while biscuits bake: Brown kielbasa in a large heavy skillet over moderate heat, turning it, and transfer to a bowl with a slotted spoon. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon fat from skillet, then cook tomatoes, onion, and jalapeâ€±o, stirring, until tomatoes are softened, 1 to 2 minutes.
Toss tomato mixture with kielbasa and stir in cilantro, lime juice, and salt to taste.
Split warm biscuits and spoon filling and sour cream onto bottom halves. Put tops on biscuits.

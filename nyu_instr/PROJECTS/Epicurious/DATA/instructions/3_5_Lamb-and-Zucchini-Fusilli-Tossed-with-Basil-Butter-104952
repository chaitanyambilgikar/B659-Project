Add lamb; sauté until cooked through, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes. Increase heat to medium-high. Add zucchini and sauté until wilted, about 7 minutes. Add wine, reduce heat, and simmer until reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally. Drain. Return to pot. Add zucchini-lamb mixture and basil butter to pasta; toss to coat. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer pasta to large bowl. Sprinkle with Parmesan.

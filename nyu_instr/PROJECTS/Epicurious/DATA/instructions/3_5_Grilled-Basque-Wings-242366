1. In a large serving bowl, mix together all the ingredients except the chicken wings.
2. You will notice that the wing has two joints. Cut through both joints, separating the wing into three pieces. The wing tip is not usable here, so either toss it out or freeze it and throw it into your next stock, a purpose for which it is excellent.
3. Salt and pepper the wing pieces to taste and whip them onto a medium-hot grill. Turn them occasionally until golden brown, about 5 minutes. To see if they're done, take a big one off the grill and bite into it.
4. When the wings are cooked through, add them to the bowl with the dressing and mix to thoroughly cover. Set them on a platter, open a cold beer, and enjoy yourself.

Preheat oven to 425°F. Flour heavy large baking sheet. Combine first 5 ingredients in large bowl. Add butter and rub in with fingertips until mixture resembles fine meal. Whisk 1 cup buttermilk and dark molasses in medium bowl to blend. Mix buttermilk mixture into dry ingredients. Gradually mix in enough remaining buttermilk to form soft dough. Knead on lightly floured surface just until dough holds together. Shape into 8-inch round, about 1 1/2 inches high. Cut into 4-wedges. Transfer wedges to prepared sheet, spacing apart. Bake until deep golden brown, about 30 minutes. Cool on racks.

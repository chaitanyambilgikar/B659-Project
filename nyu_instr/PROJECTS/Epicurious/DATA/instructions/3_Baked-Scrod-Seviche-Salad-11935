In a large greased jelly-roll pan arrange the scrod fillets in one layer and brush them with the additional oil. Bake the fish in the middle of a preheated 400°F. oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until it just flakes, transfer it to a bowl, and flake it into small pieces.
In another bowl whisk together the citrus juices, the remaining 2 tablespoons oil, the mustard, the Tabasco, the vinegar, the salt, the onion, the scallions, the garlic, the coriander, and pepper to taste, add the fish, and toss the salad well. Line 6 plates with the lettuce, divide the salad among the plates, and serve it with the toast.

In a small bowl whisk together the mustard, the sugar, the shallot, the vinegar, and salt to taste, add the oils in a stream, whisking, and whisk the dressing until it is emulsified. Line a large salad bowl with some of the endive leaves, cut the remaining endives crosswise into 1/2-inch slices, and add them to the bowl with the walnuts. Just before serving, drizzle the salad with the dressing and toss it to combine it well.

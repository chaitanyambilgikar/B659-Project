Cake: 1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Grease and flour a 10-inch Bundt or tube pan.
2. Sift the flour together with the baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon.
3. In another bowl, combine the sugar and oil and mix thoroughly. Add the carrots and blend well.
4. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, to the carrot mixture, beating well after each addition. Fold in the nuts. Then gradually add the flour mixture, blending well.
5. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake for 1 hour, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool before frosting.
Frosting: When the cake is cool, blend together the frosting ingredients and frost.

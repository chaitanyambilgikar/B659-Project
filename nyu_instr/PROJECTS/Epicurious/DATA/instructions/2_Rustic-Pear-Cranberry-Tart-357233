Preheat oven to 425°F. Line heavy rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Melt butter in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add pears. Sauté until almost tender, about 8 minutes. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon sugar; toss 1 minute. Add cranberries, juice concentrate, and jelly. Sauté until pears are tender and juices are thick, 2 to 3 minutes longer. Scrape pear mixture onto large plate and place in freezer 5 minutes to cool quickly.
Unroll dough onto prepared sheet. Cut 1 1/2-inch-wide strip off 1 short end, forming rough 9-inch square. Pull dough strip to twice its length and cut crosswise in half.
Scrape pear mixture into center of dough square. Spread mixture to cover, leaving 1 1/2-inch plain border. Fold up border over edge of filling. Place 2 dough strips diagonally over filling, spacing strips 2 to 3 inches apart; press ends to border to adhere. Sprinkle border and strips with 1 tablespoon sugar.
Bake tart until dough is golden and cooked through, 22 to 23 minutes. Cool to lukewarm on baking sheet.

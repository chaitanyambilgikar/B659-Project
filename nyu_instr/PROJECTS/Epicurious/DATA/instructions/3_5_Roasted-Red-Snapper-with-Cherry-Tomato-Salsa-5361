Preheat oven to 400°F. Whisk oil, 1 tablespoon basil and lime juice in medium bowl to blend. Transfer 1 1/2 tablespoons dressing to small bowl and reserve for fish. Mix remaining 1 tablespoon basil, tomatoes, onion, jalapeño and honey into dressing in medium bowl. Season salsa with salt and pepper.
Lightly brush small baking sheet with oil. Sprinkle both sides of fish with salt and pepper. Arrange fish on prepared sheet; brush with reserved 1 1/2 tablespoons dressing. Roast fish until just opaque in center, about 10 minutes. Transfer fish to 2 plates. Spoon salsa alongside and serve.

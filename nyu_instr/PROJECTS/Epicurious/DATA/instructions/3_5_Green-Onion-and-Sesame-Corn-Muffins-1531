Preheat oven to 425°F. Line 12 muffin cups with foil muffin liners. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in heavy small skillet over medium heat. Add green onions and sauté until beginning to soften, about 1 minute. Add remaining 4 tablespoons butter and stir until just melted. Remove from heat.
Mix cornmeal, flour, sugar, 1/4 cup toasted sesame seeds, baking powder, salt and baking soda in large bowl. Make well in center. Add buttermilk, egg and onion mixture to well. Mix into dry ingredients.
Divide batter among prepared muffin cups. Sprinkle with additional sesame seeds. Bake muffins until golden and firm to touch, about 20 minutes. Transfer to rack. Serve warm or at room temperature.

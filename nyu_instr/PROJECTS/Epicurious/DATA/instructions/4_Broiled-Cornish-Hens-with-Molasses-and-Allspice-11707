Preheat the broiler. In a small bowl stir together the molasses, the lemon juice, the allspice, and salt and pepper to taste. Arrange the hens skin side down on a lightly oiled rack of a broiler pan and brush them with some of the molasses mixture. Broil the hens about 4 inches from the heat, brushing them once with some of the remaining molasses mixture, for 10 minutes, turn them, and broil them for 4 minutes more. Brush the hens with the remaining molasses mixture and broil them for 4 to 5 minutes more, or until they are golden brown and cooked through.

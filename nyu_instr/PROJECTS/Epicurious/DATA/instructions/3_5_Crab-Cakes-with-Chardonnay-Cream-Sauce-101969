Boil wine and shallots in heavy medium saucepan until mixture is reduced to 1/2 cup, about 10 minutes. Add cream and boil until liquid is reduced to sauce consistency, about 10 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Mix crabmeat, 1/2 cup crushed potato chips, breadcrumbs and next 7 ingredients in large bowl until well blended. Using 1/4 cupful crab mixture for each cake, form mixture into sixteen 2 1/2-inch-diameter cakes. (Can be prepared 6 hours ahead. Cover sauce and crab cakes separately and refrigerate. Rewarm sauce over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, before serving.) Place remaining potato chips in shallow dish. Press each cake into chips, turning to coat evenly.
Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Working in batches, add crab cakes to skillet and cook until golden brown and heated through, adding more oil as necessary, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer crab cakes to paper-towel-lined plate to drain.
Place 2 crab cakes on each plate; spoon sauce around crab cakes and then serve immediately.

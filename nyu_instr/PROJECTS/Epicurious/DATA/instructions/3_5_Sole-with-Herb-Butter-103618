Mix butter, chopped herbs and fresh lemon juice in small bowl to blend. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Preheat broiler. Place fish fillets on rimmed baking sheet; brush with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Broil just until opaque in center, about 3 minutes. Spoon butter mixture over fish; broil just until butter melts, about 1 minute longer. Transfer fish to plates, spooning melted butter from pan over fillets. Garnish with dill sprigs and lemon wedges and serve.

Grind together the beets, lemons and apples in a meat grinder, using the coarsest blade. Put in a large pot, add water to come 1" above the mixture and cook, covered, for 1/2 hour, or until the beets are tender. Add remaining ingredients, and simmer uncovered for about 3 hours, or until the beets and lemon rind are translucent. (If the mixture gets dry, add a little water.) Pour into hot, sterilized jelly glasses, cover with a thin layer of melted parafin. When the paraffin has hardened, cover the glasses and store.

Preheat oven to 500°F. Set stone on lowest rack of oven at least 1 hour before baking pizza (if you have a gas stove, stone can go directly on oven floor).3Cook onions in oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat, stirring frequently, until deep golden, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in vinegar, radicchio, and salt and pepper to taste.
Divide dough into quarters on a flour-dusted surface and gently stretch each piece into a thin disk about 6 inches across. Dust baker's peel with cornmeal and put 2 disks on it.
Jerk peel once or twice; if dough sticks, lift and sprinkle more cornmeal underneath. Top each disk on peel with one fourth of onion mixture, goat cheese, and thyme, leaving a 3/4-inch border.
Line up far edge of peel with far edge of stone in oven. Tilt peel, jerking it gently to start pizzas moving, and once edge of pizza touches stone, quickly pull peel back to transfer pizzas to stone. Bake pizzas until dough is crisp and golden, 8 to 12 minutes. Transfer with peel to a cutting board.
Cut pizzas into slices and serve immediately. Make 2 more pizzas in same manner.

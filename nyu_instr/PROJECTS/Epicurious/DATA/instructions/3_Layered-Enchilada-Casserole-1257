Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter 13x9x2-inch glass baking dish. Sauté beef and onion in heavy large Dutch oven over high heat until brown, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to low. Mix in chili powder and jalapeño and sauté 5 minutes. Season mixture with salt and pepper.
Overlap 6 tortillas on bottom of prepared dish, covering completely. Spoon beef mixture, then beans evenly over tortillas. Cover with remaining 6 tortillas. Sprinkle cheese over. Pour tomatoes with their juices over cheese. Bake until casserole is heated through and bubbling at edges, about 1 hour.

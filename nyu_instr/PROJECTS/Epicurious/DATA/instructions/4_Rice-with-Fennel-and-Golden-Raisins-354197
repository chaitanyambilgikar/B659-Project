Cook onion and fennel with raisins, fennel seeds, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in oil in a 4-quart heavy saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until softened, 8 to 10 minutes. Add rice and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add water and bring to a vigorous boil. Tightly cover and cook over low heat, undisturbed, until water is absorbed, about 22 minutes.
Remove from heat. Remove lid and put a clean kitchen towel over pan, then replace lid. Let stand 10 minutes, then fluff with a fork.

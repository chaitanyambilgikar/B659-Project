Pierce kielbasa 4 or 5 times on each side with tip of a sharp knife. Simmer kielbasa in water in a 12-inch heavy skillet, partially covered with lid, over moderately low heat until heated through, about 30 minutes (check after 15 minutes and add a little more water if skillet is almost dry).
Transfer kielbasa with tongs to a cutting board and cut diagonally into 3/4-inch-thick slices. Serve warm or at room temperature.

Combine giblets (reserve liver), neck, 1 chopped celery stalk, celery leaves, parsley sprigs, peppercorns, and bay leaf in a large saucepan. Add 6 cups water; bring to a boil. Lower heat; simmer for 30 minutes. Add liver; simmer until broth measures 4 cups, about 30 minutes longer. Strain; reserve broth. Pick meat from neck and chop giblets; set aside.
Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter a 2-quart baking dish. Cook sausage in a large skillet over medium heat until browned and cooked through, about 10 minutes. Chop parsley leaves and remaining celery in a processor. Add neck meat, giblets, and sausage; pulse just to combine. Transfer to a large bowl; add stuffing mix. Add turkey broth by 1/2 cupfuls, mixing until moist but not wet. Season with salt and pepper; transfer to prepared dish.
Cover dish with foil. Bake until heated through, about 40 minutes. Uncover; dot with butter and bake until browned, about 20 minutes longer.

Melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add ginger and garlic and sauté until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add curry powder; stir 1 minute. Add shrimp, scallops and green onions. Sauté just until shrimp turn pink, about 4 minutes. Add cream and lemon peel. Simmer until shrimp and scallops are just opaque in center and sauce thickens slightly, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Mound rice in large shallow bowl. Top with seafood curry, then cilantro.

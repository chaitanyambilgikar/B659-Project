Line an 8 1/2- by 4 1/2- by 2 1/2-inch metal loaf pan with plastic wrap, leaving a 2 inch overhang on ends, and chill in freezer.
In a food processor coarsely grind peanuts, pulsing motor. In a metal bowl beat eggs and sugar until combined. Set bowl over a saucepan of simmering water and beat egg mixture until thick and pale and registers 140°F on an instant read thermometer. Continue beating mixture over simmering water 3 minutes (for egg safety) and remove bowl from heat. Beat in vanilla and salt.
In a bowl coarsely mash bananas and fold into egg mixture with peanuts. In another bowl beat cream until it just holds stiff peaks and fold into banana mixture gently but thoroughly. Pour mixture into loaf pan. (There should be about 1 cup extra mixture, which may be poured into a smaller pan.) Freeze semifreddo, covered with plastic wrap, at least 8 hours and up to 5 days. Unmold semifreddo onto a platter, discarding plastic wrap, and cut into slices.

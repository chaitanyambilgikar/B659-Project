Preheat oven to 350°F with rack in middle. Oil a 4-sided sheet pan or line with parchment paper.
Stir together oats, almonds, and sesame seeds in a large bowl. Heat oil, honey, cardamom, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a small saucepan over low heat (or in a microwave) until heated through. Stir into oat mixture.
Spread evenly in sheet pan and bake, stirring once, until golden, 20 to 25 minutes.
Cool granola completely in pan (it will crisp as it cools), then stir in fruit.

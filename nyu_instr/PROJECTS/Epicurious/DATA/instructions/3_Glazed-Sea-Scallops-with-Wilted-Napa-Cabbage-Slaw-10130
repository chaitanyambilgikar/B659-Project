In a small bowl, whisk together soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil, sesame oil, and salt and pepper to taste.
In a bowl toss cabbage, carrot, and scallion with 2 tablespoons soy sauce mixture.
Remove tough muscles from side of each scallop if necessary. Pat scallops dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. In a heavy non-stick skillet just large enough to hold scallops in one layer, heat remaining 1/2 tablespoon olive oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and sauté scallops until golden and cooked through, about 2 minutes on each side. Transfer scallops to a bowl. Add remaining soy sauce mixture to skillet and boil until reduced to a glaze. Add glaze to scallops and toss to coat well. Keep scallops warm.
Add slaw to skillet and cook over moderately high heat, stirring, just until cabbage is wilted, 1 to 2 minutes. Season slaw with salt and pepper.
Serve slaw topped with scallops and garnished with scallion greens.

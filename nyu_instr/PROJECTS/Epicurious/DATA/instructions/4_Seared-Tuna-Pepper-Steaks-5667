Press 1/2 teaspoon cracked pepper onto each side of each tuna steak and sprinkle lightly with salt. Heat oil in heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add tuna to skillet and sear until cooked to desired doneness, about 3 1/2 minutes per side for medium. Transfer tuna to plates; tent with foil to keep warm.
Add butter and shallots to same skillet. Sauté over medium heat until shallots soften, about 3 minutes. Remove skillet from heat. Add broth, then brandy. Place skillet over high heat and boil until sauce is reduced to 1/3 cup, about 8 minutes. Season with salt and remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Spoon sauce over tuna.

Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add zucchini, onion and garlic and sautâ€© until zucchini is crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes with juices and simmer until almost all liquid evaporates, about 8 minutes.
Meanwhile, cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite. Drain; return to pot.
Add pesto to pasta and toss to coat. Add zucchini mixture and toss over low heat to combine. Mix in basil. Season pasta with salt and pepper. Transfer pasta to large bowl. Serve, passing Parmesan cheese separately.

Peel apples halfway down from stem end. Core apples without cutting through bottom. Place in broilerproof and microwave-safe casserole. Mix ginger and butter in small bowl. Spoon half of ginger mixture into each apple.
Stir all remaining ingredients except cream in small saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves and syrup boils. Pour syrup over apples. Cover casserole loosely with plastic wrap.
Microwave on high until apples are tender, rotating casserole twice, about 6 minutes. Uncover; spoon juices over.
Preheat broiler. Broil apples until tops are glazed and syrup bubbles, about 2 minutes. Serve apples with whipped cream, if desired.

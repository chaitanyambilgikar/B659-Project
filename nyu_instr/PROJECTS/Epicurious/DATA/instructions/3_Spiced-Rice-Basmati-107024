Bring water, salt, zest, cinnamon stick, and cardamom to a boil in a 2-quart heavy saucepan. Stir in rice and return to a boil, then cover tightly and reduce heat to low. Cook until water is absorbed, about 15 minutes.
Remove from heat and fluff rice with a fork, then cover pan and let stand 5 minutes. Discard zest and cinnamon stick.

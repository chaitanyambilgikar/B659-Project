Sauté bacon in heavy large saucepan over medium heat until crisp, about 6 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towels and drain well. Drain all but 2 tablespoons bacon fat from saucepan. Add onions and thyme to same saucepan and sauté over medium-high heat until onions are light golden, about 10 minutes. Add 4 cups clam juice, 1/2 cup white wine and potatoes. Bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes. Add cream and half of bacon and bring to simmer. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Bring to simmer before continuing.)
Melt 1 tablespoon butter in heavy large skillet over high heat. Add half of scallops and sauté until light golden, about 2 minutes. Add scallops to chowder. Repeat with remaining butter and scallops. Season chowder to taste with salt and pepper.
Ladle chowder into bowls. Sprinkle with paprika and remaining bacon and serve immediately.

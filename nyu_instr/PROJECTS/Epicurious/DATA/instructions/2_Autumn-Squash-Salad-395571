Preheat the oven to 375°. Heat the pickling liquid over medium-high heat in a medium saucepan and add the Hubbard squash ribbons. Simmer until tender, about 5 minutes. Set aside to cool in the liquid.
In a medium-sized roasting pan, toss the kabocha squash wedges with salt, pepper, and a drizzle of olive oil. Roast until tender, about 15 minutes. Set aside.
For the dressing, whisk together the vinegar, honey, and grated garlic in a bowl and slowly add the 1/4 cup olive oil until well mixed.
Here, our fingers are our best tools. Wash your hands and tear the kale into bite-sized pieces and distribute on a platter. Layer on the pickled Hubbard squash, roasted kabocha squash, blanched delicata squash, and the watermelon radish slices. Drizzle on the dressing, then gently run your fingers through the salad to distribute the dressing without breaking the delicate squash slices. Lace a few slices of ham over the top and scatter the toasted pumpkin seeds and cilantro.

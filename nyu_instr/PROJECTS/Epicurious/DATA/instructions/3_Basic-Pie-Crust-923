Combine flour, sugar and salt in processor. Using on/off turns, cut in shortening and butter until mixture resembles coarse meal. Beat egg and 3 tablespoons water in small bowl to blend. Add to flour mixture. Process until moist clumps form, adding more water by teaspoonfuls if dough is dry. Gather into ball. Divide in half. Flatten each half into disk. Wrap in plastic; chill 1 hour. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Keep chilled. Let dough soften slightly at room temperature before rolling.)

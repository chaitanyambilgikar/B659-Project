Combine rice, 1 tablespoon butter, 1 teaspoon sesame oil, 2 1/2 cups water and 1/4 teaspoon salt in large saucepan. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer until rice is tender, stirring once, about 15 minutes.
Add remaining 1 tablespoon butter, chives and sesame seeds to rice. Fluff with fork. Cover and let stand 5 minutes. Fluff rice again. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Brush six 3/4-cup soufflé dishes or custard cups with remaining 2 teaspoons sesame oil. Divide rice among dishes. Pack rice tightly into dishes. Turn timbales out onto plates and serve.

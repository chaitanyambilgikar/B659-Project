Preheat oven to 350°F with racks in upper and lower thirds.
Toast bread chunks in two 4-sided sheet pans in oven until lightly browned, about 15 minutes, then transfer to a large bowl. Leave oven on.
Meanwhile, cook caraway seeds in 6 tablespoons butter in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium-high heat, stirring, until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add celery, apples, onion, garlic, 3/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper and sauté until vegetables are softened and starting to brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Add stock, scraping up any brown bits. Add mixture to bread cubes, tossing to coat.
Transfer to a 3-quart baking dish and dot with remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Bake, uncovered, in upper third of oven until stuffing is crisp on top, about 45 minutes.

Preheat oven to 450°F.
Trim beets, leaving about 1 inch of stems attached (reserve greens for another use). Wrap beets tightly in foil and in a baking pan roast in middle of oven until tender, about 1 hour.
While beets are roasting, on a lightly floured surface with a floured rolling pin roll out dough into a 12-inch round (about 1/8 inch thick). Fit dough into a 9-inch tart pan with a removable fluted rim. Roll rolling pin over top of shell to trim dough flush with rim. Chill shell until firm, about 30 minutes. Unwrap beets carefully. When beets are cool enough to handle, slip off skins and stems. Beets may be roasted 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.
Reduce temperature to 375°F.
Line shell with foil and fill with pie weights or raw rice. On a baking sheet bake shell in middle of oven 30 minutes. Carefully remove weights or rice and foil and bake shell until just golden, about 10 minutes more. Cool shell in pan on a rack. Shell may be made 1 day ahead and kept in pan, covered, at room temperature.
Reduce temperature to 350°F.
Thinly slice beets and arrange in shell. Crumble feta into small pieces and in a bowl whisk together with cream and eggs. Season egg mixture with salt and pepper and pour over beets. Bake tart in middle of oven until filling is set, about 20 minutes, and cool in pan on rack.
If making garnish, peel beet and, using a spiral slicer (see note, this page), shred beet into spirals.
Serve tart garnished with spiral beet shreds.

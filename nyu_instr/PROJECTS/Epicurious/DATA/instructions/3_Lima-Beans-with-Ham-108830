Wrap and tie peppercorns, allspice, savory, and cloves in cheesecloth.
Melt butter in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add onion and sauté until beginning to soften, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes; sauté 3 minutes. Stir in frozen lima beans, ham, mustard, brown sugar, and spice packet. Add broth and boil gently, uncovered, until lima beans are tender and all but 1/2 cup liquid is absorbed, about 25 minutes. Discard spice packet. Stir in hot pepper sauce. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 8 hours ahead. Cool slightly, then cover with plastic wrap and chill. Rewarm in microwave oven before serving.) Transfer to large bowl; sprinkle with parsley.

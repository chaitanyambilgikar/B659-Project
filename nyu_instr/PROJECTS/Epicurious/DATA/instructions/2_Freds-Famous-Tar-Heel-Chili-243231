1. Soak the dried beans according to the package directions and drain. In a pot, combine the beans with enough water to cover by two inches. Bring just to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer the beans until almost tender, about an hour.
2. Set an eight-quart Dutch oven over medium-high heat. In batches, add the beef and pork. Cook, breaking the meat up with a spoon, until well browned (don't crowd the pot or the meat will steam, not brown). Transfer each batch to a bowl using a slotted spoon.
3. Heat the drippings in the same pot over medium heat. Add the bell peppers, onions, chili powder, cumin seeds, and oregano; cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are softened, about 15 minutes. Add the tomatoes with their juice and the reserved meat, and simmer for one hour. Add the beans and simmer until the chili is thickened and the beans are tender, about an hour longer. Stir in the parsley, salt, and pepper. Garnish each serving with onion, cheese, sour cream, and salsa.

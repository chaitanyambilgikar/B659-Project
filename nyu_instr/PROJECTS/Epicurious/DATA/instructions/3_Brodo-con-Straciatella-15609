In a small bowl, stir together the eggs, cheese, pinch of salt, the nutmeg, and flour — try not to get the eggs at all frothy.
In a medium saucepan, bring the stock to a boil. Place a colander with widely spaced holes over the boiling stock. Pour the egg mixture through the colander. Remove the colander and stir the soup once or twice. Remove from the heat or, if using the greens, lower the heat and stir them in just to heat through. Remove from the heat and season with salt and pepper. Serve immediately.

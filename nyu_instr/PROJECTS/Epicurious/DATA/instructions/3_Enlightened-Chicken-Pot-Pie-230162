Preheat oven to 450°F. Bring 1 cup broth to a boil in a large pot. Add onion and cook 3 minutes, until soft, then add remaining 1 cup broth, potatoes and thyme. Bring to a boil and cook 8 minutes, until potatoes are tender. Meanwhile, combine cornstarch and 1 cup skim milk and stir until smooth. To cornstarch-milk mixture, add zucchini, yellow squash, red and green peppers, mushrooms, salt, pepper, mustard, and Worcestershire. Bring to a boil and cook about 5 minutes. Stir in chicken and remove from heat. Pour into a 9" deep-dish pie plate. To make the topping, combine Bisquick and skim milk in a bowl. Using hands, lay topping over filling surface and tap it down. Bake 15 minutes or until top is golden.

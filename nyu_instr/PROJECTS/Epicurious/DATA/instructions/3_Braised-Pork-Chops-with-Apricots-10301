In a heavy skillet heat the oil over moderately high heat until it is hot but not smoking, in it brown the pork chops, patted dry and seasoned with salt and pepper, and transfer them to a plate. Add 1 tablespoon of the butter to the skillet and in it cook the shallot, the cumin, the ground coriander, the zest, and the gingerroot over moderately low heat, stirring, until the shallot is softened. Add the wine, the broth, and the apricots, bring the liquid to a simmer, and in it braise the pork chops, covered, over moderately low heat for 20 minutes, or until they are tender. Transfer the chops to a serving plate with a slotted spatula and keep them warm. In a small bowl stir together well the remaining 1/2 tablespoon butter, softened, and the flour until the mixture is well combined, add the beurre manié to the braising liquid, and bring the sauce to a boil, stirring. Simmer the sauce for 1 to 2 minutes, or until it is thickened, stir in the fresh coriander and salt and pepper to taste, and pour the sauce over the pork chops.

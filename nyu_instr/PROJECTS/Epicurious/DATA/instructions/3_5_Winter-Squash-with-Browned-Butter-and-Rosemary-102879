Steam squash until almost tender when pierced with fork, about 5 minutes. Cool squash slightly. Melt butter in large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Continue to cook until butter is golden brown and aromatic, about 2 minutes. Add squash and rosemary and toss until squash is tender, heated through and coated with browned butter, about 3 minutes. Season generously with salt and pepper.

Marinate chicken hearts in the following mixture: To equal parts of soy sauce and sherry wine add 2 crushed cloves of garlic, 1 teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper and 1 teaspoon of ground ginger. Let the hearts soak for an hour or two before cooking. Arrange 3 to 4 chicken hearts on each small skewer and grill them until nicely brown on all sides. Bamboo chopsticks can be whittled down to make excellent skewers. Soak them in water for an hour before using or they will burn and char.

1. Coarsely grate the sweet potatoes, preferably using the grating disk of a food processor. (You should have about 5 cups.)
2. Heat the oil in a large skillet over high heat until hot. Reduce the heat to medium-high; add the sweet potatoes and cumin and sauté, stirring constantly, until the potatoes are almost tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the chipotle, pepitas, and salt and pepper to taste. Cook for 2 minutes more or until the sweet potatoes are tender.

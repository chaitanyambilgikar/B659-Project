Make a crosswise cut halfway through 1 potato, then break it apart. Turn potato cut sides down, then cut and break halves in same manner. Repeat halving and breaking until pieces are about 1 1/2 inches. Repeat with remaining potatoes.
Heat oil in a 12-inch heavy nonstick skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then sauté potatoes with salt, turning occasionally, until browned and just cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer potatoes with a slotted spoon to a bowl, reserving oil in skillet.
Cut a 1 1/2-inch lengthwise slit in each chile, then add to skillet along with onion, peppers, and chorizo and reduce heat to moderate. Cook, uncovered, stirring frequently, until vegetables are softened, 5 to 6 minutes. Add wine and boil until reduced to about 1/4 cup, 3 to 4 minutes. Discard chiles, then add pepper mixture to potatoes along with salt and pepper to taste and toss well. Serve warm or at room temperature.

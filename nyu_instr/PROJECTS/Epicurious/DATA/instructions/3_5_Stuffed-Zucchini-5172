Preheat the oven to 375°F.
Scoop out the insides of the zucchini halves with a small spoon. Reserve the cored halves and the insides.
Heat the oil in a large sauté pan over medium heat and sauté for 1 to 2 minutes. Then add the mushrooms and sauté for 2 minutes more. Add the celery and the reserved insides of the zucchini and continue to cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the white wine and cook it down for 1 minute. Add the veal and cook, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, until it browns nicely, approximately 8 minutes. Stir in the basil and the rosemary and cook for 1 to 2 minutes more. Remove from the heat, place in a bowl, and allow to cool.
Once the mixture has cooled, blend in the cheese, egg, butter, salt, and pepper. Fill the cored zucchini with the mixture.
Fill a baking pan with 1/4 inch of water. Place the filled zucchini halves in the pan and bake for 40 minutes, until golden brown. Remove the zucchini carefully from the pan to a warm platter, spooning the juices from the pan on top of them, and serve.

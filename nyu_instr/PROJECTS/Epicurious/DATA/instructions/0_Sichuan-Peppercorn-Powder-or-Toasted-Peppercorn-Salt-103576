For peppercorn powder: Shake peppercorns in a sieve to get rid of dust, then spread in batches on a white plate and discard any twigs, leaves, thorns, or black inner seeds.
Toast peppercorns in a dry heavy skillet over moderate heat, stirring, until very fragrant and smoking, 3 to 5 minutes (be careful not to let them burn).
Grind, while still hot, to a powder in an electric coffee/spice grinder and sift through a fine sieve, discarding hulls.

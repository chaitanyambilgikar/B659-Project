1. Preheat the oven to 350°F.
2. Make the croutons: In a medium bowl, combine the oil, cheese, garlic, oregano, and thyme. Add the bread and toss, coating all the croutons.
3. Arrange the croutons in a single layer on a baking tray and bake until golden, turning to brown all sides. Cool and store in a cool, dry place.
4. Make the salad: Trim the lettuce and toss with some of the Caesar Vinaigrette . Arrange on salad plates and sprinkle with a little Parmesan cheese, if desired.
5. Spread one side of your croutons with a thin layer of the Black and Green Olive Tapenade . Arrange atop the salads and serve immediately.

Make lemon curd: In a metal bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water cook sugar, butter, eggs, lemon juice, and zest, whisking frequently, until curd is thick enough to hold marks of whisk and the first bubble appears on surface, 12 to 15 minutes. Strain curd through a sieve into a bowl and cool. Chill curd, covered, until ready to use. Lemon curd may be made 1 week in advance and kept covered and chilled.
Make shell: In a food processor pulse flour, confectioners' sugar, butter, and a pinch of salt until mixture resembles coarse meal. In a small bowl stir together sour cream, egg yolk, and vanilla until combined well and add to flour mixture. Process mixture until a ball of dough is formed. Shape dough into a thick disk and chill, wrapped in plastic wrap, at least 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375°F.
On a floured surface roll out dough 3/8 inch thick and cut on an 11-inch circle. Transfer dough with 2 spatulas to baking sheet. Crimp edge decoratively and chill dough 20 minutes.
Prick shell all over with a fork and bake in middle of oven until pale golden, 15 to 17 minutes. Cool shell completely on baking sheet on rack.
Assemble tart: Spread lemon curd evenly on shell, leaving a 1-inch border, and arrange strawberries on it. The tart may be assembled up to this point 3 hours in advance and kept covered.
Whip cream and spoon into a pastry bag fitted with a large star tip. Pipe rosettes of cream between strawberries and transfer tart to platter.

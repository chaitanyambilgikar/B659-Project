Preheat oven to 400°F. Generously butter 8x8-inch glass baking dish with 2-inch-high sides. Combine cream, half and half, fresh fennel and fennel seeds in heavy large skillet. Thinly slice potatoes and add to skillet. Bring mixture to boil over high heat, stirring frequently to separate vegetables slices. Boil 5 minutes. Season generously with salt and pepper. Transfer half of potato mixture to prepared baking dish. Sprinkle half of Gouda over. Top with remaining, potato mixture. Firmly press mixture down. Sprinkle remaining Gouda over. Cover dish tightly with foil. Bake until potatoes are tender, about 40 minutes. Uncover and bake until top is golden brown, about 10 minutes longer. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.

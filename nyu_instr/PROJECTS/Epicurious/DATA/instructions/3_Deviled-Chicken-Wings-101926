Cut off wing tips, reserving for another use, and halve wings at joint. Discard crusts from bread and in a food processor finely grind bread. Measure out 1 1/2 cups bread crumbs, reserving remainder for another use. With a mortar and pestle or in an electric coffee/spice grinder coarsely grind mustard seeds.
Preheat oven to 450°F and oil rack of a broiler pan.
In a large bowl whisk together mustard seeds, mustard, oil, vinegar, salt, and cayenne. Add wings and stir to coat. In a shallow dish stir together bread crumbs and Parmesan. Press wings, thick-skin sides down, into bread-crumb mixture to coat and arrange, crumb sides up, on rack.
Roast wings in middle of oven until cooked through and golden, about 30 minutes. Serve chicken wings warm or at room temperature.

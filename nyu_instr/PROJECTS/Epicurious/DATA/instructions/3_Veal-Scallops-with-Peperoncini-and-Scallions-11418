Pat veal scallops dry and season with salt and pepper. Dredge veal in flour, shaking off excess, and arrange in one layer on a sheet of wax paper.
In a large heavy skillet heat oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and sauté veal in batches without crowding 30 seconds on each side, or until pale golden, transferring with tongs to a platter.
Add vermouth or wine to skillet and deglaze over high heat, stirring and scraping up brown bits. Add peperoncini and scallions and boil mixture 1 minute. Add butter and salt and pepper to taste and cook sauce, swirling skillet, until butter is just melted. Return veal to skillet with any juices accumulated on platter and coat with sauce.

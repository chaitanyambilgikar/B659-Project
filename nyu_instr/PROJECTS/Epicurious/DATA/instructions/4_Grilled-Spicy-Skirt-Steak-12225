Prepare grill if using.
Cut steak into large pieces to fit on a grill or in a ridged grill pan.
In a small bowl stir together chili powder, cumin, garlic paste, Worcestershire sauce, sugar, pepper, allspice, and oil and rub all over meat. Marinate meat in a resealable plastic bag, chilled, 20 minutes.
Grill steak on a well-oiled rack set about 4 inches over glowing coals or in hot well-seasoned ridged grill pan over moderately high heat 3 to 5 minutes on each side, or until just springy to touch, for medium-rare meat. Let steak stand on a cutting board 5 minutes and cut across grain on the diagonal into thin slices.
Serve steak with tortillas.

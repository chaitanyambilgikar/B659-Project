Combine teriyaki sauce, wine and garlic in glass pie dish. Add chicken and turn to coat. Cover and refrigerate 3 hours, turning chicken occasionally.
Prepare barbeque (medium-high heat) or preheat broiler. Remove chicken from marinade. Wrap each chicken piece with 2 strips of bacon, covering completely and securing ends with toothpicks. Grill until chicken is firm to touch and just cooked through, and bacon is crisp, turning occasionally, about 15 minutes. Transfer chicken to platter.

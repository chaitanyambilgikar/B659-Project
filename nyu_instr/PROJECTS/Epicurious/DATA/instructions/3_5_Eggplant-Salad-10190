Preheat broiler.
In a blender, blend oil, lemon juice, mustard, garlic paste, and half of basil until smooth. In a measuring cup, reserve 1/4 cup dressing and in a large bowl, toss remaining dressing with eggplant slices.
Arrange half of eggplant slices in one layer on a large baking sheet and broil about 4 inches from heat until golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Turn slices and broil until golden, 5 to 7 minutes more. Transfer eggplant slices to a plate to cool and broil remaining eggplant slices in same manner.
Arrange eggplant and remaining basil on a platter. Drizzle salad with reserved dressing and sprinkle with pine nuts.

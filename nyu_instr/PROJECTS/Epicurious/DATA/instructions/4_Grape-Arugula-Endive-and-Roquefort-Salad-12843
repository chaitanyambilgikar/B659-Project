In a small bowl whisk together the vinegar and the mustard and add salt and pepper to taste. Add the oil in a stream, whisking, and whisk the dressing until it is emulsified. Divide the arugula among 4 salad plates, top it with the endive and the watercress, and arrange the grapes and the Roquefort over the greens. Drizzle the dressing over the salads.

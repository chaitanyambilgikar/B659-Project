Halve shallots lengthwise. Pull tough outer leaves (about 5 layers) from artichokes so they resemble tight rosebuds. Cut off top third of each artichoke and discard. Trim stem ends and halve artichokes through stems.
In a large heavy skillet heat oil and butter over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and sauté artichokes and shallots, stirring occasionally, until golden. Add broth and simmer, covered, 15 minutes, or until artichokes are almost tender. Add wine and boil, uncovered, until liquid is evaporated.
Toss braised vegetables with parsley and season with salt and pepper.

Preheat oven to 400°F.
In a saucepan bring broth and wine to a boil and stir in saffron. Keep mixture at a simmer. In a heavy ovenproof skillet measuring 8 inches across the bottom heat oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and sauté uncooked pasta, stirring, until golden, about 2 minutes. Pour simmering broth mixture over pasta and simmer 5 minutes.
Nestle shellfish and artichoke hearts into pasta and bake, uncovered, in middle of oven until liquid is reduced to a syrupy glaze (pasta should be tender but crisp on top), about 20 minutes.
Sprinkle pasta with chives.

Cover, reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until beef is almost tender, approximately 1 hour.
Stir in carrots. Simmer uncovered until carrots and meat are very tender and stew is slightly thickened, approximately 45 minutes or less
Stir in peas, parsley, remaining 1 tablespoon thyme and remaining 2 teaspoon rosemary. Cover and simmer until peas are tender, about 5 minutes.

Sprinkle gelatin over 3 tablespoons milk in a small bowl and let soften while making custard.
Bring remaining milk just to a boil in a small heavy saucepan, then remove from heat. Whisk together egg and 1/4 cup sugar until combined well, then add hot milk in a slow stream, whisking.
Pour custard into pan and cook over moderately low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until an instant-read thermometer registers 170°F and custard coats back of spoon (do not boil), about 2 minutes. Stir in gelatin mixture and cook over low heat, stirring, until dissolved, about 1 minute (do not boil). Pour custard through a sieve into a bowl and cool, stirring occasionally.
Purée mangoes with remaining 1/4 cup sugar and lime juice in a blender until very smooth and force through sieve into custard. Stir until combined well, then chill until cold but not set, about 1 hour.
Beat cream with an electric mixer until it just holds stiff peaks, then fold into mango custard gently but thoroughly. Chill, covered, at least 8 hours.
Before serving, spoon fool into 6 dishes.

• Preheat the oven to 350°F. Lightly butter a 9 x 13-inch pan and line with parchment paper, allowing enough overhang on the long side to lift the bars from the pan.
• Place the butter and graham crackers in a bowl and combine well. Transfer the mixture to the prepared pan and pat into an even layer to form the crust.
• Sprinkle the coconut evenly over the crust. Sprinkle the chocolate chips over the coconut. Pour the condensed milk evenly over the chocolate chips. Sprinkle the pecans evenly over the condensed milk layer. Press the layers down lightly. Transfer to the oven and bake until lightly browned, about 30 minutes.
• Set aside to cool completely and cut into 24 pieces.

With a cleaver or poultry shears halve chicken breasts and cut each half crosswise into 4 pieces. If using chicken legs, cut each leg into 2 pieces, drumstick and thigh. (You may instead ask your butcher to cut up the chicken.)
With a mortar and pestle or in a small food processor pound or blend peppercorns and garlic with a pinch salt to a smooth paste. Add coriander roots and pound or blend to a paste. In a large bowl stir together coriander paste, fish sauce, and coconut milk. Add chicken and turn to coat well with marinade. Marinate chicken, covered, at room temperature 45 minutes.
Prepare grill (or preheat broiler).
Grill chicken, skin sides down, on a lightly oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals until browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Brush top of chicken lightly with marinade, discarding any remaining marinade, and turn chicken. Grill chicken until just cooked through and juices run clear, 7 to 10 minutes more. (Alternatively, chicken may be broiled in same manner on lightly oiled rack of a large broiler pan about 4 to 6 inches from heat.)
Serve chicken with dipping sauce and rice.

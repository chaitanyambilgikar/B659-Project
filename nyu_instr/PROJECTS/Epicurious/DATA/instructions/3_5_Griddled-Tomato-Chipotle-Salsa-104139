Place a large cast-iron skillet over high heat for about 3 minutes, or until smoking. Add the tomatoes to the skillet and char on both sides until black and somewhat soft, about 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the skillet and set aside. Reduce the heat to medium, and after two minutes, pour the olive oil into the skillet. Immediately add the onions, jalapeños, and garlic and sauté for about 3 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are soft. Transfer the onion mixture to a food processor with the griddled tomatoes. Process until all the ingredients are well blended. Transfer to a mixing bowl, add the chile puree, cilantro, lime juice, and salt, and stir well to combine. Serve at room temperature. Keeps for up to 1 week, refrigerated.

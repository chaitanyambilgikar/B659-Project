Mash garlic to a paste with salt using a mortar and pestle (or mince and mash with a large knife). Blend garlic paste, bread, and almonds in a food processor until nuts are very finely chopped. Add oil in a slow stream with motor running, blending until thick and smooth. Add tomatoes and 2 tablespoons vinegar and blend until as smooth as possible, about 1 minute. Force soup through a sieve into a bowl, pressing firmly on solids. Discard solids.

Halve shrimp lengthwise by cutting down middle of backs and cook in a saucepan of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until just cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain in a colander and spread on a large plate to cool.
Whisk together vinegar, garlic, ginger, and oil, then add shrimp and remaining ingredients and toss to combine well. Season salad with salt and pepper.
* These long, narrow cucumbers are often marketed as "European" and are usually sold in plastic wrap to protect their thin, delicate, unwaxed skin.

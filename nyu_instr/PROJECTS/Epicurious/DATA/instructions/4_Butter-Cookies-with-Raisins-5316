Using electric mixer, beat butter, sugar and salt in large bowl until creamy. Mix in vanilla. Add flour and raisins; mix until smooth dough forms. Divide dough in half. Shape each dough half into 1 1/2-inch-diameter log. Wrap each log in plastic; refrigerate until firm, about 2 hours. (Can be made 3 days ahead. Keep chilled.)
Preheat oven to 375°F. Butter 2 large baking sheets. Cut each dough log into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Place slices on prepared baking sheets, spacing 1 inch apart. Bake until cookies are golden, about 10 minutes. Cool slightly on baking sheets. Transfer to racks; cool completely. (Can be made 3 days ahead. Store in airtight container at room temperature.)

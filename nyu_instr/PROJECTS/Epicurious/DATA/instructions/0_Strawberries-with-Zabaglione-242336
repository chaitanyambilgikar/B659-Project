Divide strawberries among 6 stemmed glasses.
Beat together yolks, sugar, and Marsala in a large metal bowl with a whisk or handheld electric mixer until combined, then put bowl over a saucepan of barely simmering water and continue to beat until thickened and tripled in volume, 2 to 4 minutes.
Spoon over strawberries and serve immediately.

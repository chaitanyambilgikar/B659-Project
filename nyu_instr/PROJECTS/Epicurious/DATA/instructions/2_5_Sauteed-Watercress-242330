Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers, then cook pine nuts with 1/4 teaspoon salt, stirring, until golden, about 2 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to a small bowl.
Add remaining tablespoon oil to skillet, then sauté garlic, coriander, red-pepper flakes, and 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and pepper over medium-high heat until spices are fragrant, about 30 seconds.
Add watercress and sauté, turning with tongs, until wilted, 3 to 4 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Serve sprinkled with pine nuts.

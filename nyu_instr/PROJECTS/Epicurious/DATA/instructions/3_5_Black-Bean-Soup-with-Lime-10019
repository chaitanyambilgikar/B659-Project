In a 5-quart kettle simmer ham hock in 3 quarts water, covered, 1 hour. Add beans, onion, and bay leaf and simmer, uncovered, 1 hour, or until beans are just tender. Stir in tomatoes with juice, salt, and remaining cup water and simmer soup 45 minutes, or until beans are tender. Soup may be made 1 day ahead, cooled completely, and chilled, covered.
Remove ham hock and reserve for another use. Discard bay leaf and stir in lime juice to taste. Divide soup among 8 bowls and garnish with lime slices.

1. Season chicken with salt and pepper. Melt butter in a large frying pan over medium-high heat; add chicken and stir. Cook for 5 minutes. Add wine, garlic, and potatoes. Cover and cook for an additional 5 minutes or until potatoes are soft and wine has cooked out.
2. Remove cover and add mushrooms. Stir to combine. Continue cooking until mushrooms are soft. Add peas, parsley, and paprika; stir to combine. Cook until well-blended, being careful not to mash the vegetables. Season to taste with white pepper.

Halve zucchini lengthwise and cut crosswise into 1/2-inch pieces. In a steamer set over simmering water steam zucchini, covered, until just tender, about 5 minutes.
In a bowl toss zucchini with sesame oil and seeds, soy sauce, and salt to taste until coated well and sprinkle with lemon juice. Serve warm or at room temperature.

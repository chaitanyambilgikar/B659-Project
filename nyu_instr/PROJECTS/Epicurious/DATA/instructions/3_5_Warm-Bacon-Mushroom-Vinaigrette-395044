Cut 4 ounces bacon (about 4 slices) into 1/2"-wide strips. Cook bacon with 3 tablespoons water in a medium skillet over medium heat, stirring often, until bacon starts to crisp. Add 2 cups sliced mushrooms; cook, tossing occasionally, until tender, 5-6 minutes. Add 3 tablespoons Sherry vinegar and 1/4 cup water; simmer until reduced by half, about 1 minute. Stir in 2 tablespoons vegetable oil. Season with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Stir in 2 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Rewarm before using.

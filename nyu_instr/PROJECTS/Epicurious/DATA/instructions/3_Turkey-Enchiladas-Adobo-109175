Preheat oven to 350°F. Stack tortillas and wrap in foil. Warm in oven until heated through, about 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat oil in 12-inch ovenproof skillet over medium heat. Add onion and sauté until soft, about 5 minutes. Stir in enchilada sauce, 2 tablespoons cilantro, and chopped chiles. Simmer over medium heat 5 minutes to blend flavors, stirring often.
While enchilada sauce simmers, mix turkey, 1/2 cup bell peppers, 2 tablespoons cilantro, and 1 teaspoon adobo sauce in small bowl. Unwrap tortillas and arrange in single layer on work surface. Fill each tortilla with about 1/4 cup turkey mixture and roll up.
Preheat broiler. Place enchiladas, seam side down, in simmering sauce, spooning some sauce over each. Remove from heat. Sprinkle with cheese and remaining 1/4 cup bell peppers. Place skillet in broiler and cook until enchiladas are heated through and cheese is melted, about 4 minutes.
Sprinkle enchiladas with remaining 2 tablespoons cilantro and serve.

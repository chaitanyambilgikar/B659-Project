Scrub clams well. Finely chop shallot. In a large saucepan cook shallot in 1/4 tablespoon butter over moderate heat, stirring, until softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Add beer and clams and steam clams, covered, until opened, 4 to 5 minutes, transferring them as they open with a slotted spoon to a bowl. Discard any unopened clams and reserve cooking liquid. Keep clams warm.
Pour reserved cooking liquid through a paper-towel–lined sieve into a small saucepan. Heat cooking liquid over moderate heat until hot and whisk in remaining 3‚ tablespoons butter. Remove pan from heat and stir in parsley and salt.
Serve clams with dipping sauce.

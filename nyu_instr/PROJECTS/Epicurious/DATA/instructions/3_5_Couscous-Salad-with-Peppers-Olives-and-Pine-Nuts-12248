In a small saucepan bring water to a boil with currants or raisins, salt, and 1 tablespoon oil. Stir in couscous and let stand, covered, off heat 5 minutes. Fluff couscous with a fork and transfer to bowl.
In a small skillet cook garlic in 2 tablespoons oil over moderate heat, stirring, until pale golden. Add onion and cook, stirring, until softened. Stir onion mixture into couscous with vinegar, bell peppers, olives, capers, pine nuts, parsley, remaining 1 tablespoon oil, and salt and pepper to taste. Salad may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered. Bring salad to room temperature before serving.
To roast peppers: Using a long-handled fork, char peppers over an open flame, turning, until skins are blackened, 2 to 3 minutes. (Or broil peppers on rack of a broiler pan under a preheated broiler about 2 inches from heat, turning every 5 minutes, until skins are blistered and charred, 15 to 25 minutes.) Transfer peppers to a bowl and let stand, covered, until cool enough to handle. Keeping peppers whole, peel them, starting at blossom end. Cut off tops and discard seeds and ribs.

Place first 3 ingredients in processor. Chop finely using on/off turns. Heat oil in heavy large saucepan over medium heat. Add chopped vegetables and sauté until tender and beginning to brown, about 15 minutes. Add tomatoes, reserved juices, herbs and sugar. Season with salt and pepper. Cover partially and simmer until tomato sauce thickens, stirring occasionally, about 35 minutes.( Can be prepared up to 1 month ahead. Freeze.)
Whisk 2 eggs with 1 teaspoon water until well blended. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in nonstick skillet over medium heat. Pour egg mixture into skillet. Using spatula, lift edges of eggs as they cook, letting uncooked part run underneath until omelet is cooked but still creamy. Spoon 2 tablespoons tomato sauce over half of omelet. Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons mozzarella. Slide out onto plate, folding omelet over filling. Keep warm. Repeat process with remaining eggs, water, butter, sauce and cheese. Spoon any remaining tomato sauce over omelets.

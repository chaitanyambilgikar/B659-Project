Preheat oven to 350°F. Combine first 4 ingredients in processor and blend. Add butter and vanilla and cut in until mixture resembles fine meal, using on/off turns. Add pecans and process until finely chopped. Add chocolate chips and ginger and mix in.
Transfer mixture to bowl and gather together. Divide into thirds. Roll 1 piece out between sheets of waxed paper to thickness of 1/4 inch. Cut out cookies, using 3-inch heart-shaped cutter. Transfer to ungreased cookie sheets. Gather scraps. Repeat rolling and cutting with remaining dough. Re-roll scraps and cut additional cookies. Sprinkle cookies with sugar. Bake until just beginning to color, about 20 minutes. Cool on sheets on rack 5 minutes. Transfer cookies to rack and cool. (Cookies can be prepared 3 days ahead. Store in airtight container.)

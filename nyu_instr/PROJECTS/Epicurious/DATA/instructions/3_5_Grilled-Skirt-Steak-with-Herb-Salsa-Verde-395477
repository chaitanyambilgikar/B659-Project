Mix 1/4 cup oil, garlic, and lemon zest in a medium bowl; season with salt and pepper. Let marinate for 20 minutes. Add all herbs to oil mixture; stir until well coated. Let stand until herbs begin to wilt, about 10 minutes. Stir in remaining 1/4 cup oil. Season herb salsa verde to taste with salt and pepper.
Build a medium-hot fire in a charcoal grill, or heat a gas grill to high. Season skirt steak generously with salt and pepper and grill until charred, 2 minutes per side for medium-rare. Transfer steak to a serving platter; let rest for 5 minutes, allowing juices to accumulate on platter.
Transfer skirt steak to a cutting board and slice against the grain on a diagonal. Season to taste with salt; return to platter with juices. Spoon half of herb salsa verde over. Serve with lemon wedges. Pass remaining herb salsa verde alongside.

Purée pineapple in a blender until very smooth. Force through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, pressing hard on and then discarding solids. (You should have about 1 3/4 cups juice.)
Return pineapple juice to blender and add remaining ingredients, except bitters, then pulse until smooth and foamy.
Pour over ice in glasses. Add a drop of bitters to center of each drink.

For broth: Bring first 5 ingredients to boil in medium saucepan over medium heat, stirring until sugar dissolves. Mix in cilantro, cinnamon, coriander, and chile. Remove from heat; steep 45 minutes. Strain into bowl. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Chill. Bring to room temperature before using.)
For noodles and garnishes: Place noodles in large bowl. Add boiling water to cover. Let stand until noodles are soft, separating occasionally, about 10 minutes. Drain; return noodles to bowl. (Can be prepared 4 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature. Before using, cover with warm water; drain well.)
Pour 1/4 cup broth into each of 6 shallow bowls. Top with sprouts, noodles, Peanut-Sesame Sauce, apple, cucumber, green onions, and ginger. Garnish with apples, peanuts, and sesame seeds.

Place the beans in a large bowl with 4 cups of water and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt. Cover and refrigerate for 8 to 12 hours. Drain and rinse the beans. Discard any loose skins.
Place the beans in a 6-quart pressure cooker with ample water to cover and add the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. (Take care not to exceed the maximum fill-line of the cooker.) Over medium-high heat, bring to a boil uncovered. Reduce the heat to a simmer, and skim off any whitish gray foam on top. Bring to a boil again, reduce the heat to a simmer, and skim off most of the remaining foam. Rinse any beans that come out of the pot with the skimmer and return them to the pot. Add the garlic, onion, kombu (if using), and oil.
Lock the lid in place and over high heat, bring to high pressure. Reduce the heat just enough to maintain high pressure and cook for 20 minutes. Allow the pressure to come down naturally, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove the lid, tilting it away from you to allow any excess steam to escape.
If the beans are not tender, set (but do not lock) the lid in place and simmer them until done. Remove the onion and kombu and discard (or chop up and munch). Drain, reserving the cooking liquid if you wish, and refrigerate the beans and liquid separately for up to 3 days or freeze separately for up to 2 months.

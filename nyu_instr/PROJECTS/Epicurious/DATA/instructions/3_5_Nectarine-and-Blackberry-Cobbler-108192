Preheat oven to 425°F.
Whisk together 1 1/4 cups sugar and cornstarch in a large bowl, then add nectarines and blackberries and toss to combine well. Transfer to buttered baking dish and bake in middle of oven until hot, 10 to 15 minutes.
While fruit bakes, whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt in another large bowl, then blend in butter with your fingertips or a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add milk and stir just until a dough forms.
Drop dough onto hot fruit mixture in 6 mounds, then sprinkle dough with remaining 1/2 teaspoon sugar. Bake cobbler in middle of oven until top is golden, 25 to 35 minutes.

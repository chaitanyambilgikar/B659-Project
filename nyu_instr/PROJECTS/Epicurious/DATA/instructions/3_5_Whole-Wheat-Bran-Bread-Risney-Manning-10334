In a bowl combine the bran, the flour, the salt, the baking soda, and the brown sugar. In another bowl stir together the buttermilk and the molasses, stir the mixture into the flour mixture until the batter is combined well, and stir in the raisins. Spoon the batter into a lightly greased loaf pan, 8 by 4 by 3 inches, and bake it in the middle of a preheated 350°F. oven for 1 hour to 1 hour and 10 minutes, or until the bread sounds hollow when tapped. Let the bread cool in the pan on a rack for 15 minutes, invert it onto the rack, and let it cool completely.

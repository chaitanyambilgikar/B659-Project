Preheat oven to 275°F.
In a large bowl, combine all ingredients to form uniform dough. On a cutting board or work surface, roll out dough to 1/8-inch thickness, and cut out shapes with cookie cutters or the rims of various-size cups to make circles. The dough can also be rolled out in logs, then sliced into disks.
Place the cookies on ungreased baking sheets, sprinkle with colored sugar, if desired, and bake until lightly golden, about l5 minutes. Allow cookies to cool slightly, then transfer to racks to cool completely. Dust with confectioners' sugar, if desired. Store cookies in airtight container.

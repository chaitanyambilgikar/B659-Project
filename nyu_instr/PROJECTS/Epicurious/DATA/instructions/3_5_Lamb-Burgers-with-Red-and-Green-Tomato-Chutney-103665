Prepare grill for cooking.
Make chutney: Boil vinegar, syrup, garlic, ginger, cumin, and red pepper flakes in a small saucepan until thickened and reduced to about 2 tablespoons, 2 to 3 minutes (watch carefully). Remove from heat and stir in tomatoes and salt to taste. Stir in cilantro just before serving.
Make burgers: Form lamb into 4 (3/4-inch-thick) patties and season with salt and pepper. Grill on a lightly oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals about 4 minutes on each side for medium-rare.
Serve burgers with chutney.

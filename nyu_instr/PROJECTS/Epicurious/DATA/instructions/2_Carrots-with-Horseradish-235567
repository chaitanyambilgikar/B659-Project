Peel carrots and combine with ice water and lemon juice in a 13- by 9-inch glass or ceramic baking dish, then let stand about 20 minutes.
Stir together cream, yogurt, horseradish, and salt in a bowl.
Drain carrots and pat dry. Thinly slice crosswise (less than 1/3 inch thick) with slicer. Toss with horseradish cream and chill, covered, stirring occasionally, 1 hour.

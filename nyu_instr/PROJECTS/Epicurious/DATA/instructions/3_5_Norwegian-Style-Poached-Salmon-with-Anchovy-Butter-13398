In a small bowl combine well the butter, the parsley, the anchovy paste, and freshly ground black pepper to taste and reserve the anchovy butter, covered. In a saucepan combine the onion, the vinegar, the sugar, the peppercorns, the coriander seeds, the mustard seeds, the salt, and 4 cups water, bring the mixture to a boil, and simmer if for 15 minutes. Strain the mixture through a fine sieve into a deep heavy skillet just large enough to hold the salmon in one layer. Add the salmon, bring the liquid to a simmer, and poach the salmon, covered, for 8 to 10 minutes, or until it just flakes. Transfer the salmon steaks with a slotted spatula to plates, letting the poaching liquid drain off, and divide the reserved anchovy butter between them.

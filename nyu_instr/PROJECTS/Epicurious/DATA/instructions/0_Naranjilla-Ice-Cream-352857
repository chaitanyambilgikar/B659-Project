Bring purée, cream, milk, and 3/4 cup sugar to a simmer in a heavy medium saucepan over medium heat, stirring until sugar has dissolved.
Whisk together yolks and remaining 1/4 cup sugar in a bowl, then slowly add hot milk mixture, whisking to combine. Return mixture to saucepan and cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until custard is slightly thickened and registers 170 to 175°F on an instant-read thermometer (do not let boil). Immediately strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a metal bowl.
Chill, uncovered, until cool or quick-chill by setting bowl in an ice bath and stirring occasionally until cold. Refrigerate, covered, until very cold, at least 6 hours.
Freeze custard in ice cream maker, then transfer to an airtight container and put in freezer to firm up, about 2 hours.

Preheat oven to 350&;amp;deg;F. Grease 9x13x2-inch cake pan. Combine caramels, butter and milk in heavy medium saucepan. Stir over medium-low heat until caramels melt and mixture is smooth, about 6 minutes.
Prepare cake mix according to package directions. Pour half of batter into prepared pan. Bake until top appears dry and cake is almost done, about 15 minutes. Pour caramel mixture evenly over cake. Sprinkle 1 cup pecans and chocolate chips over caramel. Pour remaining batter over filling. Sprinkle with remaining pecans. Bake until toothpick inserted into top half of cake comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool cake completely.

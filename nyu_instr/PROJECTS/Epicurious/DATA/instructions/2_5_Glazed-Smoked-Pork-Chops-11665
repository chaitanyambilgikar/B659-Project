To make the pork chops: Preheat oven to 350°F.
In a small saucepan melt jelly with vinegar over moderate heat, stirring, and in a roasting pan brush pork all over with jelly. Cover pork with foil and roast in oven 1 hour. Remove foil and brush pork with pan juices. Reduce temperature to 325°F. and roast pork, uncovered, 15 minutes more. Let pork stand 15 minutes.
Serve pork, cut into chops, with mustard sauce.
To make the sauce: In a bowl whisk together mustard, sugar, and vinegar until sugar is dissolved and whisk in oil until sauce is emulsified. Whisk in water to thin sauce to the desired consistency. Sauce may be made 1 day in advance and kept covered and chilled. Serve sauce at room temperature. Makes 1 1/2 cups.

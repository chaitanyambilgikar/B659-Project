Smash olives with flat side of a large knife, then discard pits and chop olives. Toss potatoes with olives, oil, zest, cumin, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a 10-inch heavy skillet, then add water and bring to a boil.
Cover skillet and boil over medium heat until potatoes are tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove lid and cook, stirring, until water is evaporated, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve sprinkled with parsley.

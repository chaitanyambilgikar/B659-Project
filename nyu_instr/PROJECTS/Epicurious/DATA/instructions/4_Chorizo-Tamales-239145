1. Soak 24 of the husks in warm water for 1 hour. Tear 2 husks lengthwise into 24 (1/2-inch-wide) strings.
2. Toss the frozen corn with the oil and 1 teaspoon of the salt, then spread it over a cookie sheet.
3. Roast in a 400°F oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes.
4. Puree the chilies with the adobo sauce. In a small bowl, combine the chorizo and chili puree.
5. In a large bowl, combine the cornmeal, baking powder, and the remaining salt. Add the shortening, chorizo mixture, and corn. Stir in the stock gradually until the mixture has the consistency of mashed potatoes.
6. Spoon 1/4 cup of the filling into the center of each husk. Roll to form a cylinder, fold the ends over, and tie with the husk strings.
7. Line a steamer with some of the remaining husks, add the tamales, and cover with more husks and the lid. Steam until tender, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.

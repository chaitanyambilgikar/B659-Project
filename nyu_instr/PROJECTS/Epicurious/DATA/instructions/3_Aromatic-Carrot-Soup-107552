1. Melt the butter with the oil in a large saucepan over low heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring, until wilted, about 15 minutes. Sprinkle with ginger and mace; cook, stirring, for 1 minute.
2. Add the carrots, broth, and orange zest. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer, partially covered, about 20 minutes. Cool slightly.
3. Puree in batches in a food processor. Return to the pot; stir in orange juice, salt, and pepper. Heat over low heat. Garnish with chives.

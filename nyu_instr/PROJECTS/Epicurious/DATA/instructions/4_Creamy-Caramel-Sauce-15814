In a heavy saucepan simmer sugar, water, corn syrup, and a pinch salt, stirring, until sugar is dissolved. Boil mixture, without stirring, until a golden caramel. Remove pan from heat and add cream and vanilla, stirring until combined well, about 1 minute. Cool sauce to room temperature (sauce will thicken as it cools). Sauce keeps, covered and chilled, 3 weeks. Bring sauce to room temperature before serving.

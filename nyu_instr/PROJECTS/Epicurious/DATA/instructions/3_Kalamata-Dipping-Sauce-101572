In a bowl with an electric mixer or a whisk beat together the egg yolks, the vinegar, the mustard, and the salt, add 1/2 cup of the oil, drop by drop, beating, and add the remaining 1 cup oil in a stream, beating until the mixture is emulsified. Stir in the olives, the lemon juice, the sour cream, and pepper to taste and chill the dipping sauce, covered, for at least 1 hour or overnight.

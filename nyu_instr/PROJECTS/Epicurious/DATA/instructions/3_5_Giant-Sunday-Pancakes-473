Preheat oven to 250°F. Whisk eggs, sugar and melted butter in medium bowl until blended. Add flour alternately with milk in 3 additions, whisking to blend after each addition. Whisk in baking powder and salt.
Melt enough butter in heavy medium nonstick skillet over medium heat just to coat bottom. Ladle scant 3/4 cup batter into skillet, rotating skillet to spread batter to about 6-inch-diameter round. Cook pancake until bubbles form on surface and bottom is brown, about 1 minute. Turn over pancake and cook until bottom is brown and pancake is cooked through, about 1 minute. Transfer to large baking sheet. Place in oven to keep warm. Repeat with remaining batter to form 5 more pancakes, adding more butter to skillet as necessary. Serve with syrup.

1. Combine 4 cups whole milk, 1 cup cream, 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, and 2 tablespoons lemon juice in a saucepan and bring just to a boil without stirring. Immediately remove pan from heat.
2. Let mixture stand for 15 minutes at room temperature. As time passes, the curds will begin to separate from the whey. If only a few curds form, your lemons may not be acidic enough; add another 1 tablespoon lemon juice, gently stir so you don't break up the curds too much, and let stand for 5 minutes more.
3. Using a large spoon (not slotted) or measuring cup, spoon curds into a cheeseclothlined sieve set over a large bowl. The longer you drain the ricotta, the denser and more flavorful the cheese will be. Add it to your favorite lasagna, or spread some on toast and drizzle it with honey for breakfast.

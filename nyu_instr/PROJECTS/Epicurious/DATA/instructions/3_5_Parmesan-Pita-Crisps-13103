Preheat oven to 375°F.
Split each pita loaf horizontally into 2 rounds and brush rough sides with oil. Cut each round into 16 wedges and arrange with edges touching, oiled sides up, on 2 baking sheets. Sprinkle pita with Parmesan and salt and pepper to taste and bake on middle and lower racks of oven, switching position of sheets in oven halfway through baking, 12 to 15 minutes, or until golden. Crisps may be made 3 days ahead and kept in an airtight container at room temperature.

Place finely chopped bittersweet chocolate in large bowl. Bring heavy whipping cream, whole milk, and smoked tea to simmer in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat. Turn off heat; add 1/4 cup sugar and stir to dissolve. Steep tea uncovered 5 minutes.
Whisk egg yolks and remaining 1/4 cup sugar in medium bowl to blend. Gradually whisk hot cream mixture into yolk mixture, then strain over chocolate. Let stand 2 minutes. Whisk until chocolate is melted and custard is smooth. Cover and chill custard overnight.
Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 300°F. Divide custard among eight 3/4-cup ramekins or custard cups. Cover each ramekin with plastic wrap and arrange ramekins in large roasting pan. Carefully add enough warm water to roasting pan to come halfway up sides of ramekins.
Bake custards in water bath until just set in center, about 55 minutes. Remove ramekins from water. Uncover and refrigerate until cold, at least 6 hours. DO AHEAD: Custards can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and keep refrigerated.
For topping: Combine cream and sugar in medium bowl. Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; whisk until peaks form. Dollop cream atop custards and serve.

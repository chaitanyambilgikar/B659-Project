In a bowl stir together the butter, the brown sugar, the ginger, the pecans, and the raisins. Core the apples, peel the top third of them, and rub the peeled flesh with the lemon. Spoon the ginger mixture into the apple cavities, mounding it, arrange the apples in a deep microwave-safe dish, and microwave them, covered, at high power (100%), rotating the dish halfway through the cooking, for 8 minutes. Transfer the apples to 2 plates, spoon the cooking liquid over them, and serve the apples with the ice cream.

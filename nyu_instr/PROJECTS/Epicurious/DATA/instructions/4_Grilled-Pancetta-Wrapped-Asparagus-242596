Prepare a grill for direct-heat cooking over medium-hot charcoal (medium-high heat for gas).
Trim asparagus to 6 inches long, then toss with oil and 1/4 tsp pepper in a small dish. Wrap middle of each asparagus with 1 slice of pancetta. Thread 3 or 4 wrapped asparagus 1/2 inch apart onto each skewer.
Oil grill rack, then grill asparagus, uncovered, turning, until pancetta is golden brown in spots and asparagus is crisp-tender, about 6 minutes.

Place sun-dried tomatoes in food processor. Boil white wine, white wine vinegar, black peppercorns and bay leaf in heavy small saucepan until liquid is reduced to 3 tablespoons, about 8 minutes. Strain liquid into tomatoes in processor and puree until smooth. Return tomato mixture to same saucepan. Add whipping cream, chicken stock and thyme. Simmer until flavors blend, about 3 minutes. Season to taste with salt.

In a sterilized 1-quart Mason-type jar (procedure follows) decoratively arrange carrots and zucchini standing up.
In a saucepan bring remaining ingredients to a boil and simmer, stirring occasionally, 3 minutes, or until sugar is dissolved. Pour hot pickling mixture over vegetables and arrange tarragon sprigs on top. Cool pickled vegetables completely. Wipe rim of jar with a dampened cloth and seal jar with lid. Chill pickled vegetables at least overnight to develop flavor. Pickled vegetables keep, covered and chilled, 1 month.
To Sterilize Jars And Glasses For Pickling: Wash jars in hot suds and rinse in scalding water. Put jars and lids in a kettle and cover with hot water. Bring water to a boil, covered, and boil jars 15 minutes from time that steam emerges from kettle. Turn off heat and let jars stand in hot water. Just before they are filled invert jars onto a kitchen towel to dry. (Jars should be filled while still hot.)

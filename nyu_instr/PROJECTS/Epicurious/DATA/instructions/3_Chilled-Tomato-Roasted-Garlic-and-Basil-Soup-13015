In a small heavy skillet dry-roast garlic over moderately low heat, turning it occasionally, until skin is browned and garlic is tender, about 20 minutes, and peel. In a blender purée garlic and tomatoes in batches and force through a fine sieve into a bowl. Stir in vinegar, Tabasco, and salt to taste. Chill soup, covered, at least until cold, about 6 hours, and up to 1 day. Before serving, stir in basil and season with salt and pepper if necessary.

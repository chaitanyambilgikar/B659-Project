Cook potatoes in pot of boiling salted water until tender, about 30 minutes. Drain. Cool slightly. Peel, halve, and thinly slice potatoes.
Whisk eggs, 1/3 cup chives, salt, and pepper in bowl. Cook bacon in 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until crisp. Using slotted spoon, transfer to paper towels. Reserve 1 tablespoon drippings in skillet; pour remainder into cup. Return skillet to medium heat. Add half of egg mixture; stir with back of fork until edges begin to set. Cook without stirring until omelet is set, lifting edges with spatula to let uncooked egg flow underneath, about 2 minutes. Spoon half of potatoes and bacon down center of omelet. Fold both sides of omelet over filling; slide out onto plate. Repeat with remaining egg mixture, potatoes, and bacon, adding more bacon drippings or butter to skillet if necessary. Garnish omelets with 1 tablespoon chives.

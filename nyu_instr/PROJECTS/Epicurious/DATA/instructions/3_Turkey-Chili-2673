Melt butter in heavy large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and celery and sauté until vegetables begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Add chicken broth, tomatoes, water, tomato sauce, chili seasoning mix with masa flour and 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of red chili pepper or cayenne pepper packet. Stir until well blended. Mix in beans and corn. Bring mixture just to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer chili until thickened, stirring frequently, about 30 minutes. Add turkey and simmer until heated through, about 3 minutes. Season with salt, pepper and additional red chili pepper, if desired.

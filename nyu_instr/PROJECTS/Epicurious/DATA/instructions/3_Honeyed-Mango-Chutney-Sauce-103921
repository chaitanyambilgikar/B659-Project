Heat oil in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add next 4 ingredients and sauté until onion is soft, about 3 minutes. Add stock, honey, vinegar and ginger. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until thick sauce forms, stirring occasionally, about 1 hour 40 minutes. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cool, then cover and refrigerate. Before continuing, bring to simmer.) Stir cilantro into sauce. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

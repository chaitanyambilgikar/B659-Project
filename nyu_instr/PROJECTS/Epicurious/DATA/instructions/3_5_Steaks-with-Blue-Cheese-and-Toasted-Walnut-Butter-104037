Mix butter and cheese in medium bowl to blend; stir in walnuts. Season mixture with salt and pepper. Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle steaks with salt and pepper. Add steaks to skillet and sauté until brown and cooked to desired doneness, about 4 minutes per side for medium-rare. Transfer steaks to plates. Top each with generous tablespoonful of blue cheese-walnut butter and serve.

Discard 1 or 2 outer leaves of lemongrass and trim root ends. Finely chop enough lemongrass from lower 6 inches of stalks to measure 1/4 cup total.
In a small saucepan combine lemongrass and 1 cup tomato water and simmer, uncovered, 10 minutes. Pour mixture through a fine sieve into another small saucepan, discarding solids, and stir in gelatin. Heat mixture over low heat, stirring, until gelatin is dissolved. In a large bowl stir gelatin mixture into remaining 5 cups tomato water. Chill tomato-water mixture, covered, at least 8 hours and up to 1 day. Discard rind and seeds from watermelon and finely chop enough fruit to measure 3/4 cup.
Divide soup among 6 bowls and just before serving add watermelon, chives, and mint.

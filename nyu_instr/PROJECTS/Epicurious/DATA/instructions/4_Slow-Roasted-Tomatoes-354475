Preheat oven to 200°F with racks in upper and lower thirds.
Put tomatoes, cut side up, in 2 large 4-sided sheet pans. Combine garlic and oil and spoon over tomatoes. Season tomatoes with salt and pepper and roast in oven 6 to 8 hours (tomatoes will be greatly reduced in size but still moist). Cool.

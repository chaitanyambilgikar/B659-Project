Make the ponzu sauce: Place the stock, soy sauce, and sugar in a small saucepan and heat slowly until small bubbles appear around the rim. Stir to dissolve the sugar. Remove the saucepan from the heat and add the bonito flakes. Wait 2 minutes, then add the lemon and/or lime juice. Strain the mixture through a fine-woven muslin cloth- or coffee filter-lined colander. Chill the sauce for at least 20 minutes, or refrigerate up to several days.
Assemble the salad: If the cooked noodles seem sticky or pasty, quickly rinse in cold water and drain well. Divide them among 4 shallow serving bowls. Garnish the noodles with sesame seeds and chives or scallions. Serve the chilled ponzu sauce on the side to drizzle on and toss in just before eating.

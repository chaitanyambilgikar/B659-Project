Preheat the oven to 350°F. Cut the eggs in half lengthwise. Remove the yolks and set the whites aside. Stir together the yolks, ham, 1/4 teaspoon of the salt, pepper, mustard, and celery seed. Stir in 1 to 3 tablespoons of the cream, just enough to make the filling smooth yet remain fairly stiff. Spoon the filling into the whites. Arrange the filled eggs in a single layer in a small gratin dish or shallow baking dish.
Have ready a small bowl of ice water. Place the sweetbreads in a small saucepan and cover them with cold water. Stir in the remaining 1 teaspoon of salt. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer until the sweetbreads are plump and feel slightly firmer to the touch, about 3 minutes. Transfer the sweetbreads with a slotted spoon to the bowl of ice water and set aside until cool enough to handle. Discard all but 1 cup of the cooking liquid to use as stock. Drain the sweetbreads. Cut away any fat and pull away as much of the membranes and connective tissue as possible without breaking them up. Cut the sweetbreads into thumb-sized pieces. Place in a bowl, add 1 cup of cream, and set aside.
Melt the butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in the morels and cook, stir- ring often, until tender and lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Whisk the flour into the reserved sweetbread stock until smooth, then slowly stir into the morels. Cook until the sauce slightly thickens, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat. Stir in the sweet- breads, cream, and 4 tablespoons of the bourbon. Taste, then add the rest of the bour-bon if you like the kick. Season with salt and pepper.
Pour the sweetbread mixture over the eggs. Sprinkle with the Parmesan, Cheddar, and almonds. Bake until the cheese is browned and bubbly, about 10 to 15 minutes. If the cheese isn't browned after 15 minutes, run the dish under a broiler for a few seconds. Serve piping hot.

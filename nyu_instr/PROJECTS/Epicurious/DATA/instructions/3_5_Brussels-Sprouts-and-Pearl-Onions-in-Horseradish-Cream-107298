Cook onions in large pot of boiling salted water until tender, about 5 minutes. Using large strainer, transfer onions to bowl; set aside to cool. Return water to boil; add more salt. Add brussels sprouts and boil until just tender, about 6 minutes. Drain well; cool. Peel onions, leaving core intact. Cut brussels sprouts in half through root end. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Combine vegetables in medium bowl; cover and chill.)
Whisk 3 tablespoons horseradish, flour, and allspice in small bowl to blend; whisk in whipping cream. Melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add chopped thyme and stir 30 seconds. Add vegetables and sauté until heated through, about 4 minutes. Add cream mixture and cook until vegetables are coated and cream mixture is reduced to glaze, stirring often, about 3 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper, adding more horseradish by 1/4 teaspoonfuls, if desired. Transfer vegetables to bowl. Garnish with thyme sprigs, if desired.

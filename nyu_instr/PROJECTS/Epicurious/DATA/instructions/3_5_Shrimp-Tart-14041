Make crust: Preheat oven to 350° F. and lightly oil rim of a 12-inch tart pan with removable fluted rim.
Tear pumpernickel into pieces and in a food processor pulse until coarse crumbs. In a bowl stir together bread crumbs and butter until combined well and press onto bottom of tart pan. Bake crust in middle of oven 15 minutes, or until golden brown, and cool in pan on a rack.
Make filling: Shell shrimp and if desired devein. In a saucepan of boiling salted water cook shrimp until just cooked through, about 1 minute, and drain in a colander. Rinse shrimp under cold water and pat dry. Coarsely chop shrimp.
If using red lumpfish caviar, in a fine sieve rinse and drain well. In a large bowl stir together shrimp, caviar, sour cream, mayonnaise, and heavy cream. In a small saucepan sprinkle gelatin over lemon juice and water and let stand 1 minute to soften. Heat gelatin mixture over low heat, stirring, until gelatin is dissolved. Cool mixture slightly and stir into shrimp mixture with chives, white pepper, and salt to taste.
Pour filling into crust, spreading evenly. Chill tart, loosely covered with plastic wrap, at least 6 hours, or until filling is set, and up to 1 day. Garnish tart with chives.

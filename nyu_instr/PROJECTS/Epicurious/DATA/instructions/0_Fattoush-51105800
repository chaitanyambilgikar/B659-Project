1. Tear the bread into pieces (roughly 1-inch-square). Heat the vegetable oil over medium heat, and fry the bread bits until nicely browned and crisp, then set aside to drain on a plate lined with paper towels; or you can toast the pita instead of frying.
2. Combine vegetables, lettuce, parsley, and bread pieces in a large bowl, and toss well.
3. Whisk olive oil and lemon juice, and mix in garlic, sumac, mint, and salt and pepper to taste.
4. Pour dressing over salad and toss thoroughly.

Prepare grill.
Finely chop onion. In a bowl gently combine onion and turkey (do not overmix) and form into four 1/2-inch-thick patties. Center 1 tablespoon Boursin on each of 2 patties and top with remaining 2 patties, pressing edges together to seal. Season burgers with salt and pepper and grill on a lightly oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals 6 to 8 minutes on each side, or until just cooked through.
While burgers are grilling, brush bread with oil and toast on grill.
Serve burgers on bread with tomato and watercress.

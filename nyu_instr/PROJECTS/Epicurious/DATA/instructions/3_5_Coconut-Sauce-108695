Bring stock, coconut milk, and chicken to a boil in a 1 1/2- to 2-quart saucepan, then reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, 45 minutes.
Crush lemongrass stalk with side of a heavy knife (to release oils), then thinly slice. Add lemongrass, ginger, and chile to coconut mixture and bring to a boil. Remove pan from heat and let stand, covered, 30 minutes.
Pour sauce through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, discarding solids, then return to pan and bring to a boil. Season with salt. Blend sauce in a blender until frothy, about 30 seconds (use caution when blending hot liquids). Serve immediately.

Bring water with ham hock to a boil in an 8-quart pot, uncovered, skimming any froth, then reduce heat and simmer, covered, 1 hour.
While hock simmers, discard coarse stems and center ribs from collards, then wash leaves and drain. Coarsely chop collards.
Add collards and red pepper flakes to ham hock broth, then simmer, partially covered, stirring occasionally, until greens are very tender, about 45 minutes. Remove hock from cooking liquid and let stand until cool enough to handle, about 15 minutes. Discard skin and bones and coarsely chop meat. Stir meat and salt to taste into collards.

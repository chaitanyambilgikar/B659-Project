In a large mixing bowl, combine the milk, warm water, yeast, and sugar. Stir lightly, then let the mixture stand until creamy, about 5 minutes.
In a separate mixing bowl, whisk together the flours and salt. Using a wooden spoon, beat the flour mixture into the yeast mixture. Keep stirring until the batter is very elastic, about 5 minutes.
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the batter rise until doubled and bubbly, about 1 hour, 30 minutes.
Place the baking soda in a small bowl and add the hot water to dissolve it. Beat the baking soda into the batter, cover again, and let rise until bubbly, about 30 minutes.
Generously grease the inside of 6 English-muffin rings. Heat a nonstick griddle over medium heat, and place the rings (or as many as will fit) on the griddle. Stir down the batter, and ladle it into the rings, only 1/2 inch full. Be careful not to add too much batter, or the crumpet will be too thick and won't cook all the way through. Cook until the bottom is firmly set, the top starts to dry, and small holes begin to form on the surface, about 7 minutes. Slip off the muffin rings (they may be hot, so use pot holders), flip the crumpets with a spatula, and cook the other side until firm, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a cooling rack and cool completely before toasting. Repeat with the remaining batter.

In a 9-inch-square microwave-safe baking dish combine the cabbage, the carrot, 2 teaspoons of the salt, and 4 cups water, cover the mixture with microwave-safe plastic wrap, leaving one corner uncovered, and microwave it at high power (100%) for 5 minutes. Drain the vegetables and transfer them to a bowl of ice and cold water to stop the cooking. Drain the vegetables, pat them dry between several thicknesses of paper towels, and transfer them to a bowl. In a small bowl stir together the vinegar, the remaining 1 teaspoon salt, and the sugar until the sugar is dissolved, pour the liquid over the vegetables, and chill the mixture, stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes. Serve the pickled vegetables with fried chicken or grilled meats.

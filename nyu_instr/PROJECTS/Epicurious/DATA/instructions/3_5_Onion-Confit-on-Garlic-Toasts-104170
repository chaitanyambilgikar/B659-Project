1. Preheat oven to 325° F. On a large baking sheet arrange bread slices in one layer and lightly brush both sides of each slice with about 2 tablespoons olive oil. Toast slices in middle of oven 15 minutes and turn over. Toast an additional 15 minutes, or until golden. Transfer toasts to a rack and rub one side of each toast with cut side of halved garlic. Let cool. Toasts may be made 2 days ahead and kept in a sealable plastic bag at room temperature.
2. Heat the butter and remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onions and sugar. Season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are soft, 15 to 20 minutes.
3. Increase heat to medium-high. Add red wine and cook, stirring occasionally, until wine is reduced and onions are deep golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes more. Add thyme; taste and adjust for seasoning. Transfer onions to a bowl and serve immediately with toasts.

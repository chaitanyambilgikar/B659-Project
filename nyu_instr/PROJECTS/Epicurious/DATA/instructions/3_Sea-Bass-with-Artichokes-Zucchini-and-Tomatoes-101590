Preheat oven to 475°F. Drain marinade from artichokes into 9-inch-diameter glass pie dish. Add fish; turn to coat with marinade. Sprinkle fish with salt and pepper. Scatter artichokes, tomatoes, zucchini, basil and garlic around fish. Pour clam juice over. Bake until fish is just opaque in center, about 20 minutes.

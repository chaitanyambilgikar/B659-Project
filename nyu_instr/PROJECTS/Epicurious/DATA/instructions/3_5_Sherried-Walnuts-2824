Line 2 cookie sheets with waxed paper. Combine first 5 ingredients in heavy large saucepan. Stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Cook without stirring until clip-on candy thermometer registers 240°F., about 10 minutes. Remove from heat. Add nuts and stir until syrup begins to look cloudy, about 2 minutes. Divide mixture between cookie sheets. Working quickly, separate nuts with fork. Cool. (Can be made 1 week ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.)

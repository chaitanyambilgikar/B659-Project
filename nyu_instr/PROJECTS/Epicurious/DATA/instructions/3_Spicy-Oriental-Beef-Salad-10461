In a large skillet heat the oil over moderately high heat until it is hot but not smoking, in it stir-fry the beef for 1 minute, or just until it is no longer pink, and drain the beef in a sieve. In a bowl whisk together the Worcestershire sauce, the lime juice, the cayenne, the sugar, the soy sauce, and the garlic paste, add the beef, and stir it to combine it well with the dressing. Stir in the scallion and the coriander, divide the mixture between 2 plates, lined with the lettuce leaves, and garnish the salads with lime wedges.

Make the beans: Soak the beans overnight. In the morning, pick out any bad ones and any stones. Wash the beans and place them in a large pot filled with water. Place the garlic, coriander seeds, and bay leaf in a cheesecloth bag or tea ball and add to the beans in the water. Bring the water to a boil, reduce the heat to a simmer, and cook the beans 1 hour, until tender. Discard the spices. Drain the beans well and set aside while you make the chili. Add the salt.
Make the chili: Place the chiles in a large heatproof bowl and cover with boiling water. Let stand 30 minutes, until soft; then seed and stem them. In a food processor or blender, puree the chiles with 1 cup water until smooth. Set aside.
In a large skillet, brown the bell pepper, onions, and garlic in 2 tablespoons of the oil until they are soft. Set aside.
In a large Dutch oven, brown the venison and sausage in the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil. Drain the excess fat. Add the bell pepper mixture along with the salt, pepper, oregano, cumin, sugar, and 3 cups water. Add the tomatoes, smashing each in the palm of your hand before adding it to the pot. Add the chile puree, stir and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and cook, partially covered, at a low boil for 1 1/2 hours. Remove from the heat. Add the masa harina mixture, stirring to thicken the chili. Return the chili to the heat and cook 7 more minutes.
Serve in deep bowls atop a bed of snowcap beans.

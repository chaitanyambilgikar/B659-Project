Preheat oven to 400°F. and butter twelve 1/3-cup muffin cups.
Into a bowl sift together flour, ginger, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In a small bowl whisk together egg and molasses until combined. Coarsely chop dates. In a large bowl with an electric mixer beat together butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in flour and egg mixtures until just combined and stir in dates. Divide batter among muffin cups and bake in middle of oven until a tester comes out clean, about 15 minutes (muffins will not dome).

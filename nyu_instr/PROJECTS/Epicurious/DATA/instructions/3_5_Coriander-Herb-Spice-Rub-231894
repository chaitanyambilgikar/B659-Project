Toast coriander seeds in a heavy small skillet over medium heat until aromatic, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a mortar or spice mill. Add peppercorns and crush until broken into coarse pieces. Mix crushed spices in a small bowl with thyme, rosemary, and salt. Store in the refrigerator in an airtight container for up to 3 days.

Combine the corn syrup, sugar, vanilla, and 1/4 cup water in a saucepan and stir well. Cook over high heat, swirling the pan by its handle, until the mixture comes to a boil. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, or until the syrup reaches the soft-ball stage and the temperature registers 240°F on a candy thermometer.
While the syrup boils, place the egg whites in a grease-free mixing bowl and beat at medium speed with an electric mixer until frothy. Add cream of tartar and salt, increase the speed to high, and beat until stiff peaks form.
Pour the hot syrup into the meringue very slowly with the mixer set on medium speed, and continue beating several minutes until mixture holds its shape. Beat in the vanilla. Transfer the sauce to a container and refrigerate until cold.

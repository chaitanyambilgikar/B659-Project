Place rice in large strainer. Rinse under cold running water until water runs off clear. Let rice drain thoroughly.
Bring broth, lime juice and salt to boil in small saucepan. Cover; keep warm. Melt butter in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat. Add rice; stir until butter starts to brown, about 3 minutes. Mix broth mixture into rice. Reduce heat to low. Cover and cook until broth is absorbed and rice is tender, about 20 minutes.
Butter six 3/4-cup ramekins or custard cups. Divide rice among prepared ramekins, packing gently. (Can be made 2 hours ahead. Cool; cover with plastic. Let stand at room temperature. Rewarm, covered, in microwave on low 2 minutes.) Unmold rice onto plates.

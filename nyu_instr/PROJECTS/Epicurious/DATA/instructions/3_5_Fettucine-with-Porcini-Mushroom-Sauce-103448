Melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add shallots and sauté until beginning to brown, about 4 minutes. Add mushrooms and stir to coat. Add broth and cream and bring sauce to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover and simmer until mushrooms are tender, about 20 minutes. Uncover and boil until sauce thickens slightly, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Season sauce with salt and pepper.
Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally. Drain, reserving 1/2 cup cooking water. Return pasta to pot. Add sauce; toss over medium-low heat until heated through, adding reserved cooking water by tablespoonfuls if pasta is dry. Season with salt and pepper. Serve, passing cheese separately.

Heat a cooker to 230° to 250°F.
Remove the ribs from the refrigerator and rub them all over with the olive oil. Sprinkle with the granulated garlic, then season with the lemon pepper and rosemary.
Oil the grate and place the ribs on it bone side down over indirect heat. Cover and cook for 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours, turning every 45 minutes, until the ribs are pull-apart tender.
Transfer the ribs to a cutting board and let them rest, covered loosely with aluminum foil, for 10 to 15 minutes. Cut the ribs into individual pieces and serve.

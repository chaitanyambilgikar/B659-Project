Stir lemon juice and wasabi powder in medium bowl to blend. Mix in salmon, cucumber, cilantro, green onion, sesame seeds, ginger and sesame oil. Shape all of salmon mixture into 1 1/2-inch-thick patty, about 3 1/2 inches in diameter. Moisten ends of nori strips. Wrap nori strips snugly around sides of patty, pressing ends together to seal. Place salmon tartare on platter. (Can be made 4 hours ahead. Cover; refrigerate.) Surround with crackers.

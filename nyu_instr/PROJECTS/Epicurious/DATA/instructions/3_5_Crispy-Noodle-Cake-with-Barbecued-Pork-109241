Blanch bean sprouts in large pot of boiling salted water 10 seconds. Using large slotted skimmer or sieve, transfer sprouts to colander. Rinse under cold water to cool quickly. Add noodles to same pot of boiling water and cook until just tender but still firm to bite, about 5 minutes. Drain well; rinse with cold water and drain again, tossing to release as much water as possible.
Heat 1 tablespoon peanut oil in heavy large wok or skillet over medium-high heat. Add ginger, garlic, and minced green onions. Sauté 1 minute. Add carrots, snow peas, and pork. Stir-fry until carrots are just crisp-tender, about 2 minutes. Mix in bean sprouts, noodles, and green onion tops. Stir-fry 1 minute. Stir cornstarch mixture to reblend and add to wok. Cook until sauce thickens, stirring often, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer noodle mixture to large bowl and cool. (Can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.)
Heat 2 tablespoons peanut oil in heavy large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add noodle mixture. Cook until bottom of noodle cake is brown and crusty, occasionally pressing to compact and shaking pan to prevent sticking, about 5 minutes. Turn cake out onto rimless baking sheet, browned side up. Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil to skillet and heat. Slide noodle cake back into skillet, browned side up. Cook until bottom is brown and crusty, about 6 minutes. Slide noodle cake out onto platter. Cut into wedges and serve.
*Thin, spaghetti-like noodles, available at Asian markets and in the Asian foods section of many supermarkets.

Preheat oven to 400°F.
Cut off wing tips, reserving them for another use, and halve wings at joint. Arrange wings, skin sides down, in a roasting pan large enough to hold them in one layer.
In a small saucepan heat remaining ingredients over moderately low heat, stirring, until sugar is dissolved and pour evenly over wings. Bake wings in middle of oven 45 minutes. Turn wings over and bake until cooking liquid is thick and sticky, about 45 minutes to 1 hour more.
Transfer wings with tongs to a platter.

Preheat oven to 400°F. Mix cherries, 1/4 cup flour, 3/4 cup sugar, 2 teaspoons orange peel and lemon juice in large bowl. Transfer mixture to 8-inch square glass baking dish.
Combine 1 1/2 cups flour, 2 tablespoons sugar, 1 teaspoon peel, butter, egg, orange juice and salt in processor. Using on/off turns, process until clumps form. Turn out onto floured surface to 11-inch square. Place atop filling. Fold edges over, forming double thick edge. Crimp edge. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon sugar. Cut vents in crust to allow steam to escape.
Bake until juices bubble and crust is golden, about 50 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.

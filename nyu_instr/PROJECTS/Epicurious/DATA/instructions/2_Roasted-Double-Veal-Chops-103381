Cook pancetta and chops: Preheat oven to 400°F.
Cook pancetta in 1 tablespoon oil over moderately low heat in a large heavy skillet, stirring occasionally, until browned and fat is rendered. Transfer pancetta to paper towels to drain, reserving fat in skillet.
3Pat chops dry and season with salt and pepper. Increase heat under skillet to moderately high, then brown chops in fat on all sides, adding more oil if necessary. Transfer chops to a small flameproof roasting pan, bone sides down, and set skillet aside.
Roast chops in middle of oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted 2 inches into center of meat (without touching bone) registers 135°F for medium, about 1 hour. Transfer chops to a cutting board and let stand, covered loosely with foil, 15 minutes (internal temperature will rise to about 140°F).
Begin sauce while chops are roasting: Discard all but about 1 tablespoon fat from skillet. Heat over moderate heat until hot but not smoking, then cook garlic, stirring, until fragrant, 30 seconds. Add wine to skillet and deglaze by boiling over high heat, scraping up brown bits. Add stock and boil until mixture is reduced to about 3/4 cup.
Finish sauce while chops are standing:
Deglaze roasting pan with wine mixture. Transfer to a small saucepan and skim off any fat. Reheat and swirl in butter, parsley, and thyme. Stir in any juices accumulated on cutting board, pancetta, and pepper to taste.
With chops on their sides, cut parallel to bones into thin slices, then serve with sauce.

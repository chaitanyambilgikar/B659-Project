Sprinkle gelatin over water in a large bowl and let soften 1 minute.
Bring 1 cup juice just to a boil and add to gelatin mixture. Add sugar and a pinch of salt, stirring until sugar and gelatin are dissolved. Stir in remaining 3 cups juice. Pour mixture into mold and chill, uncovered, until set, about 8 hours.
To unmold, dip mold into a bowl of hot water for just a few seconds. Shake mold from side to side, then invert onto a serving plate.

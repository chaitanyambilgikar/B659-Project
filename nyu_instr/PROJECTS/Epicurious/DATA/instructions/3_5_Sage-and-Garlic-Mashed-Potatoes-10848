In a small saucepan simmer garlic in oil until golden. Stir in sage and remove pan from heat. Let mixture stand 15 minutes and drain oil through a fine sieve into a small bowl, discarding solids.
Make fried sage leaves: In a small skillet heat 1/8 inch oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and fry sage leaves, 1 at a time, about 3 seconds, until crisp, transferring with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain. Sprinkle sage leaves with coarse salt.
Peel potatoes and quarter. In a large saucepan cover potatoes by 1 inch with salted cold water and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Reserve about 1/3 cup cooking liquid and drain potatoes.
Preheat oven to 350°F.
While potatoes are still warm force through a ricer or medium disk of a food mill into a bowl and beat in yogurt, butter, seasoned oil, enough reserved liquid to reach desired consistency, and salt and pepper to taste. Transfer to an ovenproof serving dish. Mashed potatoes may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.
Heat potatoes in oven until heated through and top with fried sage leaves.

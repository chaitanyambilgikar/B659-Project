In a food processor purée cranberries and transfer to a small bowl.
In a dry heavy saucepan cook sugar over moderate heat, stirring with a fork, until melted and cook, without stirring, swirling pan, until a golden caramel. Remove pan from heat and carefully add water and cranberry purée (caramel will steam and harden). Return pan to heat and simmer sauce, stirring, 10 minutes, or until caramel is dissolved. Pour sauce through a fine sieve into a heatproof bowl, pressing hard on solids, and cool completely. Sauce may be made 4 days ahead and chilled, covered. Bring sauce to room temperature before serving.

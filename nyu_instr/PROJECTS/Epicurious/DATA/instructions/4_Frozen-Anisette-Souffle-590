Cook sugar and water in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat, stirring until sugar dissolves. Boil without stirring until candy thermometer registers 240°F, about 12 minutes.
Meanwhile, with electric mixer beat egg whites in large bowl until stiff but not dry. Beat hot syrup into egg whites in slow steady stream. Mix in 3 tablespoons anisette. Continue beating until mixture is stiff and shiny. Whip cream and remaining 3 tablespoons anisette in medium bowl until peaks form. Fold into whites. Transfer to 8-cup soufflé dish or eight 1-cup ramekins. Cover and freeze until firm, about 8 hours. (Can be prepared 2 days ahead.) Garnish with fruit if desired.

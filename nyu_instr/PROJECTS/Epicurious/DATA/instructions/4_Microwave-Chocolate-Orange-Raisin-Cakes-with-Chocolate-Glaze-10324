Make the cake: Line the bottoms of two 1-cup microwave-safe ramekins with wax paper and fasten a wax paper collar 2 inches high around each ramekin. In a microwave-safe measuring cup stir together the raisins and the Grand Marnier and microwave the mixture at high power (100%) for 1 minute. In a bowl whisk together the brown sugar and the oil and whisk in the egg, the milk, the flour, the cocoa powder, the cinnamon, the baking soda, and the salt. Stir in the raisin mixture, combine the batter well, and divide it between the ramekins. Microwave the cakes at medium power (50%) for 2 minutes. Let the cakes stand on a rack for 5 minutes. Run a thin knife around the edges of the ramekins, invert the cakes onto the rack, removing the wax paper carefully, and let them cool slightly.
Make the glaze: In a 1-pint microwave-safe glass measure combine the cream, the butter, the chocolate, and a pinch of salt, microwave the mixture at high power (100%) for 1 minute, or until the cream comes to a boil, and stir it until it is smooth.
Set the rack with the cakes over a baking sheet and pour the glaze over the cakes, spreading it as necessary to coat the tops and sides.

Mix together salmon, pita, mayonnaise, egg, coriander, cayenne, 1 tablespoon chives, 1 teaspoon zest, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Season with black pepper and form into 4 cakes (4 inches in diameter).
Heat oil in a 12-inch heavy nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Cook salmon cakes, turning over once, until golden and just cooked through, 6 to 7 minutes total.
Stir together yogurt, lemon juice, 1/4 teaspoon salt, remaining tablespoon chives, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon zest. Serve salmon cakes with sauce.
Serve with: Moroccan eggplant salad; sliced tomatoes drizzled with fruity olive oil; or celery and potato salad (serve in place of the yogurt sauce)

Rest the melon on a rimmed tray or platter, then score diagonal gashes several inches apart all around the melon, cutting through the rind into the "meat." Take a sharp knife and cut out a conical plug from the top center. This cone should be about two inches in diameter and about six inches long when it is withdrawn from the melon. Place the tray with the melon in your refrigerator for at least an hour, maybe longer. Moisture will seep out during this process through the side gashes and will rise in the hole left by the cone. Pour off this liquid out of the cone and fill the hole slowly with straight bourbon. Return the melon on its tray to the refrigerator, chill thoroughly, and keep adding bourbon periodically. Serve the melon sliced, or as a coconut-garnished melon ball dessert.
Kentucky Watermelon should be popular as a de luxe picnic treat, too. Just pack the whole melon in ice until you're ready to serve.

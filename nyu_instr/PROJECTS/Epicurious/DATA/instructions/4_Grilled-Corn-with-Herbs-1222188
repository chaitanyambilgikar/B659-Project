Prepare grill for cooking over medium-hot charcoal (moderate heat for gas).
Grill corn (in husks) on lightly oiled grill rack, turning, covered, until kernels are tender, 20 to 30 minutes. Remove corn from grill and let stand until cool enough to handle but still warm, about 10 minutes.
Discard husks and stem ends from corn. Cut kernels off cobs with a large knife and toss with herbs and lime butter sauce.

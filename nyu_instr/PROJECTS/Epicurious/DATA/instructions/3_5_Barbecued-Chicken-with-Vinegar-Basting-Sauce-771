Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat) or preheat broiler.
Whisk first 9 ingredients in small bowl to blend. Arrange chicken in shallow glass dish. Spoon 1/4 cup sauce over; turn to coat evenly. Let stand at least 10 minutes and up to 30 minutes, turning chicken occasionally.
Grill chicken until just cooked through, basting occasionally with another 1/4 cup sauce, about 5 minutes per side.
Serve with remaining sauce.

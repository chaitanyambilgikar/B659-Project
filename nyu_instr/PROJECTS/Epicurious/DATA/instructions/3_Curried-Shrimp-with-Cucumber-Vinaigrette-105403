Purée cucumber with vinegar in a blender until very smooth. Add sesame oil and blend until emulsified. Season with salt and pepper.
Pat shrimp dry and sprinkle with curry powder and salt and pepper to taste. Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then sauté shrimp in 2 batches, turning them, until golden brown and just cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes. (If necessary, add more vegetable oil to skillet for second batch.) Transfer shrimp to a plate to cool.
Serve shrimp at room temperature with vinaigrette for dipping.

Cover cashews with water in a 1 1/2- to 2-quart saucepan and simmer until slightly softened, about 4 minutes. Drain, then transfer to paper towels to dry, 40 to 50 minutes.
Stir together salt and cayenne.
Toss cashews with sugar in a bowl, then shake in a sieve to remove excess. Heat 1 1/2 inches oil in dried saucepan over moderate heat until it registers 375°F on thermometer. Fry cashews in 3 batches, stirring frequently, until deep golden brown and crisp, 2 to 3 minutes per batch. Transfer with a slotted spoon to a baking sheet as fried and sprinkle with some cayenne mixture. (Return oil to 375°F between batches.)

Make crust: Blend all ingredients in processor. Press crumb mixture onto bottom and up sides of 9-inch-diameter glass pie dish. Cover crust and freeze while preparing filling. (Can be made 1 week ahead. Keep frozen.)
Make filling: Preheat oven to 350°F. Combine butter, brown sugar and corn syrup in heavy medium saucepan. Bring to boil, stirring often. Boil 1 minute. Stir in nuts and cream. Boil until mixture thickens slightly, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat. Add chocolate. Stir until chocolate melts and mixture is well blended.
Pour hot filling into crust. Using spoon, evenly distribute nuts. Bake until filling bubbles all over, about 10 minutes. Transfer pie to rack and cool

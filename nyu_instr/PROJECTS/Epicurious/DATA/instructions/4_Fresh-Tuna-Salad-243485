1. Heat the oil in a large, nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Sear the tuna on the first side for 5 minutes, until lightly browned. Turn with a spatula and sear for 3 minutes longer or until cooked to your preference. Let the tuna rest for 5 minutes.
2. Flake the tuna into 1x1/2-inch pieces and remove to a large bowl. Toss gently with the celery, apple, and scallions. Season with salt.
3. Fold mayonnaise and basil into the tuna. Serve in radicchio cups with toasted peasant bread.

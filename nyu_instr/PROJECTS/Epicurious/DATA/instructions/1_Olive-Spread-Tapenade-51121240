1. In a medium bowl, soak the olives, capers, and anchovies in cold water for 5 minutes to remove excess salt. Rinse, drain, and pat dry.
2. In a food processor, combine the olives, capers, anchovies, mustard, lemon juice, Cognac (if using), parsley, and a pinch of black pepper. Blend until the ingredients are roughly chopped. With the machine running, slowly stream in the oil and continue processing until a coarse paste is formed.
3. Serve immediately or refrigerate for 1 hour to allow flavors to further develop.
Serving Suggestion: Serve the tapenade as an appetizer with croûtes (toast). To prepare, thinly slice a baguette and spread the slices in an even layer on a baking sheet. Brush the bread lightly with olive oil and bake at 325°F, turning as needed, until the bread is completely dry and lightly browned, about 30 minutes total. While still warm, rub the toasts with a clove of garlic. Serve warm or at room temperature.

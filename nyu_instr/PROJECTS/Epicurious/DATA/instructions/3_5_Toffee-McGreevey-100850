Preheat oven to 350°F. In a shallow baking pan spread almonds in one layer and toast in middle of oven until pale golden and fragrant, about 10 minutes. Cool nuts and finely chop 1/2 cup.
Lightly oil a 15 1/2 x 10 1/2 x 1-inch metal baking pan. Cut butter into 16 pieces and in a 2- to 3-quart heavy saucepan combine with sugar, corn syrup, and 2 tablespoons water. Bring mixture to a boil over moderately high heat, stirring until sugar is dissolved, and boil, stirring occasionally, until thermometer registers 290°F., about 7 minutes. Quickly stir in slivered almonds and immediately pour mixture into baking pan. With an offset or wooden spatula quickly spread toffee in an even layer as close to edges of pan as possible.
Let mixture stand 1 minute (it will still be very hot) and sprinkle evenly with chocolate chips. Let chips melt and with spatula spread chocolate evenly over toffee. Sprinkle chopped nuts evenly over chocolate, gently pressing them into it. Chill toffee until chocolate is firm, at least 2 hours, and up to 2 weeks, covering tightly after 2 hours. Break toffee into bite-size pieces and keep chilled to prevent chocolate from melting.

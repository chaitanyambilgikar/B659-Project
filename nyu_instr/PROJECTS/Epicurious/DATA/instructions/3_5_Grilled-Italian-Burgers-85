Mix first 4 ingredients in large bowl. Season with pepper. Divide mixture into quarters. Shape each into 3/4-inch-thick party. Mix tomatoes and mayonnaise in small bowl to blend. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover patties and tomato mayonnaise separately and chill.)
Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Grill burgers, onions and peppers until burgers are cooked through and onions and peppers are lightly charred, turning occasionally, about 10 minutes. Move peppers and onions to cool side of grill. Top burgers with cheese. Place rolls on grill cut side down. Cover with lid and cook until cheese melts and buns are heated through, about 2 minutes. Transfer buns to plates. Spread 3/4 tablespoon mayonnaise mixture over each bun half. Top with burger, then bell pepper and onion. Cover with top half of buns and serve.

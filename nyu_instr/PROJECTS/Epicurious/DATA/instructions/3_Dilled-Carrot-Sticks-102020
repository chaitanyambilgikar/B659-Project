Peel the carrots and cut into 2" long sticks. (Use a fancy cutter if you have one.) Cook in boiling water until crisp and almost tender and drain. Place 2 sprigs of dill on the bottom of each of 6 hot, sterilized pint-size preserving jars. Put 1 whole clove garlic in each jar. Place pickling spices and remaining dill on top. Heat salt, vinegar and water to boiling point. Fill each jar to overflowing, cover and seal. Keep in a cool place for at least 3 weeks before using.

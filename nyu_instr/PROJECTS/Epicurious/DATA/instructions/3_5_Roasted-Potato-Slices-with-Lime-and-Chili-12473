Preheat oven to 450°F.
Peel potatoes and halve lengthwise. Cut potatoes crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices and on a baking sheet toss with oil and salt and pepper to taste. Bake potatoes in one layer in middle of oven, stirring occasionally, 15 minutes, or until golden.
In a bowl stir together mayonnaise, lime juice, and chili powder. Add warm potatoes and combine well.

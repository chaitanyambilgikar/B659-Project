1. Place the shredded cucumbers in a medium bowl and toss with a few pinches of salt. Set aside for 15 minutes to draw some of the liquid out of the cucumbers.
2. Drain the excess liquid from the bowl of cucumbers. Add in the yogurt, vinegar, garlic, dried mint, and fresh mint. Mix well to combine. Adjust the seasoning as needed with salt and pepper. Refrigerate until ready to serve.

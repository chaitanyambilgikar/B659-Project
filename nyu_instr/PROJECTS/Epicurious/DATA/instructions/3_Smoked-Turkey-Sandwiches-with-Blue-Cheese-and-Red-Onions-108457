Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat) or preheat griddle pan over medium-high heat. Brush onion with olive oil. Grill until brown, about 2 minutes per side. Season with salt and pepper; cool.
Mix cheese, sour cream, and thyme in small bowl to blend. Season generously with pepper. Spread cheese mixture over 4 bread slices. Top cheese with grilled onions, radicchio, then turkey. Spread mustard on remaining 4 bread slices; place atop turkey. Press sandwiches lightly to compact. Cut sandwiches in half; wrap each tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate at least 2 hours and up to 1 day.

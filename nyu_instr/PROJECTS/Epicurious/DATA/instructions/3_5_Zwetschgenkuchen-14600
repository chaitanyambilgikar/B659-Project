To make the crust using a food processor, fitted with a metal blade, pulse the flour, salt, and 1 tablespoon of the sugar together. Cut the butter or margarine into small pieces, add to the bowl, and process until crumbly. Add the egg yolk and process until a ball is formed, adding more flour if necessary.
To make the dough by hand, use your fingers or a pastry blender to work the butter or margarine into the flour, salt, and 1 tablespoon sugar until the mixture resembles coarse breadcrumbs. Add the egg yolk and work the dough into a ball.
Remove the dough from the bowl, dust with flour, and pat into a flattened circle. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least a half hour. When you are ready to make the crust, dust your hands and the dough with flour. Place the dough in the center of a 9-inch pie plate and with your fingers gently pat in out to cover the bottom and go up the sides.
Preheat the oven to 400°F.
Prick the crust with the tines of a fork in several places and prebake the crust on the middle rack for 10 minutes. Remove the curst from the oven and let it cool slightly. Turn the oven down to 350°F.
Pit and cut the plums into fourths. Sprinkle the breadcrumbs on the dough, then spoon the apricot preserves on top and drizzle with the brandy. Place the plum quarters on the crust in a circle so that each overlaps the next and they eventually form a spiral into the center. Sprinkle with cinnamon and the remaining sugar. (At this point, if you wish, you can wrap and freeze the tart, to bake it later. Just remove the pie from the freezer one hour before baking.)
Place the tart in the oven and bake about 30 to 40 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the plums are juicy. Remove from the oven. Just before serving, sprinkle with confectioners' sugar.

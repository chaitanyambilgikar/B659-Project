Stir together persimmons, onion, ginger, jalapeño, lime juice, and salt and let stand at room temperature while cooking lamb chops.
Pat chops dry and season with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderate heat until hot but not smoking, then cook chops about 9 minutes on each side for medium-rare. Transfer chops with tongs to a cutting board or plate and let stand, loosely covered with foil, 3 minutes before serving.
Serve lamb chops with persimmon chutney.

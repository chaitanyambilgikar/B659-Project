Make syrup: In a small saucepan simmer syrup ingredients, stirring, until sugar is dissolved, about 1 minute. Remove pan from heat and cool syrup completely. Discard zest. Syrup may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.
Just before serving, in a medium bowl combine melon balls with syrup and divide mixture among 6 stemmed glasses. Top each serving with a generous dollop of cream and garnish with grated zest.

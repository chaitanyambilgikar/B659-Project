Preheat oven to 400°F. Cook potatoes in medium pot of boiling salted water until almost tender, about 5 minutes. Drain well. Spread potatoes on heavy large baking sheet. Sprinkle with paprika, chili powder and Creole seasoning. Season with salt. Drizzle olive oil over potatoes and stir to coat.
Bake potatoes until crisp, turning with metal spatula every 10 minutes, about 40 minutes.

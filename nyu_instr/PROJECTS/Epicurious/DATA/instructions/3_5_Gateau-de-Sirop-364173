Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter and flour 13 x 9 x 2-inch metal baking pan. Sift flour, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, and 1 teaspoon salt into medium bowl. Using electric mixer, beat butter in large bowl until smooth. Add sugar and beat until blended. Beat in eggs, 1 at a time. Beat in 1 3/4 cups syrup, then evaporated milk and sour cream (batter may look curdled). Add dry ingredients and beat on lowest speed until blended. Transfer cake batter to prepared pan.
Bake cake until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 50 minutes. Cool cake in pan on rack. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover pan tightly with foil and store cake at room temperature.
Beat cream in medium bowl until peaks form. Cut cake into squares. Place on plates. Spoon whipped cream alongside; drizzle with additional syrup. Dust with powdered sugar, if desired

Whisk chopped shallots, Sherry wine vinegar, and Dijon mustard in medium bowl to blend. Gradually whisk in 1/2 cup olive oil. Season dressing to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 3 hours ahead. Cover dressing and let stand at room temperature. Rewhisk before using.)
Toss mixed baby greens in large bowl with enough dressing to coat. Divide salad among 6 plates. Heat 2 tablespoons of remaining olive oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle scallops with salt and pepper. Add scallops to skillet in single layer. Cook until scallops are just opaque in center and lightly browned and all juices have evaporated, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer scallops to plate.
Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in same skillet over high heat. Add sausage and sauté until crisp, about 3 minutes. Return scallops to skillet and stir just until heated through, about 30 seconds. Sprinkle scallop and andouille sausage mixture around salads, dividing equally. Drizzle scallop and andouille sausage mixture with some of remaining dressing. Sprinkle with parsley and serve.
* Smoked pork-and-beef sausages, sold at specialty foods stores and supermarkets. Kielbasa can be substituted.

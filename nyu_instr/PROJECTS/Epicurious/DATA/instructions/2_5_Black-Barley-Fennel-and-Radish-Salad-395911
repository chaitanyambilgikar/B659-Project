Preheat oven to 425°F. Place barley in a medium pot and add water to cover by 1 1/2". Season with salt. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer uncovered until barley is tender and water is absorbed, 40-45 minutes. Spread out barley on a large rimmed baking sheet; let cool.
While barley is cooking, toss fennel slices and 2 tablespoons oil in a medium bowl to coat. Season with salt and pepper. Spread fennel slices out in a single layer on another rimmed baking sheet. Roast until fennel is crisp-tender and beginning to brown in spots, about 18 minutes. Let fennel cool on baking sheet. DO AHEAD: Barley and fennel can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover separately and refrigerate.
Whisk orange juice, lime juice, shallot, 2 tablespoons dill, and zest in a medium bowl. Gradually whisk in remaining 1/2 cup oil; season orange vinaigrette with salt and pepper.
Transfer barley to a large bowl; add roasted fennel, along with any accumulated juices on baking sheet. Add half of radishes, olives, and 1/4 cup dill sprigs. Drizzle 1/2 cup orange vinaigrette over and toss to coat; season with salt and pepper. Arrange salad on a large platter.
Scatter remaining radishes, reserved fennel fronds, and remaining 1/4 cup dill sprigs over salad. Pass remaining orange vinaigrette alongside for drizzling over.

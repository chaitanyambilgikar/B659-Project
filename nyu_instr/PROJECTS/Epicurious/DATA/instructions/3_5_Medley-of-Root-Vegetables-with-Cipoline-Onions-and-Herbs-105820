Preheat oven to 425°F. Spray large rimmed baking sheet with nonstick spray. Mix thyme and next 3 ingredients in large bowl. Transfer half of herb mixture to small bowl; set aside. Add oil to herb mixture in large bowl. Transfer 1 1/2 tablespoons herb-oil mixture to medium bowl; add beets and toss to coat. Add remaining vegetables to herb-oil mixture in large bowl; toss to coat. Transfer vegetables and beets to prepared baking sheet, placing beets in 1 corner to avoid coloring other vegetables. Sprinkle vegetables with salt and pepper. Roast until brown and tender, stirring once, about 40 minutes.
Mix broth and balsamic vinegar into reserved herb mixture in small bowl. Pour over roasted vegetables. Roast until liquid evaporates and vegetables are slightly glazed, about 5 minutes. Serve hot or at room temperature.

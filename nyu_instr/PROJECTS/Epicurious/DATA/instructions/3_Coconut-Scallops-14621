Preheat oven to 350°F.
In a small bowl stir together coconut and water. Drain coconut in a sieve and pat dry. On a baking sheet spread coconut in one layer and bake in middle of oven until pale golden, about 10 minutes. In a bowl stir together coconut, cayenne, and salt.
Remove tough muscle from side of each scallop if necessary. Pat scallops dry and season with salt and pepper. In 2 separate shallow bowls have ready flour and lightly beaten egg. Dredge scallops in flour, shaking off excess. Dip each scallop in egg, letting excess drip off, and coat well with coconut.
In a 10-inch skillet heat oil over moderate heat until hot but not smoking and cook scallops until golden and just cooked through, about 1 1/2 minutes on each side. Drain scallops on paper towels.
Serve scallops with lime wedges.

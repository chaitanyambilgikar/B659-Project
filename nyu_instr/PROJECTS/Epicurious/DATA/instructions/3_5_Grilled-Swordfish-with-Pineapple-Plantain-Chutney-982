For Chutney: Melt 2 tablespoons butter in heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add plantain; sauté until golden, about 8 minutes. Remove from heat. Mix pineapple, 1/2 cup wine, stock and chili in heavy medium saucepan. Stir over medium heat until most of liquid evaporates and pineapple is soft, about 10 minutes. Add plantain and stir to blend. Season with salt and pepper.
For fish: Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat) or preheat broiler. Mix lime juice, shallots and honey in blender. Gradually add oil and blend well. Brush mixture liberally over fish. Season fish with salt and pepper.
Grill fish until cooked through, basting with lime mixture, about 4 minutes per side. Serve with chutney.

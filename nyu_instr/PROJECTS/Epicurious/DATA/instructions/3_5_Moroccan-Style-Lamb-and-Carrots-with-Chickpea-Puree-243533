Roast lamb chops and carrots: Put a 4-sided sheet pan in lower third of oven and preheat oven to 450°F.
Whisk together oil, spices, and 1 teaspoon salt. Toss carrots with half of spiced oil and coat chops with remaining oil. Arrange chops and carrots side by side in hot sheet pan. Roast, turning and stirring halfway through, until carrots are just tender and chops are medium-rare, 4 to 6 minutes total for lamb; 10 to 15 for carrots.
Meanwhile, make chickpea purée: With food processor running, drop garlic through feed tube to finely chop. Add chickpeas, water, cumin, and 1/4 teaspoon salt and purée. With motor running, slowly add oil and blend until smooth.
Serve lamb and carrots on a bed of chickpea purée. Drizzle with pan juices.

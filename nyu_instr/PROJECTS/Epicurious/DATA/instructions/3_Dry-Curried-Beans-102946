If using desiccated coconut, soak in warm water to cover 1 hour and drain well in a sieve.
Heat oil in a 3-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat until hot but not smoking, then cook mustard seeds, cumin, dals, asafetida, chile, and curry leaves, stirring occasionally, until mustard seeds begin to pop. Stir in beans, water, and salt to taste and simmer, covered, until beans are just tender and most of water is evaporated, 6 to 8 minutes. Stir in coconut.
* Dals are dried legumes.

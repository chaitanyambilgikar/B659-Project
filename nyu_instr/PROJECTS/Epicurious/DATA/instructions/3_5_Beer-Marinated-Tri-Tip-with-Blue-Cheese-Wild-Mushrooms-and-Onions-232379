For beef: Combine first 5 ingredients in large heavy-duty resealable plastic bag; shake to blend and seal. Chill overnight.
For mushrooms and onions: Place mushrooms and onions on rimmed baking sheet. Whisk oil, garlic, and vinegar in small bowl; season with salt and pepper. Brush vegetables with some dressing.
Spray grill rack with nonstick spray and prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Grill mushrooms and onions until tender and lightly browned, turning occasionally, about 8 minutes. Return vegetables to same baking sheet; cut into 1/2-inch-thick strips.
Boil all broth in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat until reduced to 1 cup, about 12 minutes. Add cream, mushrooms, and onions. Boil until sauce coats vegetables, tossing occasionally, about 6 minutes. Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper. Set aside.
Drain marinade from beef into medium saucepan; boil 2 minutes. Cook beef over hottest part of grill until brown, about 5 minutes per side. Move beef to coolest part of grill; cover and cook until thermometer inserted into center registers 135°F for medium-rare, turning occasionally and basting with marinade, about 30 minutes. Transfer to cutting board; let rest 10 minutes.
Rewarm mushroom sauce. Thinly slice beef across grain. Overlap slices on platter. Spoon some sauce over; sprinkle with cheese and fresh herbs.

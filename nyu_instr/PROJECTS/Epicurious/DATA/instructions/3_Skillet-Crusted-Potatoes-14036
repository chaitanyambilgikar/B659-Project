In a large saucepan cover potatoes with salted cold water by 1 inch and simmer potatoes 10 to 15 minutes, or until just tender. Drain potatoes in a colander and cool. Potatoes may be prepared up to this point 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.
Halve potatoes crosswise. In a 10- to 12-inch non-stick skillet heat 1 1/2 tablespoons oil with 1/2 tablespoon thyme and salt to taste over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and add half of potatoes, cut sides down. Cook potatoes, without stirring, until cut sides are golden and crusty, about 5 minutes, and toss potatoes, shaking skillet, to coat with oil.
Transfer cooked potatoes to a serving bowl and cook remaining potatoes with remaining oil and thyme in same manner.

In a large soup pot, heat 1 1/2 tbsp oil on medium heat and sauté chicken 3 or 4 minutes or until opaque. Remove chicken from pot and add remaining 1 1/2 tbsp oil, leek, garlic, sage and nutmeg. Cook until leek is soft, 2 or 3 minutes. Transfer mixture to a small bowl, leaving excess oil in pot, and set aside. Add mushrooms to pot and cook until golden brown. Return chicken and leek mixture to pot, salt and pepper to taste and sauté about 5 minutes. Pour in broth and sherry and bring to a simmer. Add cornstarch mixture and simmer 2 or 3 minutes more. Pour soup into 4 large bowls and garnish with parsley to taste. Serve immediately.

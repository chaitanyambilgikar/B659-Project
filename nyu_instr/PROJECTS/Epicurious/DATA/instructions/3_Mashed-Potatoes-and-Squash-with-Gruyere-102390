Preheat oven to 350°F. Spray baking sheet with nonstick spray. Place squash halves, cut side down, on prepared sheet. Bake until squash is very tender when pierced with fork, about 1 hour. Scoop out squash pulp; transfer to bowl and mash until almost smooth.
Meanwhile, cook potatoes and garlic in large saucepan of boiling salted water until potatoes are very tender, about 20 minutes. Drain. Return potato mixture to saucepan and mash until almost smooth. Add squash and mash to blend well. Stir in 3 tablespoons cheese. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer mashed vegetable mixture to 9-inch-diameter glass pie dish. Sprinkle with remaining 1 tablespoon cheese. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
Preheat oven to 450#&176;F. Bake vegetable mixture until heated through, about 15 minutes if at room temperature or 25 minutes if chilled. Serve hot.

Cook pasta in pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite. Drain well; reserve 1/4 cup cooking liquid.
Meanwhile, heat oil from tomatoes in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add garlic and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add chopped tomatoes and white wine. Boil until wine is reduced slightly, about 3 minutes. Add arugula; toss until wilted, about 1 minute.
Add pasta and 4 tablespoons Parmesan cheese to sauce in skillet. Toss until well blended. Moisten pasta with reserved cooking liquid, if desired. Season pasta to taste with salt and pepper.
Transfer pasta to plates. Sprinkle with remaining cheese and serve.

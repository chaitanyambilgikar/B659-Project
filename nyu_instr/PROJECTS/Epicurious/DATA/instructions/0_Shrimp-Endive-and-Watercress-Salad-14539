Make court bouillon: In a kettle simmer court bouillon ingredients 30 minutes.
Bring court bouillon to a boil and add shrimp. Boil shrimp until just cooked through, about 2 minutes. Drain shrimp in a large sieve set over a bowl and cool completely. Shell shrimp.
With a mortar and pestle or in a cleaned electric coffee/spice grinder finely crush or grind caraway seeds. In a bowl whisk together caraway, vinegar, sugar, and salt and pepper to taste until sugar is dissolved and whisk in oil until emulsified. Add shrimp and toss to coat.
Discard coarse stems from watercress and break remainder into bite-size sprigs. Halve endives and core. Cut endives lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick strips and add with watercress to shrimp mixture, tossing to combine well.

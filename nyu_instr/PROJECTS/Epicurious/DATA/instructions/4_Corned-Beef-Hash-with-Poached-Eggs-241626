For poached eggs: Pour enough water into large roasting pan to reach depth of 2 inches; set near stove. Pour enough water into large nonstick skillet to reach depth of 1 1/2 inches; add 1 teaspoon salt and bring to simmer. Crack each egg into separate custard cup. Working with 4 eggs per batch, gently slide 1 egg at a time into simmering water in skillet. Cook just until egg whites are set, about 1 minute (yolks will be only partially cooked). Using slotted spoon, carefully transfer eggs to prepared roasting pan with water. Reserve skillet with water. DO AHEAD: Poached eggs can be made 1 hour ahead. Let stand at room temperature.
For corned beef hash: Heat large nonstick skillet over medium heat; add fat trimmings and sauté until light brown and fat renders, about 3 minutes. Add red onion to skillet and sauté until soft, about 5 minutes. Add cabbage and chopped root vegetable mixture and sauté 5 minutes. Transfer vegetable mixture to bowl; stir in corned beef and potatoes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Add beaten eggs and toss to coat.
Melt butter in same skillet over medium-high heat. Add corned beef hash mixture and cook until golden brown on bottom, occasionally pressing down with spatula, about 4 minutes. Turn hash mixture over in small portions and cook until second side is golden brown, occasionally pressing down with spatula, about 3 more minutes.
Meanwhile, bring water in reserved skillet to simmer. Using slotted spoon, gently transfer eggs back to skillet. Cook just until yolks are softly set, about 2 minutes.
Divide corned beef hash among plates. Top hash with one or two poached eggs and serve.

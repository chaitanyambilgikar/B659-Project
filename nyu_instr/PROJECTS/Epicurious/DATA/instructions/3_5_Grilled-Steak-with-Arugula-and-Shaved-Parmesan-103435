Blend garlic, 2 teaspoons oil and black pepper in small food processor (or mash on plate with back of fork) to form paste. Pat steaks dry with paper towels. Rub garlic paste over both sides of steaks. Let stand at room temperature 30 minutes or refrigerate up to 8 hours. Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Grill steaks to desired doneness, about 9 minutes per side for medium-rare. Transfer steaks to cutting board. Let stand 5 minutes. Cut steaks on slight angle into 1/4-inch-thick slices.
Arrange arugula on platter. Top with steak slices. Pour any accumulated juices over steaks; sprinkle with salt. Drizzle 1 tablespoon oil over steaks. Using vegetable peeler, shave Parmesan into strips over steaks. Serve with lemon wedges.

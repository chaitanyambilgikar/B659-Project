Remove peel and white pith from oranges. Cut oranges between membranes and release segments into bowl.
Stir remaining ingredients in small saucepan over medium-low heat just until syrup is bubbling at edges, about 6 minutes. Pour mixture over orange segments. Refrigerate until cold, about 1 hour. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Keep refrigerated.)

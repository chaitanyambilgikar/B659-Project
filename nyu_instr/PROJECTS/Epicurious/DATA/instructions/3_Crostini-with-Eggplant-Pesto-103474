Peel eggplant, leaving a few narrow bands of skin intact. Cut eggplant crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick rounds. Place on large baking sheet; sprinkle lightly with salt. Let stand 30 minutes.
Preheat broiler. Rinse eggplant; pat dry with paper towels. Brush large baking sheet with olive oil. Brush eggplant rounds generously on both sides with olive oil. Place on prepared sheet. Broil eggplant until tender and golden brown, watching closely to avoid burning, about 6 minutes per side. Cool.
Finely grind pine nuts and garlic in processor. Add eggplant and process to coarse puree. Transfer mixture to small bowl. Stir in chopped basil, parsley and mint. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Bring to room temperature before continuing.)
Place eggplant pesto in center of platter and surround with toasts, or spread toasts with eggplant pesto and arrange on platter. Garnish with basil leaves and serve.

Rinse rice in several changes of cold water until water is clear, then drain well in a large fine-mesh sieve. Bring rice and water (3 3/4 cups) to a boil in a 4-quart wide heavy pot and boil, uncovered, without stirring, until steam holes appear in rice and grains on surface look dry, 5 to 7 minutes. Reduce heat to very low, then cover pot with a tight-fitting lid and simmer 15 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, 5 minutes. Gently fluff rice with a fork.

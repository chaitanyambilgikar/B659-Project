For ice cream: Mix Grand Marnier and orange peel in large bowl. Scoop ice cream into bowl and whisk just until combined. Cover and freeze until ice cream is firm, at least 4 hours. (Can be prepared 3 days ahead.)
For sauce: Scrape seeds from vanilla bean into heavy medium saucepan; add bean. Add frozen berries, cassis and sugar and cook over medium heat until berries thaw and sugar dissolves, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes. Increase heat; bring to boil. Discard bean. Puree mixture in processor. Strain through sieve set over bowl, pressing on solids. Cover and chill until cold. (Can be made 3 days ahead.)
Spoon 1 tablespoon sauce into each of 6 parfait glasses. Top with scoop of ice cream. Sprinkle with some chopped toffee and fresh berries. Repeat layering. Garnish with mint.

In a 5- to 6-quart heavy kettle bring wine and cream to a boil with garlic, shallot, lemongrass, and curry powder. Add mussels and cook, covered, over moderately high heat 4 to 6 minutes, or until opened, discarding any unopened ones and lemongrass. Using a slotted spoon divide mussels among 4 bowls.
Add to liquid remaining in kettle scallion, butter, and salt and pepper to taste, stirring until butter is incorporated, and spoon over mussels.

Peel parsnips and cut into 3- by 1/4-inch sticks. Cut leeks crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick rounds and wash well. Trim stalks flush with fennel bulb and cut each bulb lengthwise into 8 wedges.
In a heavy saucepan melt 3 tablespoons butter over moderate heat and stir in parsnips, leeks, fennel, garlic, thyme, sugar, and salt and pepper to taste. Add wine and simmer mixture, covered, stirring occasionally, 15 to 20 minutes, or until vegetables are tender. Stir in remaining tablespoon butter and salt and pepper to taste.

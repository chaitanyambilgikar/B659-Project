Whisk together oil, crème fraîche, vinegar, sugar (if using), 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a large bowl. Coarsely chop tomatoes and toss with shallot and dressing. Marinate until ready to use, at least 10 minutes.
While tomatoes stand, cook fusilli in a pasta pot of well-salted boiling water until al dente. Drain in a colander and immediately add to tomato mixture, tossing to combine. Cool to warm or room temperature (do not chill), tossing occasionally, then stir in herbs.

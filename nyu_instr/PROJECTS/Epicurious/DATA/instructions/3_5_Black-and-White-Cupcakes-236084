Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Line 2 muffin tins with cupcake papers.
In a medium bowl, beat the cream cheese, egg, and one third cup of sugar on the medium speed of an electric mixer until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Stir in the chocolate chips and set aside.
In a large bowl, thoroughly combine the flour, the remaining cup of sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and add the water, oil, vinegar, and vanilla. Mix the wet and dry ingredients until just blended.
Fill each muffin cup one-third full with the cocoa batter, then top with a spoonful of the cream cheese mixture until the paper is about two-thirds full. Bake 25 to 30 minutes, or until the tops spring back when lightly touched. Let the cupcakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes. Remove from the pans and cool completely on a wire rack.

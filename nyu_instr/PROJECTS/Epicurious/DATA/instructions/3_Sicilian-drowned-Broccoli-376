Cut stalks from broccoli. Peel stalks, cut into 3-inch segments and thinly slice lengthwise. Separate broccoli crowns into florets. Heat olive oil in heavy large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add broccoli stalks and florets, sliced onions and chopped fresh parsley and sauté until onions are tender, about 10 minutes. Mix in cheese, chopped olives and anchovy fillets. Stir mixture 2 minutes. Add dry red wine and stir mixture to blend well. Reduce heat to low, cover Dutch oven and simmer 45 minutes.
Uncover Dutch oven and cook broccoli until very tender and wine evaporates, about 15 minutes longer. Season broccoli to taste with salt and pepper and serve.

In a small heavy saucepan cook carrot in oil over moderate heat, stirring, until softened and transfer to a bowl.
In pan stir together water, bulgur, and salt and bring to boil. Cook mixture, covered, over low heat 12 minutes, or until liquid is absorbed. Remove pan from heat and let bulgur stand, covered, 5 minutes. Stir in carrot, scallions, and salt and pepper to taste.

1. Place the chicken bones in a 6- to 8-quart stockpot, add the cold water, and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon and skimming the white foam from the top of the stock. (Using a ladle and a circular motion, push the foam from the center to the outside of the pot, where it is easy to remove.) Turn down to a simmer and skim again. It is important to have a clean stock before you add the other ingredients, because the foam is impure and should not be cooked into the stock; if the stock is not clean before you add the herbs and spices, you will wind up skimming them off, altering the flavor of the recipe. However, there is no need to skim the fat; it will flavor the stock during the cooking and can be removed after straining.
2. Add the onions, celery, carrots, garlic, bay leaves, parsley stems, thyme, cloves, and peppercorns and simmer slowly for 3 hours, gently stirring a few times. Top the stock off with water if the level goes below the bones. Towards the end of the cooking time, season the stock lightly with salt and start tasting it for doneness.
3. Strain the stock through a fine-mesh sieve. If you are not going to be using it within the hour, chill it as quickly as possible. You can skim the fat while the stock is still warm, but the easiest way is to wait until the fat solidifies at the top of the chilled stock, then just remove it in one piece. Cover the broth after it has completely cooled and keep refrigerated for up to 3 days, or freeze for up to 2 months.
Follow my recipe, but dont be afraid to add a bit more chicken, onion, carrot, and/or celery. The vegetables for the stock can be coarsely chopped, in large pieces — the cooking time is ample to extract all of their flavor.
For equipment, you will need a 7- to 8-quart stockpot, a ladle, and a fine-mesh strainer.

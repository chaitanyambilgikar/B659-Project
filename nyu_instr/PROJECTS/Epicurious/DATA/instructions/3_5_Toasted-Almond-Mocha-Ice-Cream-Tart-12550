Make the crust: In a bowl stir together with a fork the wafer crumbs, the almonds, and the butter until the mixture is combined well, pat the mixture onto the bottom and side of an oiled 10-inch fluted tart pan with a removable rim, and freeze the crust for 30 minutes, or until it is firm.
Make the filling: In a food processor blend the almonds, scraping down the sides occasionally, for 5 minutes, or until they form a nut butter, and with the motor running add the Amaretto. Add the ice cream and the chocolate and pulse the motor 6 to 8 times, or until the filling is smooth and combine well.
Transfer the filling to the crust, spreading it evenly. Garnish the top of the tart with the almonds and the chocolate and freeze the tart, uncovered, for 1 hour. Cover the tart with plastic wrap and freeze it overnight.

In a bowl, combine all raita ingredients and set aside.
Heat olive and sesame oils in a medium saucepan over high heat. Sauté ginger and garlic about 45 seconds. Add shrimp and chile paste, tossing to cook evenly, about 3 minutes. Add lemon juice and stir. Serve raita with shrimp; garnish with chives.

Heat the oven to 375°F. Wash the fig leaves, and put them on the table, shiny side up. Put the fish in the middle of each leaf. Oil the fish on both sides, and sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Fold up the fig leaf over the fish to make a package. Put the folded side down when you place it on a baking sheet or on the grill so that it will stay closed. If you're baking the fish, pour about 1/4 cup water on the baking sheet.
Put the baking sheet with the four packages in the oven for about 10 minutes. (If grilling the fish, cook 3 to 4 minutes on one side, then turn it over and cook for another 3 to 4 minutes.) To see if it is done, open up one of the packages and look at the center of the fish. If it's white and flaky all through, it's done. Remember, it will continue to cook a bit after you take it out of the oven, so don't cook it too much. Put the packages on plates, and let each person open their own. It is good with a squeeze of lemon and a little extra salt.

Place one 1/2-inch-thick round of goat cheese (cut from log) on each of 6 plates. Spray cooling rack with nonstick spray and place over rimmed baking sheet. Stir sugar and water in heavy small saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat and boil without stirring until mixture turns light amber, occasionally brushing down pan sides with wet pastry brush and swirling pan, about 6 minutes. Remove from heat and quickly add grape clusters 1 at a time to caramel. Using slotted spoon or long fork, transfer grapes to prepared pan. Repeat with apple. Dip spoon into caramel and drizzle over goat cheese rounds on plates. Add apple wedge and grape cluster to each plate.

Preheat oven to 375°F.
Place the eggs in a medium mixing bowl and whisk until frothy. Beat in the oil and prune purée. When well blended, using a wooden spoon, beat in the carrots, minced ginger, ginger juice, and orange zest.
Combine the all-purpose flour with the bran flour, brown sugar, baking powder, and baking soda in a large bowl. When blended, add the carrot mixture, beating with a wooden spoon to incorporate.
Spoon the batter into the prepared pans. Bake for about 25 minutes, or until the edges begin to pull away from the pans and a cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean.
Remove from the oven and invert onto a wire rack. Allow to cool before serving or storing.

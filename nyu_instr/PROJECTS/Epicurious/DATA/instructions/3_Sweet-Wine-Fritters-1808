Mix first 6 ingredients in large bowl until dough forms. Knead dough in bowl until smooth, about 5 minutes. Shape dough into ball; flatten into disk. Wrap in plastic; set aside 10 minutes.
Divide dough in half. Roll out 1 disk on lightly floured surface to scant 1/8-inch thickness. Cut dough into 1/2x6-inch strips. Repeat rolling and cutting with remaining dough.
Pour oil into medium saucepan to depth of 1 1/2 inches. Heat oil to 350°F. Working in batches of 4 cookies, fry until golden. Using slotted spoon, transfer to paper towels; drain. Sift sugar over. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Store in airtight container at room temperature.)

In a blender blend citrus juices and marmalade until combined well. Pour 1/2 cup juice mixture into a bowl and stir in sugar until sugar is dissolved. Reserve juice mixture in bowl.
Add onion and gingerroot to juice mixture in blender and purée until smooth. Transfer mixture to a shallow baking dish just large enough to hold salmon in one layer and stir in coriander. Arrange salmon, skin side up, in baking dish. Marinate salmon, covered and chilled, 1 hour.
Prepare grill.
Remove salmon from marinade and discard marinade. Pat salmon dry. Season salmon with salt and pepper and grill, skin side down, on an oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals 4 minutes. Put lid on grill and grill salmon until just cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes more. (Alternatively, salmon may be grilled in a hot well-seasoned ridged grill pan with a lid over moderate heat.) Carefully transfer salmon with a metal spatula to a platter and remove skin.
Pour reserved juice mixture over salmon and serve with grilled mango.

Turn over and marinate another hour. Drain, reserving the marinade. Place spareribs in the shallow baking pan. Bake in moderate 350°F. oven 20 minutes on each side, brushing or basting with marinade every 10 minutes. Finish cooking by browning both sides of ribs under the broiler. If a high glaze is desired, brush lightly with honey before placing under broiler.

Prepare the salad on a large flat platter from which it can be served. First slice the onion and separate it into rings. Spread these on the platter. Slice the tomatoes, almost 1/2 inch thick, onto the onion rings and dust them with the salt and sugar. Sprinkle each slice with a grind of fresh pepper and chopped herbs. Sprinkle all with celery seed and French dressing. Cover the platter with aluminum foil and set it in the refrigerator to gain flavor until supper time. Serve Belgian Tomatoes with cold cuts, cheese and crusty garlic bread for a snack supper.

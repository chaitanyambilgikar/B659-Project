Arrange the bacon on a double thickness of microwave-safe paper towels, top it with a double thickness of microwave-safe paper towels, and microwave it at high power (100%) for 2 minutes. Let the bacon cool and crumble it coarse. In a microwave-safe baking dish combine the pearl onions with a tablespoon water and microwave them, covered with a microwave-safe lid, at high power (100%) for 1 minute. Transfer the onions to a bowl, let them cool, and peel them. In the dish microwave the chopped onion and the garlic in the butter, covered with the lid, at high power (100%), stirring after 2 minutes, for 5 minutes. Add the mushrooms, the broth, the wine, the Worcestershire sauce, the thyme, and salt and pepper to taste and microwave the mixture, covered with lid, at high power (100%) for 10 minutes. Add the chicken, the bacon, and the pearl onions, baste them with the cooking liquid, and microwave the mixture, covered with the lid, for 10 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through. Serve the mixture with the rice.

Finely grind almonds in processor. Add breadcrumbs, 1/4 cup water, lemon juice and garlic and process until thick and smooth, about 2 minutes. With machine running, gradually add olive oil through feed tube. Mix in enough water to make thick creamy sauce. Season to taste with salt. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Bring to room temperature before serving.)

Discard Gorgonzola rind and in a small bowl stir together cheese and butter until smooth. On a sheet of plastic wrap form Gorgonzola butter into a log about 4 inches long. Chill log, wrapped in plastic wrap, until firm, at least 1 hour. Butter may be made 1 week ahead.
Preheat oven to 450°F.
In a 12-inch heavy skillet (preferably cast-iron) heat 1 1/2 tablespoons oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and sear half of steaks until browned, about 2 minutes on each side, transferring to a shallow baking pan. Sear remaining steaks in remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons oil in same manner.
When steaks are just cool enough to handle, spread tops and sides with mustard and sprinkle with rosemary, pepper, and salt to taste. Roast steaks in middle of oven 8 minutes for medium-rare (coating should just begin to brown). Transfer steaks to a cutting board and let stand about 3 minutes. Cut butter into about 20 thin slices.
Cut each steak in half horizontally. Tuck a butter slice between steak halves and top steaks with another butter slice.

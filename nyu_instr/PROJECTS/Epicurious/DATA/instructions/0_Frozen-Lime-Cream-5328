For pastry cream: Whisk flour, sugar and yolks in medium bowl to blend. Bring milk to simmer in heavy medium saucepan. Gradually whisk hot milk into yolk mixture. Return mixture to same saucepan. Whisk over medium heat until pastry cream thickens and simmers, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Whisk in lime juice and peel. Cool.
For meringue: Combine 1/2 cup sugar and water in heavy small saucepan. Stir over low heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat; boil until thermometer inserted into mixture registers 240°F., tilting pan to submerge bulb, about 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, beat egg whites in large bowl until soft peaks form. Add 2 tablespoons sugar; beat until stiff but not dry.
Slowly pour boiling syrup into whites, beating until cool, about 5 minutes.
Whisk 1/4 of meringue into pastry cream. Fold in remaining meringue. Freeze lime cream until firm, about 8 hours. (Can be made 2 days ahead.)

Sprinkle steaks with salt and pepper. Heat oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Add steaks; cook to desired doneness, about 5 minutes per side for medium-rare. Transfer steaks to platter. Add 2 tablespoons parsley and garlic to skillet; stir 30 seconds. Add broth, then brandy. Boil until juices are reduced to glaze, about 6 minutes. Spoon glaze over steaks. Sprinkle with remaining 1 tablespoon parsley.

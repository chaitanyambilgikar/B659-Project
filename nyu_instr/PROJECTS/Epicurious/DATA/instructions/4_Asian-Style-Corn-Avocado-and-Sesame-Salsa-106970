Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Brush corn all over with 1 1/2 teaspoons sesame oil. Grill until corn is tender and brown in spots, turning frequently, about 10 minutes. Cool.
Cut corn kernels off cobs. Mix vinegar, green onions, sesame seeds, chili paste, garlic, and remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons oil in medium bowl. Add corn and avocado; toss gently to combine. Season salsa to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.)
* Available in the Asian foods section of some supermarkets.

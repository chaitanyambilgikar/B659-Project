Combine mayonnaise, 1 tablespoon shallots, 1 teaspoon mustard, buttermilk and juice in a bowl; set aside. Combine salmon, egg whites, remaining 1/4 cup shallots, capers, breadcrumbs, remaining 1 tsp mustard, salt and pepper in another bowl; mix well; shape into eight 3-inch-round patties. Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Cook salmon cakes until bottom is golden, about 6 minutes; flip and cook until golden, 5 minutes more. Toss greens with half the buttermilk mixture; divide salad among 4 plates; top each with 2 salmon cakes. Serve with remaining dressing on the side.

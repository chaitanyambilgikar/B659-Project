Mix mayonnaise, chutney, and curry powder in small bowl. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Spread 2 tablespoons curry-chutney mayonnaise in 2-inch-wide strip down center of 1 tortilla. Top with 1/2 cup turkey, 1/4 cup cilantro, 1 1/2 tablespoons peanuts, and 1/3 cup coleslaw mix. Fold sides of tortilla over ends of filling, then roll up burrito-style, enclosing filling completely. Repeat with remaining ingredients. Cut each turkey wrap in half on diagonal.

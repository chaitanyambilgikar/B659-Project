Cook potatoes in large pot of boiling salted water until tender when pierced with fork, about 50 minutes. Drain well. Cool slightly and peel.
Cut potatoes into large chunks; place in processor. Add milk, butter, ginger juice, and five-spice powder. Process until very smooth, about 1 minute. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Return to pot and stir over medium heat until warmed through, about 5 minutes. (Can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand, uncovered, at room temperature. Rewarm over medium heat, stirring frequently, before serving.)
*A blend of cinnamon, cloves, fennel seeds, star anise and pepper available in the spice section of most supermarkets.

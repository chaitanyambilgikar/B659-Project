Heat 3 tablespoons oil in heavy medium skillet over medium heat. Add chopped onion and 2 minced garlic cloves and sauté until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add chopped tomatoes, sage leaves and rosemary sprig to skillet. Simmer tomato mixture until reduced to 1 1/2 cups thick purée, about 30 minutes. Set aside.
Preheat oven to 425°F. Roll out 1 puff pastry sheet to thickness of 1/8 inch. Using 7-inch-diameter plate as guide, cut out 3 pastry dough rounds. Repeat with remaining puff pastry sheet, forming a total of 6 rounds. Place 3 rounds on each of 2 large baking sheets.
Spread generous 2 tablespoons tomato purée over each puff pastry round, leaving 1/2-inch border around edge. Arrange tomato rounds over purée on pastry. Sprinkle tomatoes with salt and pepper. Bake until tart crusts are golden, about 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, mix fresh basil and remaining 2 minced garlic cloves in bowl. Gradually whisk in remaining 1/3 cup oil.
Drizzle 1 tablespoon basil-oil mixture over each tartlet and serve.

1. Combine the wine, vinegar, and oil in a medium bowl or other nonreactive container. Stir in the shallots, garlic, parsley, bay leaves, thyme, oregano, and salt and white pepper to taste. Cover and allow the flavors to blend for at least 1 hour before using. (The marinade can be covered and refrigerated for up to 1 week.
2. If you are using wooden skewers, place them in cold water to cover for at least 1 hour. Remove the skewers from the water just before you are ready to use them.
3. One to two hours before you are ready to grill, place the poultry or meat in a shallow nonreactive container. Pour the speidie sauce over the top. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 2 hours, turning occasionally. If using the vegetables, add them to the marinade with the meat about 15 minutes before you are ready to grill.
4. Preheat the grill. Oil the grill rack.
5. Thread the poultry or meat cubes (and vegetables, if using) onto skewers, (alternating poultry or meat with the vegetables, if using, and beginning and ending with poultry or meat.) If using wooden skewers, you might want to wrap the tips in aluminum foil to keep them from burning. Place the kabobs on the grill and grill, turning frequently, for about 8 minutes, or until the meat is cooked to the desired degree of doneness (and the vegetables are crisp-tender.) Serve hot off the grill, with toasted pita bread, if desired.

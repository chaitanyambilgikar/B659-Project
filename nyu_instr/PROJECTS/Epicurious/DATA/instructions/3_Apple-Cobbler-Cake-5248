Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter 13x9x2-inch baking pan. Place apples in large bowl. Add 1 cup sugar, cinnamon, 2 tablespoons flour and lemon juice and toss to blend well.
Stir in 1 cup sugar, 3 cups flour, baking powder and salt in medium bowl to blend. Whisk eggs, melted butter, 1/2 cup water and vanilla extract in small bowl to blend. Add egg mixture to dry ingredients and stir until thick dough forms. Spread 1 3/4 cups dough over bottom of prepared pan. Top with apple mixture. Drop remaining dough by tablespoonfuls evenly over apple mixture. Sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoons sugar. Cover pan tightly with foil.
Bake cake covered 30 minutes. Uncover pan. Bake until cake is golden brown and apples are tender, about 45 minutes longer. Transfer pan to rack; cool cake 30 minutes. Cut cake into squares and serve warm.

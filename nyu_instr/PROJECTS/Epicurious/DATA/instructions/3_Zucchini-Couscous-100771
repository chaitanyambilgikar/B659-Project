Cut zucchini into 1/4-inch dice. In a large non-stick skillet cook zucchini in oil with cumin and salt and pepper to taste over moderate heat, stirring, until just tender, about 5 minutes. Add water and bring to a boil. Stir in couscous and remove skillet from heat. Let mixture stand, covered, 5 minutes. Fluff couscous with a fork.

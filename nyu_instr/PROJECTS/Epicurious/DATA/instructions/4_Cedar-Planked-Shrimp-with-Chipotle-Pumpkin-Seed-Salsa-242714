Prepare barbecue (high heat). Place bell peppers on grill rack. Cover and grill until peppers are blistered and blackened on all sides, turning frequently, about 15 minutes. (Or char peppers over gas flame or in broiler until blackened on all sides.) Enclose peppers in paper bag and let stand 10 minutes. Peel, seed, and coarsely chop peppers.
Sauté pepitas in small dry skillet over medium heat until lightly toasted, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and cool in skillet.
With processor running, drop garlic cloves through feed tube and finely chop. Add bell peppers, pepitas, chipotle chile, vinegar, and oregano and process until finely chopped. With machine running, gradually add oil and process until mixture is almost smooth. Season salsa to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer to bowl. DO AHEAD: Can be made 3 days ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Bring to room temperature before using.
Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).. Place cedar planks on hot grill rack and heat until cedar begins to smoke, 10 to 20 minutes depending on thickness of cedar. Turn cedar planks over. Arrange 12 shrimp on each plank. Cover and grill shrimp without turning until just opaque in center, about 5 minutes. Transfer planks with shrimp to heatproof platter. Serve hot or at room temperature with salsa for dipping.
* Dried, smoked jalapeños in a spicy tomato sauce called adobo; available at some supermarkets and at specialty foods stores and Latin markets.
More info: Look for cedar planks at cookware stores or order them online from fireandflavor.com or natures-cuisine.com. Look for planks that are about 3/4 inch thick (thinner ones can burn and warp on the grill). Be sure to buy natural planks, which are sometimes labeled "untreated." Avoid cedar shingles, as they may be treated with chemicals. When soaking planks, weigh them down so they're covered by the water.

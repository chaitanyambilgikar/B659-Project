Preheat oven to 375°F. Cut bread lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick slices. In a saucepan melt butter and stir in seasoning and salt. Brush spice butter on 1 side of slices and on a baking sheet bake, buttered sides up, in middle of oven until golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Toasts keep in an airtight container at room temperature 3 days.

Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onion and sauté until soft, about 4 minutes. Add corn kernels, broth, and 1 tablespoon lime juice; bring mixture to boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until corn is just tender, about 3 minutes. Working in batches, puree soup in blender until almost smooth. Stir in remaining 1 tablespoon lime juice and 1 cup water (or more as needed to thin soup to desired consistency). Season corn soup to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer soup to large bowl; cover and refrigerate until chilled, about 2 hours or overnight.
Meanwhile, whisk remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and adobo sauce in small bowl to blend. Divide chilled corn soup among 4 bowls. Drizzle soup with adobo oil, then garnish with cilantro and serve.

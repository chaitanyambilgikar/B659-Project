Working off heat, put 1 tablespoon oil in a 10-inch nonstick skillet and add fish, turning to coat with oil on both sides. Arrange fish skinned sides down and sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Toss together tomato, garlic (if using), basil, remaining tablespoon oil, and salt and pepper to taste in a small bowl, then mound on top of fish. Cover skillet with a tight-fitting lid and cook fish over moderately high heat until just cooked through, about 8 minutes.

Toss apples in bowl with cider and vinegar. Cut each pork tenderloin crosswise into 6 pieces; place between 2 sheets of plastic wrap. Using meat mallet, pound to 1/3-inch thickness. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Lay 6 sage leaves in bottom of skillet. Place 1 pork medallion on each sage leaf, pressing down lightly with back of spatula. Reduce heat to medium; cook until underside of pork is golden, about 3 minutes. Place 1 sage leaf on top of each pork medallion and carefully turn each piece to keep sage in place. Cook until pork is just cooked through, about 2 minutes longer.
Carefully transfer pork to plate. Repeat with remaining oil, sage, and pork. Add apple mixture to skillet; cook until liquid is reduced by about half and apples are almost tender, about 5 minutes. Return pork to skillet along with any accumulated juices; cook until heated through, about 2 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer pork and apples to serving platter. Add butter to pan juices; stir just until melted. Season sauce with salt and pepper; pour over pork and serve.

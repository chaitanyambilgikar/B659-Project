Preheat oven to 350°F. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Dredge veal in flour, shaking off excess. Add veal to skillet and cook until brown, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Transfer veal to plate using slotted spoon. Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in same skillet. Add mushrooms, bell pepper, oregano, allspice and crushed red pepper to skillet. Sauté until mushrooms are just beginning to brown, about 3 minutes. Stir in Marsala and garlic and boil until skillet is almost dry, about 4 minutes. Add veal and any juices accumulated on plate to skillet. Mix in chicken broth and bring to boil. Cover and bake in oven until veal is very tender, about 1 hour. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
Transfer stew to stove and boil until liquid thickens to sauce to consistency, about 12 minutes. Serve with rice.

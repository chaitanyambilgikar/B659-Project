Combine crabmeat, red peppers, 3 tablespoons Basil Aioli and lemon peel in large bowl. Mix in 1 1/3 cups breadcrumbs. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Mix in yolks (mixture will be soft).
Form crab mixture into eight 3/4-inch-thick cakes, using generous 1/4 cupful for each. Coat cakes on both sides with flour; shake off excess. Brush both sides with beaten whites, then coat with remaining breadcrumbs. Cover; chill at least 2 hours and up to 6 hours.
Melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Working in batches, cook cakes until golden brown and heated through, about 4 minutes per side. Place 2 cakes on each plate. Serve with remaining Basil Aioli.

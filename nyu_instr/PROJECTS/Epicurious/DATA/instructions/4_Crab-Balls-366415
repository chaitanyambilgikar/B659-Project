Mix crabmeat and 1 cup cracker crumbs in a large bowl. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add green pepper and onion; sauté until soft, about 5 minutes. Add to bowl with crab mixture. Stir in evaporated milk, Dijon mustard, Worcestershire, salt, and pepper. Cover; chill for 1-6 hours.
Using scant 1/4 cup for each, form crab mixture into sixteen 1 1/2"-diameter balls. Whisk whole milk and egg in a medium bowl. Place remaining 1 cup cracker crumbs in another medium bowl. Roll balls in egg mixture, then coat well with crumbs. Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet.
Pour oil into a large wide pot to a depth of 2". Attach a deep-fry thermometer to side of pot. Heat oil to 350°F. Working in batches and turning occasionally, fry crab balls until golden brown, 4-6 minutes per batch. Transfer to paper towels.

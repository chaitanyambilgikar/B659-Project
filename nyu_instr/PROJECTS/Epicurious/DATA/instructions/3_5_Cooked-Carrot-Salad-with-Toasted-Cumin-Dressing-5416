Combine carrots, 1/2 cup water, garlic, coriander seeds and crushed red pepper in heavy medium saucepan. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium; cover and cook until carrots are crisp-tender, about 7 minutes. Uncover; cook until water evaporates, about 1 minute. Transfer carrot mixture to medium bowl; cool slightly.
Meanwhile, stir cumin in heavy small skillet over low heat until fragrant, about 1 minute. Remove from heat. Stir in lemon juice and oil. Pour over carrot mixture; toss to blend. Cool completely.
Mix onion and cilantro into carrot mixture. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Sprinkle olives over salad and serve. (Can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.)

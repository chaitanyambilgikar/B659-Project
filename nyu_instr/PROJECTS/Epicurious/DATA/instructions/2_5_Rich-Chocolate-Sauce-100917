Chop chocolate and transfer to a bowl. In a small saucepan bring cream with sugar just to a simmer, stirring until sugar is dissolved, and pour over chocolate. Stir mixture until chocolate is completely melted. Sauce may be kept, chilled in an airtight container, 1 week. If desired, reheat sauce in a metal bowl, stirring occasionally, over a saucepan of simmering water. Serve sauce hot or at room temperature.

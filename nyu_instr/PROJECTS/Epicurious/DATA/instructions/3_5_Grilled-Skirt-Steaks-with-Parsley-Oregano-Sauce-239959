Heat grill pan over medium-high heat until hot, then lightly oil. Pat steaks dry and sprinkle all over with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper (total).
Grill steaks, turning over occasionally, 2 to 8 minutes total for medium-rare (depending on thickness of meat). Transfer to a platter and let stand 5 minutes.
While steaks are grilling, purée remaining ingredients with 3/4 teaspoon salt in a blender until smooth.
Serve steaks with sauce.

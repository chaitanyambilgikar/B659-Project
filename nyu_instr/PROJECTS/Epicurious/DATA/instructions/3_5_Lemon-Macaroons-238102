Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 325°F. Butter a baking sheet and line with foil. Lightly butter and flour foil, knocking off excess flour.
Stir together egg whites, sugar, zest, vanilla, and a pinch of salt until combined, then stir in coconut. Drop 16 tablespoon-size mounds about 1 1/2 inches apart onto baking sheet.
Bake until tops are pale golden in spots, 15 to 20 minutes, then carefully lift foil with cookies from baking sheet and transfer to a rack to cool completely, about 10 minutes. Peel macaroons from foil to serve.

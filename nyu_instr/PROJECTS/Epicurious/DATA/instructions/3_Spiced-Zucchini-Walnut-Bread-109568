Preheat oven to 325°F. Butter and flour two 8x4x2 1/2-inch metal loaf pans. Whisk flour, cinnamon, salt, baking soda, allspice, and baking powder in medium bowl to blend. Whisk sugar, vegetable oil, eggs, vanilla, and lemon peel in large bowl to blend. Whisk in flour mixture. Mix in zucchini and walnuts. Pour batter into prepared pans.
Bake breads until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes. Turn breads out onto rack and cool completely. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Wrap in foil and store at room temperature.)

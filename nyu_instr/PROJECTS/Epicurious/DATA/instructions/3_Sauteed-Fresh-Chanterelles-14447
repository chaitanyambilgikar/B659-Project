Halve chanterelles lengthwise or cut Portobellos into 1/2-inch-thick slices. In a large non-stick skillet melt butter with oil over moderately high heat until foam subsides and sauté mushrooms, stirring, with salt and pepper to taste until barely tender, about 2 minutes. Add wine and cook, stirring, until liquid is evaporated and mushrooms are tender, about 5 minutes. In a bowl toss mushrooms with parsley and lemon juice.

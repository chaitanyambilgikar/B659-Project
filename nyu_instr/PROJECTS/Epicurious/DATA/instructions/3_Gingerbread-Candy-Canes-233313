In electric mixer, beat butter and sugar at high speed until fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add ginger, cinnamon, allspice, baking soda, and cloves and mix at low speed until blended. Beat in egg. Add 2 cups flour and mix at low speed until just combined. Beat in molasses until just blended. Add remaining 2 cups flour and mix at low speed until just combined. Divide dough into thirds, form into 3 disks, and wrap in plastic wrap or waxed paper. Chill until firm, at least 1 hour or up to 2 days.
Arrange racks in upper and lower thirds of oven and preheat to 375°F. Line 2 heavy large baking sheets with parchment paper.
Remove 1 dough disk from refrigerator. On lightly floured work surface, roll out dough to 1/4- to 1/8-inch thickness. Using 3- to 4-inch candy cane cookie cutter, cut out cookies; transfer with spatula to baking sheets. Gather and reroll scraps and cut out additional cookies. Decorate with stripes of red and green sanding sugar, then chill cookies 10 minutes.
Bake until fragrant and lightly colored, about 10 minutes. Cool on pans 2 minutes, then transfer to racks and cool completely. Repeat with remaining dough.

Season chicken with porcini powder, salt, and pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat. Sauté chicken until golden and almost cooked through, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a plate.
Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in same skillet; add mushrooms, beans, garlic, and rosemary and cook, stirring frequently, until mushrooms are golden brown. Stir in chicken broth, Marsala, and chicken strips; simmer until reduced by half, 3-4 minutes. Stir in truffle butter and unsalted butter.
Serve chicken and sauce over orzo or steamed rice.

Make broth: Cook all broth ingredients, covered, in a 4- to 5-quart heavy pot over moderately high heat until mussels just open wide, 4 to 6 minutes. Transfer mussels with a slotted spoon to a bowl and reserve for another use. (Discard any unopened mussels.) Pour broth through a coffee-filter-lined sieve into a bowl, discarding solids. Strain broth again through same lined sieve into a 2-cup glass measure and reserve 1 cup for soup. (Freeze remainder if desired.)
Make soup: Heat butter in a 1-quart heavy saucepan over moderately low heat until foam subsides. Add curry powder and cook, stirring constantly, until just a shade darker, about 1 minute. Add Madeira and bring to a boil. Add mussel broth and bring to a boil. Whisk together cream and yolk in a bowl, then add broth mixture in a slow stream, whisking constantly. Return soup to saucepan and cook over moderately low heat, stirring, until just slightly thickened and registers 170°F on thermometer, about 2 minutes. (Do not simmer.) Divide among glasses.

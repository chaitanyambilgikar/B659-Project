In a bowl whisk together flour, sugar, and salt. In another bowl whisk together eggs, milk, and club soda or seltzer and add to flour mixture in a stream, whisking. Whisk batter until smooth and chill, covered, 1 hour.
Stir batter well. Heat a non-stick skillet measuring 8 inches across bottom over moderate heat until hot. Brush skillet lightly with melted butter. Remove skillet from heat. Fill a 1/4-cup measure three fourths full with batter and pour into skillet, tilting and rotating skillet quickly to cover bottom.
Return skillet to heat and cook crêpe until underside is golden, 15 to 30 seconds. Slide crêpe onto a kitchen towel to cool. Make more crêpes in same manner with remaining batter, brushing skillet lightly with butter for each and stacking cooked crêpes on another kitchen towel as they cool. Crêpes may be made 3 days ahead and chilled, stacked and wrapped well in plastic wrap.

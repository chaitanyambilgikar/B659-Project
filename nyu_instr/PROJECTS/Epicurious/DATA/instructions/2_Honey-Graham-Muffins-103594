1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Coat a muffin tin with spray, oil, or butter and set aside.
2. Combine all the dry ingredients thoroughly in a large bowl.
3. Whisk together all the wet ingredients in a medium bowl.
4. Add the wet ingredients to the dry and mix just until evenly blended, using as few strokes as possible.
5. Fill each muffin cup with batter. Bake for about 20 minutes, or until the tops begin to brown. Remove from the pan and place on a cooling rack. For optimal taste, let cool completely before serving.

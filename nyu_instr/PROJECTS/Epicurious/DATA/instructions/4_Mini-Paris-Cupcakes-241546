For cupcakes Line 12 mini muffin tins with mini muffin papers. In a small bowl, combine flours. In another bowl, cream the butter and sugar together, beating until fluffy. Add eggs and beat well. Add half flour mixture and beat well, then add milk and vanilla and beat again. Add remaining flour mixture and beat until completely incorporated. Fill muffin papers about 3/4 full. Preheat oven to 350°F. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes. Remove cupcakes from oven and let cool.
For frosting Place butter, milk, vanilla, food coloring, and 2 cups of the confectioners' sugar in a mixing bowl. Beat on medium speed until smooth and creamy. Gradually add remaining sugar until light and fluffy.
Ice tops of cupcakes with pink frosting. Serve on a beautiful tray or tiered cake plate.

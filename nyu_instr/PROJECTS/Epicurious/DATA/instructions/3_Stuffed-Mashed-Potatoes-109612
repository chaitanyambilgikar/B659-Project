For the Mashed Potatoes: Cook the whole potatoes in water over moderate heat until soft. Mash until relatively smooth. Process the aji chili with 2 tablespoons water, the turmeric, salt, and oil until smooth. Stir the spice paste into the potatoes and mix well.
For the Chicken Filling: In a bowl combine all the filling ingredients until smooth.
For the Causa: 1. Spread half of the mashed potato in the oiled dish.
2. Spread all of the filling over the potatoes. Cover with the balance of the potatoes. Cover with plastic wrap and chill until cold.
Serve cold, cut into 2-inch-wide slices.
Extra! Tips from Epicurious: Â• This dish dates from Peruâ€™s colonial period. Derived from the Quechua (the indigenous Peruvian language) kausay, which translates as "necessary sustenance," its name is indicative of how satisfying it is. Serve causa as a main course for lunch, or serve slices as a hearty appetizer before dinner.
• Yellow aji pepper powder, also called aji amarillo, is available online at www.myspicer.com.
• Starchy Peruvian yellow potatoes are traditionally used for this dish, but Yukon golds make a fine substitute.

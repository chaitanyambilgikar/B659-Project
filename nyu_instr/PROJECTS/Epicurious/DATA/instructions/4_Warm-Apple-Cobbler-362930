For apples: Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter 13 x 9 x 2-inch glass baking dish. Toss first 5 ingredients in large bowl. Add sugar, flour, and cinnamon; toss to combine. Transfer to baking dish.
For streusel: Whisk butter, miso, and eggs in medium bowl until smooth. Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, and ginger in large bowl. Form well in center of flour mixture and add butter mixture. Using rubber spatula, toss until large clumps form.
Using fingertips, break up streusel clumps into smaller pieces and sprinkle streusel topping over apples. Bake until apple mixture is bubbling and streusel is golden brown, 50 to 55 minutes. Cool slightly. Serve cobbler slightly warm topped with vanilla ice cream.

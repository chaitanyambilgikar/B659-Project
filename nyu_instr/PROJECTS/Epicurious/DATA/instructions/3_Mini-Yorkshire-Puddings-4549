Preheat oven to 450°F. Brush 48 mini muffin cups (each about 1 3/4-inch diameter) with oil. Place muffin pans in hot oven.
Meanwhile, sift flour and salt into large bowl. Make well in center of mixture. Add eggs and 1/2 cup milk to well; stir into flour. Gradually add 3/4 cup milk and 1/4 cup water, whisking until batter is smooth. Remove hot muffin pans from oven. Spoon 1 tablespoon batter into each muffin cup. Return pans to oven; bake until puddings are puffed and golden brown around edges, about 12 minutes. Cool in pans on racks. (Can be made 1 week ahead. Cover in pans; freeze. Before assembling, uncover and rewarm in 350°F oven until heated through, about 7 minutes.)

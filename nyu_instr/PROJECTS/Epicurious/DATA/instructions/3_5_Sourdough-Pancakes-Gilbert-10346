In a bowl whisk together 1 1/2 cups of the flour, the yeast, and 1 cup of the milk and let the mixture stand in a warm place, covered loosely, overnight. Whisk 1/2 cup of the remaining milk into the starter and add the remaining 1 cup flour, the egg, the salt, the sugar, the baking soda, dissolved in 2 tablespoons hot water, 2 teaspoons of the butter, and the remaining 1/2 cup milk, whisking until the mixture is combined well. Heat a griddle over moderate heat until it is hot but not smoking and brush it with some of the oil. Drop the batter by 1/4 cups onto the griddle and cook the pancakes for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the undersides are golden brown. Turn the pancakes and cook them for 1 minute, or until the undersides are golden. Serve the pancakes with the additional butter and the maple syrup.

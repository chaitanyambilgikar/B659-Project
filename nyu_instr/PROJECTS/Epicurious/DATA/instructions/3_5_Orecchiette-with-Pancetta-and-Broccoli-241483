Cook orecchiette in a pasta pot of boiling salted water (2 tablespoons salt for 6 quarts water) until al dente.
While pasta cooks, heat butter and oil with garlic in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium-high heat until garlic starts to sizzle. Add nuts and cook, stirring, until pale golden. Discard garlic and stir in pancetta and scallions, then cook 1 minute. Stir in broccoli and 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and pepper and cook over high heat, stirring, 4 minutes.
Reserve 1/2 cup pasta-cooking water, then drain pasta and stir into broccoli mixture. Add some of reserved water to moisten if needed.

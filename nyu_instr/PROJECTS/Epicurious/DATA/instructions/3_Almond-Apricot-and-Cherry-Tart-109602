For crust: Blend first 3 ingredients in processor until almonds are finely ground. Using electric mixer, beat butter and powdered sugar in medium bowl until blended. Beat in egg. Add flour mixture; beat until blended. Gather dough into ball; flatten into square. Wrap in plastic; refrigerate 1 hour.
Roll out dough on floured surface to 10-inch square. Transfer to 9-inch square tart pan with removable bottom; press crust over bottom and up sides of pan. Trim any excess dough. Pierce crust all over with fork; chill at least 2 hours. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover; keep chilled.)
For filling: Preheat oven to 350°F. Using electric mixer, beat almond paste and 4 tablespoons sugar in medium bowl until fine meal forms, about 3 minutes. Add butter; beat until almost smooth. Add egg; beat until smooth. Beat in flour. Spread filling evenly in unbaked crust. Arrange apricot quarters on sides with rounded side up in rows atop filling. Place cherry halves between apricots. Sprinkle remaining 2 tablespoons sugar over fruit.
Bake tart 30 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 325°F. Bake until crust is golden and filling is puffed and golden, about 30 minutes longer. Cool tart in pan on rack at least 1 hour. Serve tart warm or at room temperature.

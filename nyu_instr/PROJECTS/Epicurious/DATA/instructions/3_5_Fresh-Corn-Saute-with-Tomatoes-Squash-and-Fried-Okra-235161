Mix cornmeal and 1/4 teaspoon cayenne in small bowl. Add okra and toss lightly to coat. Pour okra into sieve and shake off excess cornmeal.
Heat 4 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add okra and sauté until coating is golden brown, stirring occasionally, about 6 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer okra to paper towels to drain; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Wipe out skillet. Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in same skillet over medium heat. Add corn, squash, and garlic; sauté 2 minutes. Add tomatoes; cover and cook until squash is crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Mix in okra, cilantro, and green onions. Remove from heat. Season to taste with salt, pepper, and more cayenne, if desired.

Bring 8 cups water to a boil in a 2-quart saucepan and add tapioca, stirring constantly. Gently boil, stirring occasionally, until tapioca is almost completely translucent, 40 minutes to 1 1/2 hours, depending on size of tapioca.
Remove from heat and let tapioca stand, covered, until completely translucent, 45 minutes to 1 1/2 hours, depending on size.
While tapioca is standing, bring sugar, a pinch of salt, and remaining 1/4 cup water to a simmer in a small heavy saucepan, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Simmer syrup until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes.
Scoop out 3/4 cup (total) of thick layer of coconut cream from tops of cans (reserving remainder for another use) and whisk into syrup until combined well. Chill syrup until cold, about 1 hour.
Add 3 cups cold water to translucent tapioca, then drain in a sieve. Transfer tapioca to a large bowl filled halfway with cold water, swirl, and then drain in sieve. (This removes excess starch.)
Spoon 3 tablespoons syrup into each of 4 glasses (there will be some left over), then divide fruit and tapioca among them. Top with shaved ice.

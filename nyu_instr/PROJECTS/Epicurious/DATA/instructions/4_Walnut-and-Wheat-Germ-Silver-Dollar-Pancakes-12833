To make the pancakes: In a blender blend the flour, the baking soda, the salt, the sugar, the wheat germ, the egg, and the buttermilk for 15 seconds and scrape down the sides. Add the walnuts and blend the batter until the walnuts are just chopped fine. The batter may be made 1 day in advance and kept covered and chilled.
Heat a griddle over moderate heat until it is hot enough to make drops of water scatter over its surface and brush it with some of the oil. Working in batches, pour the batter onto the griddle in 2-inch mounds, cook the pancakes for 1 1/2 minutes on each side, or until they are golden, and transfer them as they are cooked to a heatproof platter, keeping them warm in a preheated 200°F. oven. Serve the pancakes with the blackberry syrup and the butter and garnish them with the blackberries.
To make the blackberry syrup: In a saucepan combine the blackberries and 1 cup water, bring the water to a boil, and simmer the berries, covered, for 10 minutes. Purée the mixture in a blender in batches and force it through a fine sieve into a bowl, discarding the solids. In the pan, cleaned, combine the sugar, the zest, and 2 cups water, bring the mixture to a boil, stirring until the sugar is dissolved, and boil it, uncovered, until it registers 220°F. on a candy thermometer. Remove the zest with a slotted spoon, discarding it, add the blackberry purée, and boil the syrup until it registers 210°F. Let the syrup cool, skimming off any froth, and serve it warm or at room temperature. The syrup keeps, covered and chilled, for 6 weeks. Makes about 2 cups.

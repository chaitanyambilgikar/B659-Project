With a manual citrus juicer squeeze enough juice from pomegranate half, pressing sides against center of juicer and pressing on any whole seeds in juicer with thumbs, to measure 1/4 cup. Peel and cut jícama into 1/4-inch-thick slices. On a cutting board stack slices, 2 or 3 at a time, and cut into 1/4-inch-thick sticks. In a bowl toss jícama with pomegranate juice. Chill mixture, covered, tossing occasionally, 30 minutes to allow jícama to absorb some of juice.
Have ready a bowl of ice and cold water. Trim haricots verts and in a saucepan of boiling salted water blanch 3 minutes, or until crisp-tender. Transfer beans with a slotted spoon to ice water to stop cooking and drain in a colander. Cut remaining pomegranate in half and with hands gently break in two. Bend back rinds and dislodge seeds from membranes. Coarsely chop walnuts.
To jícama mixture add beans, pomegranate seeds, parsley, oil, lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste and toss to combine.
Serve salad sprinkled with walnuts.

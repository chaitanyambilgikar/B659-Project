Stir 1/2 cup honey, 1/4 cup sugar, and 1/4 cup water in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat and boil, without stirring, 1 minute.
Meanwhile, using electric mixer, beat egg white with pinch of salt in medium bowl until soft peaks form. Gradually pour hot syrup over egg white mixture, beating constantly. Continue beating meringue until very stiff, about 4 minutes. Let stand until cool, about 10 minutes.
Beat cream in large bowl until soft peaks form. Fold into honey meringue. Fold in chopped nuts. Spoon mixture into 11x7x2-inch glass baking dish. Cover and freeze until firm, about 4 hours. (Can be prepared 1 week ahead. Keep frozen.) Spoon ice cream into bowls and serve.

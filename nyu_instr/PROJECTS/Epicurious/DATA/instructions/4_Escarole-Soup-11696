In a kettle cook the garlic in the oil over low heat, stirring, until it is pale golden, add the onion, and cook the mixture, stirring, until onion is softened. Add the broth and the orégano, bring the mixture to a boil, and add the pasta. Simmer the soup for 5 minutes, add the escarole and salt and pepper to taste, and simmer the soup for 5 minutes more. Ladle the soup into soup plates, top it with the egg slices, and sprinkle it with the Parmesan.

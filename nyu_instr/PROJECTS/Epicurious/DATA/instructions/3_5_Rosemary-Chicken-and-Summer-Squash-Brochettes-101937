Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Whisk first 5 ingredients in medium bowl. Add chicken and squash; toss. Let stand 10 minutes; toss occasionally.
Alternate 3 chicken pieces with 3 squash pieces on each skewer. Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. Grill until chicken is cooked through and squash is just tender, turning often, about 10 minutes.

Pour vinegar into small bowl. Gradually whisk in oil. Season vinaigrette to taste with salt and pepper. Place bread in large bowl. Pour in enough cold water (about 8 cups) to cover bread. Soak 5 minutes. Drain well; squeeze bread to remove as much liquid as possible. Coarsely crumble bread into same bowl. Add tomatoes, onion and basil. Toss with enough vinaigrette to coat. Season salad generously with salt and pepper. (Can be made 8 hours ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Let stand 1 hour at room temperature before serving.)

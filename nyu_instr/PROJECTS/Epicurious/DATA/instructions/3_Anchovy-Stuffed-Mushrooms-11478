In a small bowl stir together the minced mushroom stems, the bread crumbs, the Parmesan, the oil, the parsley, the vinegar, the anchovy paste, and salt and pepper to taste until the stuffing is combined well. Arrange the mushroom caps, stemmed sides up, on a baking sheet, with a teaspoon fill the cavities with the stuffing, mounding it slightly, and bake the mushrooms in the middle of a preheated 350°F. oven for 15 minutes. Garnish each mushroom with a parsley leaf.

Prepare frying oil: Heat 2 inches oil in a 4-quart Dutch oven or a wide 4-inch-deep heavy pot over high heat until a deep-fat thermometer registers 400°F (oil will be just beginning to smoke). Drop in citrus peel (oil will bubble vigorously) and leave in oil until browned, about 1 minute. Remove with tongs.
Prepare dough: While oil is heating, bring water with salt to a boil, covered, in a 1 1/2- to 2-quart heavy saucepan. Add 2 teaspoons olive oil and remove from heat. Immediately add flour and stir vigorously with a wooden spoon until flour and water are combined well (mixture will be stiff and not very smooth). Fill churrera with some hot dough and wrap a kitchen towel around churrera canister to protect your hands.
Make churros: Turn screw handle of churrera until dough emerges from star opening. Holding opening about 2 inches above oil, turn handle to squeeze dough into oil in a continuous stream, making a spiral shape. (Spirals take practice; have a helper coax dough into a spiral in oil with a chopstick, keeping dough away from side of pot. For beginners, small coils or any kind of curvy shape is fine.) Stop when dough stream breaks naturally or pot is full.
Cook until underside is golden, about 1 1/2 minutes, and turn over with chopsticks. Then cook until golden, about 1 1/2 minutes more. Transfer churro with chopsticks to paper towels to drain and sprinkle with sugar.
Make more churros in same manner, returning oil to 400°F between batches.
Break churros into pieces if desired and serve immediately.

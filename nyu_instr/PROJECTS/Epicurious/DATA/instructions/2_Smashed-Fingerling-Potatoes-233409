Place potatoes in large pot. Add enough water to pot to cover potatoes by 1 inch. Bring to boil; cook potatoes until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain and return potatoes to pot.
Add Béarnaise Butter to potatoes. Using potato masher, coarsely mash potatoes. Add 1/2 cup milk; stir to blend. Add more milk by tablespoonfuls as needed if dry. Season to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature. Rewarm before serving, adding more warm milk by tablespoonfuls as needed if dry.) Transfer to bowl, sprinkle with tarragon and parsley, and serve.

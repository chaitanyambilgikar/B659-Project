Stir Alfredo sauce, prosciutto and basil in small bowl to blend. Spread 2 tablespoons Alfredo sauce mixture in bottom of two 1 1/2-cup oval-shape gratin dishes or two 2-cup soufflé dishes. Top each with 1/4 cup tomatoes with juices. Place 1 noodle in each dish, breaking into pieces to fit. Spread each with 2 tablespoons sauce mixture, then 1/4 cup tomatoes with juices. Top each with 2/3 cup roasted vegetables. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Make another layer of noodles, breaking to fit. Top with remaining sauce mixture, dividing equally. Top each with 1/4 cup tomatoes with juices.
Cover dishes tightly with plastic wrap. Microwave on high until noodles are tender but still firm to bite, about 10 minutes. Uncover lasagna and let stand 5 minutes before serving

Preheat oven to 350°F..
In a shallow baking pan spread bacon in one layer and sprinkle generously with additional pepper. Bake bacon in oven, stirring occasionally, 15 to 20 minutes, or until crisp, and transfer with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain, reserving drippings.
In a small heavy saucepan boil wine with shallot until most wine is evaporated and add cream, mustard, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, and salt to taste. Simmer mixture until thickened slightly and keep warm.
In a very large skillet heat half of reserved drippings over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and cook half of cabbage, stirring, until it begins to wilt, about 2 minutes. Transfer wilted cabbage to a bowl and cook remaining cabbage in remaining reserved drippings in same manner. Return wilted cabbage in bowl to skillet. Add vinegar and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Stir in cream mixture and cook stirring until cabbage is crisp-tender. Add Roquefort, stirring until melted.

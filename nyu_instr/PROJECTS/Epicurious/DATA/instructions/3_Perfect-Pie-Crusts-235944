In a food processor using on/off turns, blend 1 1/2 cups instant flour, 1/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup shortening, and 1/4 teaspoon salt until mixture is crumbly and pieces of butter and shortening are the size of small peas. Add 1/4 cup ice water and mix in using on/off turns until dough forms large moist clumps.
Flatten dough into 7-inch round, enclose in plastic, and place in refrigerator 30 minutes. Repeat process with remaining ingredients to make second pie crust.

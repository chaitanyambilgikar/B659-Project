Spray grill rack with nonstick spray and prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Whisk juice concentrate, hoisin, chili powder, oil, and orange peel in medium bowl; season sauce with salt and pepper.
Place beef in large bowl. Sprinkle with salt and pepper; toss to coat. Add 1/4 cup sauce; toss well. Let stand 5 minutes. Cut each orange slice into 6 wedges. Alternate 5 beef cubes and 4 orange wedges on each of 4 metal skewers.
Grill kebabs to desired doneness, brushing with more sauce and turning occasionally, about 10 minutes for medium-rare.
Place 1 skewer on each of 4 plates; sprinkle with green onions. Serve kebabs with remaining sauce.

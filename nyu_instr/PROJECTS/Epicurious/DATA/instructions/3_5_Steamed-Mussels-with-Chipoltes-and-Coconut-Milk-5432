Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium heat. Add onion, carrot and celery and sauté until onion is tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in coconut milk, stock, wine and garlic; boil over medium-high heat until reduced to 2 cups, about 15 minutes. Stir in mint, cilantro and chilies. Add mussels; cover and cook until mussels open, about 5 minutes (discard any mussels that do not open). Transfer mussels and broth to large bowl and serve.

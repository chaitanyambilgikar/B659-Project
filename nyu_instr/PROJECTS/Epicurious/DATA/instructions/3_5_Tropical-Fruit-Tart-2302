Preheat oven to 425°F. Unfold crust.
Using wet fingertips, press together any cracks to seal. Rub crust with flour. Place crust, floured side down, in 9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom. Fold overhang in; press firmly, forming double-thick sides. Pierce bottom of crust with fork. Bake until golden, about 14 minutes. Cool completely.
Beat cream cheese and sugar in large bowl until smooth. Beat in whipping cream, lemon juice and vanilla. Spread filling in prepared crust. Refrigerate until filling is firm, about 1 hour.
Arrange pineapple, kiwis and mango atop tart. Stir preserves in saucepan over low heat until melted. Brush preserves over fruit. Chill tart up to 2 hours.

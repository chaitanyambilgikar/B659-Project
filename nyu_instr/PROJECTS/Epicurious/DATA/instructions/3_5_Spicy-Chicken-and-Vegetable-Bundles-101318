Combine first six ingredients on medium bowl. Set sauce aside.
Bring broth to boil in large saucepan. Working in batches, add cabbage leaves. Cover and simmer until leaves are wilted, about 2 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer leaves to bowl of cold water. Drain leaves; pat dry. Add beans to broth in pan; until tender, about 2 minutes. Using slotted spoon, add beans to sauce. Pour off all but 1/4 cup liquid from saucepan. Add chicken; stir over medium heat until cooked through, breaking up meat with spoon, about 3 minutes. Drain chicken; add to sauce. Season with salt. Cool. (Can be made 3 hours ahead. Cover chicken mixture and cabbage seperately; chill. Bring to room temperature before continuing.)
Place 1 cabbage leaf on work surface. Mound scant 1/4 cup chicken mixture in center of leaf. Fold in 3 sides of leaf; roll up to form bundle. Reapeat with remaining 11 cabbage leaves and chicken mixture.

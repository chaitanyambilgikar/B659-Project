For crust: Blend flour, sugar, and salt in processor 5 seconds. Add butter. Using on/off turns, cut in until very coarse meal forms. Add 3 tablespoons ice water. Blend until moist clumps form, adding more ice water by teaspoonfuls if dough is dry. Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk. Wrap in plastic wrap; chill 1 hour. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Keep chilled.Soften briefly at room temperature before rolling.
Preheat oven to 375°F. Roll out dough on floured surface to 12- to 13-inch round. Transfer dough to 9-inch tart pan with removable bottom. Cut off all but 1/2 inch of overhang and fold in, pressing dough to come 1/4 to 1/3 inch higher than pan sides. Freeze crust until firm, about 10 minutes.
Line crust with foil and dried beans or pie weights. Bake crust until sides are set, about 25 minutes. Remove foil and beans. Continue to bake until crust is pale golden, piercing with fork if crust bubbles, 12 to 15 minutes longer. Cool on rack 30 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350°F.
For filling: Spread raspberry preserves evenly over bottom of crust. Scrape seeds from vanilla bean halves into medium bowl. Add sugar and blend with back of fork to distribute vanilla seeds evenly. Add butter, egg yolks, egg whites, almond extract, and salt; whisk to blend. Finely grind almonds in processor; stir into filling. Pour filling into crust.
Bake tart until browned on top and set in center, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool on rack until just slightly warm, about 45 minutes.
Push up tart pan bottom to release tart. Serve slightly warm or at room temperature with whipped cream.

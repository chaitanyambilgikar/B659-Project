Start with plenty of melted butter. Use a large grill for the filets, lobster tails and crab legs. The skewers of shrimp and scallops can broil right on the regular grill. Dip the filets in melted butter and then in sesame seeds. Brush the lobster tails and the crab legs well with butter. Clean the shrimp as for Broiled Shrimp Appetizer and alternate them on skewers with the scallops. Brush these well with butter.
The filets and lobster tails will take about 7-8 minutes, so start them first. Allow 5-6 minutes for the skewered shrimp and scallops and about 5 minutes for the crab legs. These only need to heat through. Brush everything liberally with butter during the cooking process, and sprinkle additional sesame seeds on the filets. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve on hot plates, with small bowls of melted butter, lemon wedges and dill sauce .

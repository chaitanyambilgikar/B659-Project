Heat a large dry cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add chiles; toast, turning often, until just fragrant, about 1 minute. Remove from pan and let cool.
Using kitchen scissors and working over a medium bowl, cut chiles into 1" rings, reserving seeds and discarding stems. Cover with 1/2 cup hot water; let soak, stirring occasionally, until chiles are soft and pliable, about 10 minutes.
Transfer chiles with seeds and soaking liquid to a blender. Add garlic, paprika, 1 tablespoon salt, and pepper; pulse until a paste forms.
Combine pork and chile paste in a large bowl. Gently mix until just blended (do not overwork the meat).
Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Working in 2 batches, cook chorizo until cooked through, 7-8 minutes. (Be sure to let meat brown before turning and breaking it up into small pieces with a spoon or spatula.) Season with salt. DO AHEAD: Chorizo can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Rewarm before serving.

Spray an 81/2 x 41/2-inch or 9 x 5-inch loaf pan with vegetable spray.
In the bowl of a heavy-duty mixer, add the flour blend, milk powder, brown sugar, and yeast and mix to combine. Mix together the water, eggs, and vegetable oil in a separate bowl. Add to the dry ingredients. Beat on low for 1 minute. Beat on medium-high speed for 3 minutes or until the mixture is smooth, shiny, and has thickened.
Scrape the dough into the prepared pan. Cover with lightly oiled plastic wrap and set in a warm, draft-free area until the dough rises to the top of the pan.
Preheat the oven to 375°F. Remove the plastic wrap and bake on the middle rack for 40 to 45 minutes, until the top sounds hollow when tapped and the internal temperature reads 190°to 200°F.
Remove and turn out onto a wire rack. Cool completely before slicing.
Bread Machine Preparation Combine the eggs, water, and vegetable oil and pour into the bread pan. Combine the flour blend and milk powder. Spoon over the wet ingredients. Sprinkle the yeast over the top. Follow the instructions of the machine for proper setting or pick a setting that allows for one knead and rise cycle and a 50 minute bake time.

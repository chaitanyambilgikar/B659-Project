Preheat oven to 450°F with a large shallow baking pan in upper third.
Mince and mash garlic to a paste with 1/2 teaspoon salt, then stir together with butter and parsley.
Plunge lobsters headfirst into a large pot of boiling salted water (3 tablespoons salt for 6 quarts water) and cook, covered, 3 minutes from time they enter water. Transfer with tongs to a plate and let stand 5 minutes. (Lobsters will not be fully cooked.)
Lightly crack claws, then split lobsters lengthwise and discard innards from body cavity.
Remove tail meat from 1 lobster and cut crosswise into 8 pieces. Spread about 2 tablespoons garlic butter in one empty half shell, then fill that shell with all of sliced lobster and dot with 1 tablespoon garlic butter. Spoon about 5 tablespoons garlic butter into other empty half shell (for dipping). Repeat with remaining lobster.

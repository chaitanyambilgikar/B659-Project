Heat heavy small skillet over medium heat. Add coriander; stir about 2 minutes. Transfer coriander to blender and blend until coarsely ground. Add breadcrumbs, pepitas and salt to blender; pulse until pepitas are coarsely chopped. Transfer mixture to baking sheet.
Place flour in pie dish. Whisk eggs to blend in medium bowl. Sprinkle fish with pepper. Dip both sides of each fish fillet into flour; shake off excess. Dip fish into eggs, then into breadcrumb mixture, coating completely.
Melt 2 tablespoons butter with 1 tablespoon oil in each of 2 heavy large skillets over medium-high heat. Add 2 fish fillets to each skillet and cook just until fish is opaque in center and coating is golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Serve fish with lemon wedges.

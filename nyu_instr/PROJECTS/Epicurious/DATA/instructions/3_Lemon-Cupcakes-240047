1. Preheat oven to 325°F. Line a 12-hole muffin tin with 12 paper cupcake cases. Prepare the cake batter according to the package directions.
2. Fill each cupcake case with batter up to just below the rim of the paper. Cover and refrigerate the remaining cake batter. Bake the cupcakes until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean, about 25 to 35 minutes. Remove and let cool in the tin for 10 minutes, then lift the cakes out of the tray and place on a cake rack to cool completely.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 with the remaining cake batter.
4. Meanwhile, using an electric mixer, beat the butter with 4 tablespoons of the lemon curd until smooth. Gradually add the sugar and continue beating until the mixture becomes a thick, creamy, spreadable frosting. Add more lemon curd to taste, if desired. If the frosting becomes too thick, gradually add the milk, beating between each addition, until the desired consistency is achieved.
5. Slice the top from each cupcake, cutting just above the rim of the paper case. Scoop out about 1 teaspoon of cake crumbs from the center of each cupcake and replace them with 11/2teaspoons of lemon curd. Place the top back on each cupcake, sticking it back together with the lemon curd. Spread the top of each cupcake with some frosting and dust with the colored sugars. Allow the frosting to set for at least 20 minutes before serving.

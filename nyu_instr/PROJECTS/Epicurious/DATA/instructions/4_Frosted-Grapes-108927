Hold one grape cluster by the stem and brush lightly with egg whites. Transfer to a rack set over wax paper, then sprinkle with sugar, using fingers, turning cluster to lightly coat. Gently shake off excess sugar. Repeat with remaining clusters. Let grapes dry, uncovered, at room temperature, about 2 hours.

Rub the butter on a slab of marble.
Pour the honey in a saucepan. Bring to a simmer, stirring constantly, and cook over a low heat for 10 minutes. Add the almonds and continue cooking for another 10 minutes, stirring constantly. The honey will begin to thicken and turn an amber color.
To test if the nougat is ready, drop a teaspoon of honey into a glass of cold water; it should harden immediately. Remove honey from the heat and stir for 2 more minutes. Carefully pour the honey mixture onto the buttered marble slab (it will still be very hot). Smooth the mixture with a metal spoon to spread the almonds evenly. When the nougat is completely cool, break it into 2 inch pieces with the back of a knife. Store in a cool place.

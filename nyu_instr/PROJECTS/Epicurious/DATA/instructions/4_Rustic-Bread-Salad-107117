1. Preheat the oven to 350°F.
2. Toss the bread cubes with 3 tablespoons of the olive oil, the salt, and pepper. Spread the bread cubes in a single layer on a baking sheet and bake until slightly toasted and golden, about 15 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally. Set aside.
3. Halve the cucumber lengthwise and cut into 1/2-inch pieces. Place in a large bowl along with the red pepper, celery, carrots, onion, tomatoes, basil, and mint. Season with salt and pepper. Add the bread cubes. Drizzle the salad with the remaining 4 tablespoons of olive oil and the vinegar. Toss the salad and garnish with the chopped eggs.

Heat olive oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add olives, chopped onion, chopped garlic and crushed red pepper and sauté until onion begins to soften, about 4 minutes. Add tomatoes and tomato paste and stir until tomatoes are just warmed through, about 2 minutes. Mix in red wine vinegar. Add cooked pasta, 1 cup Parmesan cheese and fresh basil and toss to combine. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer to large bowl. Serve with remaining Parmesan cheese.

In a blender purée the parsley with the oil. In a large steamer set over boiling water steam the cauliflower, covered, for 5 minutes, or until it is just tender. While the cauliflower is steaming, in a kettle of boiling salted water boil the pasta until it is al dente and drain it well. In a large bowl toss the pasta with the parsley sauce, the cauliflower, the olives, and salt and pepper to taste.

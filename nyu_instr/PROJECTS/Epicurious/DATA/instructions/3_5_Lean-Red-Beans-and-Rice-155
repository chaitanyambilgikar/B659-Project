Soak beans in water to cover overnight.
Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium heat. Add onion and garlic and sauté until tender, about 6 minutes. Stir in pork chops, sausage, thyme and cayenne; sauté 2 minutes. Add beans and 3 1/2 cups water. Simmer over low heat until beans are creamy, about 1 1/2 hours. Serve with steamed rice.

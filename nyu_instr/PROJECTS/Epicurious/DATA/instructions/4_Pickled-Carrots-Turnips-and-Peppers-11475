In a saucepan bring the vinegars and the water to a boil with the sugar, the gingerroot, the garlic, the dill seeds, the celery seeds, the salt, the mustard, and the peppercorns and simmer the mixture, stirring occasionally, for 3 minutes, or until the sugar is dissolved. Put the carrots, the turnips, and the bell peppers in a heatproof container, pour the vinegar mixture over them, covering them completely, and chill the vegetables, covered, overnight. The vegetables keep, covered and chilled, for 1 week.

Preheat oven to 350°F.
In a bowl stir together crumbs, butter, and 2 tablespoons sugar and reserve about one-fourth mixture. Press remaining mixture onto bottom of flameproof 8-inch-square baking pan. Bake crust 12 minutes, or until golden, and cool in pan on a rack. In a bowl stir together ice cream and peanuts and spread on crust. Sprinkle reserved crumb mixture evenly on top, pressing lightly. Freeze ice-cream mixture, covered with foil, overnight.
Preheat broiler.
In metal bowl combine egg whites and remaining 1/3 cup sugar and set over a pan of simmering water. Stir mixture just until sugar is dissolved. Remove bowl from heat and with an electric mixer beat meringue until it holds stiff glossy peaks.
Spread meringue over ice cream and broil under preheated broiler about 4 inches from heat until golden, about 30 seconds. Freeze dessert, uncovered, 30 minutes to harden meringue and if desired freeze, covered, overnight.
Cut dessert into 4 squares and halve each square diagonally into triangles.

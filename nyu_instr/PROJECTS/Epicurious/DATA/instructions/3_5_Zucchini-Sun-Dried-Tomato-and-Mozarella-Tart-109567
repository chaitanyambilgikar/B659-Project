Roll out pastry on floured surface to 1/8-inch-thick square. Trim pastry edges to form 13-inch round. Transfer to 11-inch tart pan with removable bottom. Fold in overhang to form double-thick sides. Pierce with fork. Cover; chill 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 425°F. Line pastry with foil; fill with beans or pie weights. Bake pastry until sides are set, about 20 minutes. Remove foil and beans. Bake crust until bottom is golden brown, pressing with back of fork if bubbles form, about 8 minutes. Cool 5 minutes.
Reduce oven temperature to 400°F. Sprinkle mozzarella over bottom of crust. Top with 6 tablespoons Parmesan, tomatoes, basil, green onions, and oregano. Arrange zucchini rounds in concentric circles to cover top of tart. Whisk eggs, half and half, salt, and pepper in medium bowl. Pour mixture into tart. Sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan.
Bake tart until custard is set and crust is golden brown, about 35 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.

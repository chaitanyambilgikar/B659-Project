Halve the eggs lengthwise and transfer the yolks to a mixing bowl. Set the egg white halves on a platter, cover, and refrigerate.
With a fork, mash the yolks to a smooth consistency. Add the mayonnaise, mustard, garlic, and pesto, and mix until smooth. (You can also do this using an electric mixer with a whip attachment.) Stir in the green onion. Taste the egg mixture and add a little salt if needed; pestos differ in salt content.
Spoon the mixture into a pastry bag fitted with a plain or large star tip, then pipe the mixture evenly into the egg white halves. Or fill the eggs with a spoon, dividing the filling evenly.
To make the topping, in a small bowl, mix together the prosciutto and basil. Drizzle with the oil and toss to coat. Top each egg half with about 1 heaping teaspoon of the mixture.

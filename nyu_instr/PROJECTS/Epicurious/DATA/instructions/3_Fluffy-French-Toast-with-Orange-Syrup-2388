Generously butter large roasting pan. Arrange bread in single layer in prepared pan, fitting closely together. Beat half and half, eggs, cinnamon and nutmeg to blend in medium bowl. Pour egg mixture over bread. Cover pan and refrigerate until bread absorbs mixture, turning once, about 3 hours. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Keep refrigerated.)
Preheat oven to 400°F. Uncover pan and bake French toast until tester inserted into center of bread comes out clean, about 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, stir orange juice and cornstarch in small saucepan until smooth. Add sugar and stir over medium heat until thick, about 8 minutes. Add butter, lemon juice and orange peel and stir until butter melts.
Recut French toast into 8 separate slices. Serve with warm orange syrup.

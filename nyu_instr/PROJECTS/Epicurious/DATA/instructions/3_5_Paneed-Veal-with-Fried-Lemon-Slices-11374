In a shallow baking dish whisk together eggs and water and in a large shallow baking dish stir together bread crumbs, zest, thyme, and salt and pepper to taste. Dip cutlets, 1 at a time, into egg mixture, letting excess drip off, and dredge in bread crumb mixture, pressing lightly until mixture adheres. Transfer cutlets as coated to a large rack and let dry at room temperature at least 15 minutes and up to 30 minutes. Veal may be prepared up to this point 1 hour ahead and chilled, uncovered.
Preheat oven to 225°F.
In a deep heavy skillet (preferably cast-iron) heat 1 inch oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking. While oil is heating, dredge 4 lemon slices in flour, knocking off excess. Fry lemon slices, turning them occasionally, until golden, about 45 seconds. Transfer slices as fried with tongs to paper towels to drain briefly and arrange in one layer on another large rack set on a baking sheet. Coat and fry remaining 12 lemon slices in batches in same manner. (Carefully remove skillet from heat if necessary while coating slices to prevent oil from overheating.) Keep lemon slices, arranged in one layer, warm on baking sheet in oven.
Remove any food particles in oil remaining in skillet with a slotted spoon and discard. Heat oil if necessary until hot but not smoking and fry cutlets, 1 at a time, turning them once, until golden and just cooked through, about 45 seconds, transferring with tongs to paper towels to drain briefly. Transfer veal to cleaned rack set on another baking sheet and keep warm in oven.

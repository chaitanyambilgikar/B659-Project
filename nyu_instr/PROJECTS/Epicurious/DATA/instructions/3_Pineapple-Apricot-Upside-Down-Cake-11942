In a buttered 9- by 1 1/2-inch round cake pan combine well the butter and the brown sugar and press the mixture evenly onto the bottom of the pan. Cut the pineapple rings in half and arrange them, patted with paper towels, and the whole apricots, smooth sides down, decoratively on the sugar mixture.
Into a small bowl sift together the flour, the baking powder, and the salt. In a bowl with an electric mixer beat the shortening and the granulated sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy and beat in the egg and the vanilla. Add the flour mixture alternately with 1/3 cup water, beating after each addition, and stir in the chopped pineapple, patted dry, and the chopped apricots. Turn the batter into the pan, spreading it evenly, and bake the cake in the middle of a preheated 350°F. oven for 40 to 45 minutes, or until a tester comes out clean. Let the cake cool in the pan for 5 minutes, invert it onto a serving plate, and serve it warm or at room temperature with the whipped cream.

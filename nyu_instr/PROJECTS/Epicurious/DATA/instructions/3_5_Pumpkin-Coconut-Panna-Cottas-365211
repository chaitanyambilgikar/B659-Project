Sprinkle gelatin over water in a very small saucepan and let stand 1 minute to soften. Heat over medium heat, stirring, until gelatin is dissolved, then remove from heat.
Pulse coconut milk, cream, pumpkin, sugar, and a pinch of salt in a blender to combine, then add gelatin mixture and blend until smooth. Strain mixture through a fine sieve into a bowl with a spout or transfer to a 4-quart measuring cup.
Pour mixture into bowls and chill, covered, until firm, at least 6 hours.
Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350°F with rack in middle. Spread coconut on a rimmed sheet pan and stirring once or twice bake until golden, 8 to 10 minutes, and cool.
Just before serving, sprinkle desserts with coconut and drizzle with honey.

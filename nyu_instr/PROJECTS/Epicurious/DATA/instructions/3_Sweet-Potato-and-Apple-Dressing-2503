Preheat oven to 375°F. Butter 4-cup casserole. Cook potato in small pot of boiling salted water until just tender, about 5 minutes. Drain and set aside.
Heat oil in heavy medium skillet over medium heat. Add onion, apple and celery and sauté until onion is translucent, abut 5 minutes. Add potato and sauté 1 minute. Add stuffing mix, sage and broth. Cover skillet, reduce heat to medium-low and cook until stock is absorbed, about 10 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer dressing to prepared dish. (Can be prepared 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.) Cover with foil and bake until heated through, about 30 minutes. Uncover and bake until top begins to brown, about 15 minutes.

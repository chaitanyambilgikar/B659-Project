Preheat oven to 375°F. Cut top 1/2" off head of garlic; place on sheet of foil and drizzle with 1/2 tablespoon oil. Roast garlic until tender, about 50 minutes. Let cool; squeeze cloves from skins and set aside. Discard skins.
Meanwhile, heat 1/2 tablespoon oil in a large heavy pot over medium heat. Add onion and next 5 ingredients; season with salt and pepper. Cook until vegetables are soft, about 5 minutes. Add lentils; stir for 2 minutes. Add wine; simmer until almost all liquid is evaporated, 4-5 minutes. Pour in broth to cover lentils by 1". Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and gently simmer, adding more broth or water by 1/4-cupfuls as needed, until lentils are tender, about 30 minutes. Let cool slightly; discard herbs.
Pureée lentil mixture and garlic cloves in a food processor. Stir in remaining 1/2 cup oil and 2 tablespoons lemon juice. Season with salt, pepper, and more lemon juice, if desired.

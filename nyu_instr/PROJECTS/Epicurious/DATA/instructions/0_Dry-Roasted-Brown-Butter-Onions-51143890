Preheat oven to 400°F. Cut white onions, larger cipolline onions, and shallots almost in half, leaving root ends intact. Pry each open slightly to expose cut sides. Place white onions root side down in a foil-lined roasting pan and roast until just beginning to soften and brown, 75-90 minutes.
Add cipolline onions and shallots to roasting pan root end down and roast until all onions and shallots are soft and deeply colored, about 1 hour longer.
Just before onions finish cooking, melt butter in a small saucepan and cook, swirling occasionally, until butter is brown and smells nutty, 5-8 minutes. Let cool slightly; whisk in vinegar and season brown butter with salt.
Divide onions and shallots among plates, leaving skins on; spoon brown butter over.

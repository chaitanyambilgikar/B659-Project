Preheat oven to 350°F. Spray large cookie sheet with cooking spray or brush lightly with vegetable oil.
In large bowl using an electric mixer, beat together butter and sugar on high speed until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add vanilla and beat briefly to incorporate.
In medium bowl, whisk together flour, cocoa, baking powder, and salt. Add to butter mixture and beat on low speed just until incorporated, kneading by hand at the end. Add cherries and beat on low speed just until incorporated.
Turn dough onto work surface and if necessary, knead briefly to incorporate any loose cherries. Divide in half and roll each half into 8-inch-long (approximately 1 1/2-inch-wide) log.
Carefully transfer logs to prepared baking sheet and bake until tops are firm to touch and bottoms are light golden, about 25 minutes. Cool on baking sheet on rack 1 hour. Reduce oven temperature to 250° F. Using serrated knife, cut logs on a slight diagonal into 12 (1 1/2-inch-thick) slices. Return biscotti to baking sheet, cut-sides down. Bake, turning over once, until dry and crisp, about 45 minutes. Transfer to rack and cool completely.

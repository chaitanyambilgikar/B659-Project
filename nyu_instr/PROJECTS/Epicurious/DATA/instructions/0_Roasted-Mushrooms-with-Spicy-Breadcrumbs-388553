Preheat oven to 450°F with rack in middle.
For white button or cremini mushrooms, halve lengthwise. For larger mushrooms such as portabella or king trumpets, cut lengthwise into 1/2-inch slices. For oyster mushrooms, tear into small clumps.
Place mushrooms in a small roasting pan or rimmed sheet pan and toss with 2 tablespoons of the oil, garlic, 1/8 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper. Top with 1 tablespoon of the butter, cut into pieces, and roast in oven, stirring occasionally, until golden and cooked through, about 15-20 minutes.
Meanwhile, melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter with remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add breadcrumbs and cook, stirring frequently, 2 minutes. Add thyme and red pepper flakes and cook (there may be some popping), stirring frequently, until breadcrumbs are golden and crisp, about 2 minutes more. Remove from heat and stir in parsley.
To serve, transfer hot roasted mushrooms to a platter and sprinkle with crumbs.

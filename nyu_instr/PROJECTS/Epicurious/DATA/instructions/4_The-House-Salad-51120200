To make the dressing, whisk together the crème fraîche, olive oil, and honey. Add the scallion, vinegar, salt, and pepper and whisk again. Taste and add salt and pepper to taste, or a touch more vinegar if you prefer your dressing on the acidic side.
Gently pull the lettuce leaves from the head, making sure they are dry. Gently toss the leaves and jicama with the dressing. Assemble in a stack on each of 4 plates, starting with the largest leaves on the bottom to create a base. Garnish each salad with a quarter of the pomegranate seeds and the cheese shavings. Serve immediately.

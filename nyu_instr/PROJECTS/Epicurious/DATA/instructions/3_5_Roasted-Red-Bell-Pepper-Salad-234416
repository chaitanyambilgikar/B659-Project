Char peppers over open flame or in broiler until blackened on all sides. Transfer to large bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and cool. Peel and seed peppers. Cut into 1/2-inch-wide strips.
Place peppers in medium bowl. Add all remaining ingredients and toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate overnight. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Keep refrigerated.) Return to room temperature before serving.

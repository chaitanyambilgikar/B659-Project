In a large bowl whisk together shallots, vinegar, oil, and salt and pepper to taste.(Vinaigrette may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.)
In a large saucepan of boiling salted water cook snap peas until crisp-tender, about 2 minutes. Drain snap peas in a colander and transfer to a bowl of ice water to stop cooking. Drain snap peas well.(Snap peas may be prepared up to this point 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.)
Add snap peas to vinaigrette with basil and parsley, tossing to combine well. Line a platter or salad bowl with lettuce and mound with salad.

Preheat oven to 475°F.
Blanch onions in a large pot of boiling water 1 minute, then drain. Trim and peel.
Tightly wrap onions and beets in double layers of foil to make 5 packages (2 of onions and 3 of beets) and roast until tender, 30 to 40 minutes for onions and about 1 hour for beets.
When beets and onions are cool enough to handle, discard foil. Slip off skins and stems from beets and cut into wedges.

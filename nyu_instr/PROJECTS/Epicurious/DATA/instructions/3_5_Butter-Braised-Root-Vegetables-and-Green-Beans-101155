With a sharp knife peel celery root and cut into 1-inch pieces. Diagonally cut carrots into 1-inch-thick pieces. Quarter shallots lengthwise. In a 2-quart heavy saucepan melt butter over moderately low heat. Add celery root, carrots, shallots, salt, and pepper to taste, stirring to coat vegetables with butter, and cook, covered, stirring occasionally, 20 minutes. While root vegetables are cooking, trim beans. Stir beans into root vegetables and cook, covered, stirring once or twice, until all vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes.

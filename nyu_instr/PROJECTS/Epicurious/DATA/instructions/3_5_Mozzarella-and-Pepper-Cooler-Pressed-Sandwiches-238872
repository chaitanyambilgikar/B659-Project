1. In a medium bowl, combine the first four ingredients (including the bocconcini's or mozzarella's marinade).
2. Fill the baguette with the mixture.
3. Close the baguette and wrap it tightly in waxed paper, then in aluminum foil.
4. Place the sandwich at the bottom of the cooler so the weight of the other contents compresses the sandwich and allows the juices to soak into the bread.

Combine paprika, salt, sugar, brown sugar, cumin, chile powder, black pepper, cayenne, onion powder, garlic powder, celery salt, and oregano in bowl; mix well. For a smoother rub, puree ingredients in a spice grinder until well combined and all pieces are uniform (the rub will be very fine and tan in color).
Extra rub can be stored in an airtight container for up to six months.

Prepare a gas grill for direct-heat cooking over medium-high heat.
Stir together 2 teaspoons garlic, 1 1/2 teaspoons ginger, 1 tablespoon vinegar, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a small bowl. Pat steaks dry and rub marinade all over them. Marinate 5 to 15 minutes.
Brush steaks with 1 tablespoon oil, then oil grill rack and grill steaks, covered, turning over once, about 10 minutes total for medium-rare. Transfer steaks to a cutting board and let stand 5 minutes.
While steaks cook, add noodles to a pasta pot of boiling salted water (1 tablespoon salt for 4 quarts water) and, when noodles rise to top, reduce heat, then simmer until just tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Add sugar snaps and cook 1 minute more. Drain in a colander and rinse briefly under cold water. Divide noodles and sugar snaps among 4 large bowls.
Bring broth to a boil in a small saucepan with remaining 2 tablespoons vinegar, 1 tablespoon oil, 2 teaspoons garlic, and 1 1/2 teaspoons ginger, then stir in fish sauce and scallions and pour over noodles.
Thinly slice steaks across grain and divide among bowls, then top with mint or cilantro.

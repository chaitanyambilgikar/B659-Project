Reduce heat to medium; cook until vegetables are very tender when pierced with sharp knife, about 20 minutes. Drain well. Return vegetables to pan and place over medium heat, stirring constantly until moisture evaporates, 2 to 3 minutes.

Season with coarse salt and black pepper. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 hour ahead. Rewarm in microwave until heated through.

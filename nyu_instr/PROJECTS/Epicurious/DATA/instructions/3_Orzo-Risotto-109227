Cook orzo in a large pot of boiling salted water until barely al dente, 5 to 6 minutes. Drain in a colander and rinse under cold water to stop cooking.
Transfer orzo to a 2-quart heavy saucepan and add stock, zest, and thyme. Simmer over moderate heat, stirring constantly, until stock is absorbed, about 5 minutes.
Stir in cheese, butter, salt, and pepper and serve immediately.

Make chickpea mixture: Boil chickpeas in water to cover by 1 inch in a 2-quart saucepan, covered, 2 minutes. Remove from heat and let chickpeas stand, covered, 1 hour. Drain chickpeas in a sieve and return to pan. Simmer in water to cover by 4 inches until tender, about 1 1/4 hours. Drain chickpeas in a sieve set over a bowl and reserve cooking liquid and 1/2 cup chickpeas separately.
Cook onion in 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until softened. Add scallions and oregano and cook, stirring occasionally, until scallions are softened. Purée remaining drained chickpeas, onion mixture, cornstarch, and 1/2 cup reserved cooking liquid in a food processor. (Mixture should be consistency of stiff mashed potatoes; if too stiff, add more cooking liquid.)
Roughly mash reserved 1/2 cup whole chickpeas in a bowl and stir in purée and mint with a fork. Season well with salt and pepper.
Fry rolls: Form 2-tablespoon mounds of chickpea mixture into balls, then form balls into 2- to 3-inch lengths. Dredge in flour, shaking off excess.
Heat enough safflower and olive oils to measure 3/4 inch in a deep 12-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat until a deep-fat thermometer registers 350°F. Fry rolls in batches of 5, turning them, until golden brown, about 1 minute.
Transfer with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain and return oil to 350°F between batches.

Bring carrots, butter, 1/2 teaspoon salt, peppercorns, bay leaf, and 1/2 cup water to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Reduce heat to a simmer, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, until just tender, 7–8 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer carrots to a medium bowl.
Add clementine juice, 1 tablespoon Sherry, and ground cloves to skillet and cook until glaze forms, 7-8 minutes. Stir in carrots and remaining 1 tablespoon Sherry. Season carrots to taste with salt. DO AHEAD: Can be made 4 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature. Rewarm over medium heat before continuing, adding water by teaspoonfuls if dry.
Transfer to a serving plate. Garnish with tarragon and clementine zest.

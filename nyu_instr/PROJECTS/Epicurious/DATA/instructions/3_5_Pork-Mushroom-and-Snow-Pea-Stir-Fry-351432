Toss pork with cornstarch and 1 teaspoon salt.
Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a wok or 12-inch heavy skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Stir-fry pork until pale golden and almost cooked through, about 4 minutes, then transfer to a plate. Add 1 tablespoon oil to wok and stir-fry snow peas with garlic until crisp-tender, about 1 minute. Transfer to plate.
Add mushrooms to wok with water and remaining tablespoon oil and cook, covered, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add pork, snow peas, and teriyaki sauce and stir-fry until pork is cooked through, about 2 minutes.

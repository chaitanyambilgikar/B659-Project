Preheat oven to 375°F. Butter 9-inch square baking pan. Sift flour, cornmeal, baking powder, salt and baking soda into medium bowl. Whisk buttermilk, butter and eggs in large bowl to blend. Add dry ingredients and stir just until blended. Pour batter into prepared pan.
Bake until golden brown around edges and tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool in pan on rack. (Can be made ahead. Cover and let stand at room temperature up to 2 days or freeze up to 2 weeks.)

Rinse the wheat berries, discarding any chaff. Soak in hot water to cover by 3/4 inch (2 cm) for 24 hours, changing the water twice.
Drain and rinse the berries. Put them in a heavy saucepan with enough fresh water to cover by at least 2 inches. Add the bay leaf, orange zest, and 1 teaspoon salt and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat, cover, and simmer until the grains are separate and tender, like rice, neither mushy nor al dente, 30 to 45 minutes. Check frequently after 30 minutes. Drain, discarding the bay leaf and zest. Let wheat berries cool thoroughly.
Peel, seed, and roughly chop the tomatoes. Place in a colander. Sprinkle with salt and sugar, and let stand for at least 20 minutes.
Put the tuna in a serving bowl and flake it. Add the capers, onion, garlic, hot pepper, salt to taste, and the lemon juice. Add the tomatoes and toss thoroughly. Stir in the olive oil; add the wheat berries and half of the herbs. Let stand for several hours, if possible.
Just before serving, sprinkle the remaining 1/4 cup herbs on top. The salad will keep well for a few days.

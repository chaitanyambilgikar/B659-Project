1. Preheat the oven to 300°F. Place the ribs in the center of an 18 × 24-inch sheet of heavy-duty foil. Bring up the sides of the foil, and double-fold one end to seal. Through the open end, add 1/4 cup of water. Double-fold the remaining foil, leaving enough room for heat to circulate. Transfer the ribs to a large, rimmed baking sheet. Bake until the ribs are tender, about one hour. Cool in the sealed packet for 30 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, oil the grill rack and prepare for a medium-hot fire. To make spice rub, combine all the ingredients in a cup.
3. Carefully open the packet, allowing the steam to escape. Transfer the ribs to another large, rimmed baking sheet; brush both sides with the mustard, then sprinkle with the spice rub and ground black pepper.
4. Place the ribs, meaty side down, on the grill rack. Cover and grill 15 minutes. Turn the ribs and brush with about one-third of the barbecue sauce; cover and grill 10 to 15 minutes. Turn the ribs and repeat. Brush the meaty side of the ribs with the remaining sauce, cover and grill until evenly charred, about five minutes. Drizzle the ribs with the honey and grill, uncovered, just until the honey sets, about five minutes longer.

1. In a large bowl, whisk together the red wine and salt, then whisk in the olive oil. Add the garlic and whisk.
2. Steam the potatoes until they are tender through, about 20 minutes. Remove them from the steamer and when they are cool enough to handle, peel them and cut them into thick rounds. Transfer them to the vinaigrette, toss, and let sit until the potatoes are cool through.
3. Add the remaining ingredients and toss. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and toss again. Let sit for at least two hours before serving.

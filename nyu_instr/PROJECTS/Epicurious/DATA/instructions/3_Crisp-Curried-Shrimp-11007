In a bowl stir together flour, curry powder, cayenne, and salt to taste. Add shrimp to flour mixture, tossing to coat.
In a large heavy skillet heat oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and sauté scallions until well browned and almost tender.
Add shrimp to scallions and sauté, stirring occasionally, about 4 minutes, or until shrimp are opaque throughout.
Serve shrimp with lemon.

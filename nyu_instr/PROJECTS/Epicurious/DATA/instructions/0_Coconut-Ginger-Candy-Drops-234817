Spray large rimmed baking sheet with nonstick spray. Combine coconut and all remaining ingredients in heavy medium saucepan. Stir mixture over medium heat until sugar dissolves and mixture comes to boil. Attach candy thermometer to side of pan. Boil until mixture thickens and temperature registers 295°F, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes. Remove pan from heat. Working quickly, drop about 2 tablespoons mixture for each coconut candy onto prepared baking sheet, spacing apart. Let stand until cool and firm. (Candy drops can be prepared 3 days ahead. Store airtight in single layer at room temperature.)

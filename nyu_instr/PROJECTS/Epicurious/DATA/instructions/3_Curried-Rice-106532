Cook onion and garlic in oil in a 3- to 4-quart heavy saucepan over moderately low heat, stirring, until softened. Add curry powder and rice and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add water and salt and boil, uncovered, without stirring, until surface of rice is covered with steam holes and grains on top appear dry, about 8 minutes.
Reduce heat to as low as possible, then cover pan with a tight-fitting lid and cook 15 minutes more.
Remove pan from heat and let rice stand, covered, 5 minutes, then fluff with a fork.

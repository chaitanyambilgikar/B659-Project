Blend 2/3 cup olive oil, oregano, lemon juice, garlic, lemon peel, and crushed red pepper in medium bowl; transfer 1/4 cup marinade to small bowl and reserve. Mix anchovies into remaining marinade. Let stand 2 hours at room temperature.
Preheat oven to 350°F. Brush bread slices on both sides with reserved marinade; arrange on baking sheet. Bake until toasts are golden, about 10 minutes.
Place greens in large bowl. Add balsamic vinegar and remaining 1/4 cup olive oil; toss to coat. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Divide greens among 4 plates. Top each salad with anchovies; garnish each with 3 toasts.

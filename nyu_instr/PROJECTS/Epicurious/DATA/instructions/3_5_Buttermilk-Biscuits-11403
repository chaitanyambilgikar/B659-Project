Preheat oven to 450°F.
In a large bowl whisk together flour, baking powder, salt, and baking soda until combined well. With a pastry blender or your fingertips blend in shortening and butter until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add buttermilk, stirring with a fork to form a soft dough, and with floured hands knead dough gently 4 times in bowl.
On a lightly floured surface pat dough out into a 1/2-inch-thick round. Cut out as many rounds as possible with a 2-inch round cutter dipped in flour and invert 1/2 inch apart onto a large baking sheet. Gather scraps into a ball. Pat out dough and cut out more rounds in same manner. Brush biscuits with egg wash and bake in middle of oven 12 minutes, or until golden. Cool biscuits on racks. Biscuits may be made 8 hours ahead and kept, wrapped well, at room temperature. Reheat biscuits, wrapped in foil, before serving.

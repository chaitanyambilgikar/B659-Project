Blend 1/4 cup garlic, 1 teaspoon salt, and 2 tablespoons oil in a blender on high speed until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes, then transfer to mortar. Add 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons oil very slowly, 1 to 2 teaspoons at a time, stirring and mashing constantly and vigorously with pestle. This will take about 15 minutes, and mixture will become very thick and glossy. (Aïoli will separate if oil is added too quickly.) Transfer to a bowl. Make second batch with remaining ingredients.

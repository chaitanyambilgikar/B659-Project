In a large bowl soak peas overnight in enough cold water to cover by 2 inches and drain.
In a 7 1/2-quart heavy kettle combine leeks, water, peas, ham hock, and thyme and simmer mixture, uncovered, until peas are very tender, about 30 minutes.
In a blender puree 4 cups soup in batches and return to kettle.
Peel celery root and cut into 1/4-inch dice. Add celery root to soup and simmer, stirring occasionally, 20 minutes. Add carrots and simmer, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 15 minutes.
Remove meat from ham hock and discard skin and bones. Chop meat coarse and stir into soup with salt and pepper to taste. Soup may be made 3 days in advance. Cool soup uncovered and keep covered and chilled. Thin soup with water if too thick.

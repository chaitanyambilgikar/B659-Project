Sauté onions in butter until just wilted. Roll meat cubes in seasoned flour and add to pan. Sauté the veal, turning to brown on all sides. When browned, add enough red wine to just cover the shallots, garlic, and basil. Cover and cook gently in a 325°F oven for 2 1/2 to 3 hours, or until veal is tender. Remove meat to a hot platter and pour sauce over it (you may return it to the top of the stove and stir in beurre manié if you want a thicker sauce). Garnish with chopped parsley and serve with boiled new potatoes and chopped cooked spinach flavored with garlic, olive oil, and lemon juice. With this, drink a fine red Beaujolais.

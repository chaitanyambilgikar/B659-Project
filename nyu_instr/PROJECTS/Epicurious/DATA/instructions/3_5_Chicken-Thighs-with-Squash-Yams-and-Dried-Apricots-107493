Mix cumin and thyme in small bowl. Sprinkle chicken with spice mixture, then salt and pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in large deep nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions; sauté until golden, about 5 minutes. Add garlic; stir 1 minute. Push onion mixture to side of skillet. Add remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil to skillet. Working in batches, add chicken and cook until beginning to brown, about 1 1/2 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to bowl after each batch. Return chicken to skillet. Scatter onion mixture, squash, yams, and apricots over chicken. Pour tomatoes with juices over; bring to boil. Stir in cardamom and cloves. Reduce heat to medium-low; cover and simmer until chicken and vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes. Uncover and simmer until juices are slightly reduced, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Serve.

Butter a baking dish large enough to hold 8 peach halves in a single layer.
Cut the peaches in half with a small knife and remove the pits. Cut off the peel in strips. Place the peach halves in the baking dish as you finish peeling them.
Use a melon baller to scoop out some of the center pulp from each peach, being careful not to perforate the edges, to make little containers for the filling.
Put the peach pulp on a cutting board and finely chop it; transfer it to a small bowl. Add the cookie crumbs, the egg yolk, and the cocoa powder, and stir to combine.
Preheat the oven to 350°F and center a rack in the oven. Divide the filling among the peach halves. Pour the wine into the dish around the peaches. Bake 30 to 35 minutes or until a thin crust forms on the filling. Let cool to room temperature or refrigerate until chilled. Serve with whipped cream, if you like.

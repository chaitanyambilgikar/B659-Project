Preheat oven to 400°F. Sprinkle chicken with sage, salt and pepper. Heat oil in medium oven-proof skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and sauté until brown, about 3 minutes per side.
Meanwhile, boil garlic cloves in small saucepan of water for 2 minutes; drain. Rinse under cold water to cool; peel.
Arrange garlic cloves around chicken in skillet. Pour wine over. Cover skillet; bake chicken and garlic 10 minutes. Uncover; baste chicken with pan juices. Bake chicken uncovered until cooked through, about 8 minutes longer. Using tongs, transfer chicken to plates.
Boil pan juices over high heat until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Spoon garlic sauce over chicken.

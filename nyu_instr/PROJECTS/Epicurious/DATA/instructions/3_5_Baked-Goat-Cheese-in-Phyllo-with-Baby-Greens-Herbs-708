Preheat oven to 375°F. Toss garlic with 1 tablespoon oil in small baking dish. Roast until garlic is very tender, about 20 minutes. Peel garlic. Transfer to small bowl. Mash to paste. Stir in goat cheese and basil. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Arrange 1 phyllo sheet so that 1 long side is parallel to edge of work surface. Brush half of phyllo crosswise with butter. Fold unbuttered half over as for book. Brush with melted butter. Sprinkle with 1 1/2 tablespoons breadcrumbs. Spoon 1/4 of goat cheese mixture along bottom edge of phyllo, leaving 1/2-inch border at bottom and on each side. Fold short sides in. Fold long edge over and roll up as for jelly roll. Place phyllo roll, seam side down, on heavy large baking sheet. Brush with butter. Repeat with remaining phyllo, butter, breadcrumbs and goat cheese mixture. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover tightly with plastic and refrigerate.)
Preheat oven to 400°F. Bake phyllo rolls until golden, about 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, whisk vinegar, shallot and remaining 1 cup oil in small bowl until well blended. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Mix tarragon, chives and parsley in small bowl. Place greens in large bowl.
Toss salad with enough dressing to season to taste. Divide among 6 plates. Using serrated knife, cut each phyllo roll diagonally into 2-inch slices. Arrange around edge of salads. Sprinkle herb mixture over salads.

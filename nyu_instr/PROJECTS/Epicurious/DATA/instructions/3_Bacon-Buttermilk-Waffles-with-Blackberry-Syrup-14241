Preheat a well-seasoned or non-stick Belgian or standard waffle iron. Preheat oven to 200° F. Finely chop bacon and in a skillet cook over moderate heat, stirring, until crisp. Into a large bowl sift together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt and stir in buttermilk, egg, and bacon including bacon fat (about 1/4 cup) until smooth (batter will be very thick).
Make syrup: Halve berries lengthwise. In a small saucepan simmer berries with syrup over moderately low heat 1 minute.
Spoon batter into waffle iron (using 1 cup batter for two 4-inch-square Belgian waffles or four 4-inch-square standard waffles), spreading evenly, and cook according to manufacturer's instructions. Transfer waffles to a baking sheet and keep warm, uncovered, in middle of oven. Make more waffles with remaining batter in same manner.
Serve waffles with blackberry syrup and garnish with blackberries.

Rinse tomatillos under warm water to remove stickiness and dry them. Quarter tomatillos and in a blender purée with jalapeño, coriander, and water until very smooth.
In a bowl stir together tomatillo mixture, onion, and salt. (Salsa may be made 10 hours ahead and chilled, covered. Bring salsa to room temperature before serving.)

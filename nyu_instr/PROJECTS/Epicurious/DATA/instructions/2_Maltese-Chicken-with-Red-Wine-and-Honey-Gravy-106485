Rinse chicken and pat dry. Heat oil in heavy large deep skillet over medium heat. Add chicken to skillet. Cover and cook until golden brown, about 15 minutes per side. Turn chicken skin side up; continue to cook uncovered until cooked through, about 10 minutes longer. Transfer chicken to platter; tent with foil to keep warm.
Pour off excess fat from skillet. Add wine and honey. Simmer until reduced to 1/3 cup, stirring often, about 8 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Pour sauce over chicken. Sprinkle with parsley.

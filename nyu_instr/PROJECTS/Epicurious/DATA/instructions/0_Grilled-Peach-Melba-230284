Preheat a grill or broiler. While grill is warming, zest limes and juice them (reserve zest and juice separately). Chop enough zest to make 1 tsp. Combine 2 pints raspberries with 1/4 cup sugar in a small saucepan. Cook over medium heat until berries start to release juices and break down. Puree in a blender, then pour through a fine-mesh strainer to remove seeds. Season to taste with lime juice and set aside. Toss together remaining raspberries, blueberries, and blackberries with remaining sugar, lime juice, and lime zest and set aside. Grill peaches and lime halves quickly, until they have grill marks and are warmed through, about 3 minutes per side. Remove from the grill.
To serve: Combine a peach half with 1/2 cup frozen yogurt in the bottom of a shallow dish. Spoon equal amounts of raspberry sauce on top of frozen yogurt and finish with equal amounts of raspberries, blueberries, and blackberries. Garnish with grilled lime.

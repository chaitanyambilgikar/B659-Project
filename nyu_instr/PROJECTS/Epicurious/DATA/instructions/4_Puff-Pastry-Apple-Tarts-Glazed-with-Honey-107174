Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Roll out pastry sheet on lightly floured surface to very thin 18x14-inch rectangle. Using small plate as guide, cut out four 7-inch rounds. Transfer 2 rounds to each prepared sheet; cover and refrigerate at least 30 minutes and up to 1 day.
Position 1 rack in top third and 1 rack in bottom third of oven and preheat to 400°F. Overlap slices from 1/2 apple on each pastry round, leaving 1/4-inch plain border. Sprinkle apple on each tart with 2 1/4 teaspoons sugar, then drizzle with 2 1/4 teaspoons butter.
Bake tarts until pastry is golden and apples are tender, about 25 minutes. Drizzle each tart with 1 teaspoon honey. Transfer tarts to racks; cool 10 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.

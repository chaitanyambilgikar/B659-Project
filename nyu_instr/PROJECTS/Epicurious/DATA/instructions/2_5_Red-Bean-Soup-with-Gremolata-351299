Quick-soak beans and make soup: Put beans in a large saucepan with enough water to cover by 2 inches. Bring to a boil, then boil 2 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, 1 hour. Drain well.
Cook onion, garlic, chiles, Cubanelles, recao, and sun-dried tomatoes in oil in a large heavy pot over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until browned, about 12 minutes. Add bay leaf and pimentón and cook, stirring, 2 minutes, then add beans and water and simmer, covered, until beans are very tender, 11/2 to 2 hours. Discard bay leaf.
Purée soup in batches in a blender (use caution when blending hot liquids). Reheat over medium-low heat. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in lemon juice.
Make gremolata: Stir together zest, garlic, and parsley.
Serve soup sprinkled with gremolata and drizzled with oil.

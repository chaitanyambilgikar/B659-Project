1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Generously grease and flour 2 (8-inch) cake pans.
2. In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the butter and sugar and beat on medium speed until the mixture is smooth and light in texture, about 4 minutes. While the butter is beating, sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl and set aside.
3. Add the eggs and egg whites to the butter-sugar mixture, one at a time, beating well and scraping down the bowl after each addition. In a small bowl or measuring cup, combine the vanilla with the milk. In 3 additions alternate adding the sifted dry ingredients and wet ingredients to the butter-sugar mixture, mixing on low speed until just incorporated.
4. Divide the batter evenly between the 2 pans and bake until the cakes spring back when touched lightly in the center, 35 to 40 minutes.
5. Remove the cakes from the oven and let cool for 20 minutes, or until the cakes are set and the pans are cool enough to handle. Release the sides of the cakes from the pans with a narrow metal spatula or knife and invert them onto a wire rack to cool completely.

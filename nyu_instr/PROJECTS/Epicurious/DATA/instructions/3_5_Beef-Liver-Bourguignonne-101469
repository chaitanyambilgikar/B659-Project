Dredge the liver slices with seasoned flour and sauté in 6 tablespoons butter until nicely browned on each side and still rare and juicy in the center. Remove liver to a hot platter, cover with a hot plate and keep in a warm spot.
Sauté diced bacon or pork and onions in the pan in which liver cooked, adding more butter if necessary. When cooked, add just enough red wine to cover and simmer gently for 5 minutes.
Meanwhile sauté garlic in 5-6 tablespoons butter, add croutons and cook, turning frequently, until they are nicely browned and crisp.
When sauce has simmered for 5 minutes, add liver slices and let them cook until just heated through. Arrange liver on a hot platter, spoon some of the sauce over it, top with croutons and garnish with chopped parsley and chives. Serve with potatoes Anna and rest of sauce in a sauceboat. With this, drink a good Burgundy or Pinot Noir.

Mix oregano, cumin, and paprika in small bowl. Sprinkle steaks with salt and pepper, then sprinkle each side of each steak with generous 1 teaspoon spice mixture, pressing to adhere.
Heat oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add steaks and cook to desired doneness, about 5 minutes per side for medium-rare. Transfer to platter. Combine broth, vinegar, honey, and remaining spice mixture in same skillet; boil until sauce is slightly reduced, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat; whisk in butter. Season sauce with salt and pepper. Pour sauce over steaks and serve.

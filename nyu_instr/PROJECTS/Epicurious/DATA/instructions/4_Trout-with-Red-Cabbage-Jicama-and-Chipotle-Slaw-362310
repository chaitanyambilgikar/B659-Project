Whisk mayonnaise, 2 tablespoons lime juice, 1 1/2 teaspoons chipotles, and cumin in large bowl to blend. Sprinkle fish on both sides with salt and pepper. Measure 4 teaspoons chipotle mayonnaise and spread over flesh side of trout fillets. Whisk yogurt into remaining chipotle mayonnaise in bowl. Add cabbage, jicama, and 1/2 cup cilantro to chipotle dressing and toss to coat, adding more lime juice, if desired. Season slaw generously with salt and pepper.
Heat large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add trout, flesh side down, and cook until deep golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn fish fillets over and cook until just opaque in center, about 2 minutes. Place 1 fish fillet on each of 4 plates. Spoon slaw alongside; sprinkle slaw with pepitas, if desired. Sprinkle fish with 1 tablespoon cilantro and serve with lime wedges.

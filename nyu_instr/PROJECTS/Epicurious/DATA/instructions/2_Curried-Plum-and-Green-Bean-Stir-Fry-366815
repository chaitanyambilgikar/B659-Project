In a small saucepan, bring rice, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1 1/4 cups water to a boil. Reduce heat to low; cover; simmer until rice is tender and absorbs the water, 30 to 35 minutes. Turn off heat; leave covered. In a large skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat. Cook scallion whites, chile, ginger, curry, black pepper and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, stirring, 2 minutes. Add 1/2 cup water and green beans; cook, stirring, until beans turn bright green, about 2 minutes. Add plums, bell pepper and coconut milk; cook and stir until colors are bright and sauce is thick, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in cashews. Divide plum–green bean mixture among 4 plates. Serve with rice; sprinkle with scallion greens before serving.

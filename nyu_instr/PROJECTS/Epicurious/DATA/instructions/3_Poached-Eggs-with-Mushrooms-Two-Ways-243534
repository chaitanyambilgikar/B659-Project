Prepare mushrooms: Preheat oven to 450°F with racks in upper and lower thirds.
Thinly slice two thirds of mushrooms 1/8 inch thick. Toss with 1/4 cup oil, 3/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper, then spread evenly in 2 large 4-sided sheet pans. Roast, switching position of pans and stirring mushrooms occasionally, until all of liquid has evaporated and mushrooms are golden and crisp, 30 to 40 minutes.
Meanwhile, cut remaining mushrooms into 1/2-inch wedges. Finely chop parsley with garlic. Heat remaining tablespoon oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers, then sautémushroom wedges with 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and pepper 1 minute. Add red-wine vinegar and sauté 1 minute. Stir in parsley mixture and butter and sauté until butter has melted. Season with salt. Remove from heat and keep warm, covered.
Poach eggs while mushrooms roast: Bring 1 1/4 inches water to a boil in a deep large skillet or saucepan with distilled vinegar. Break each egg into a cup and slide egg into water, spacing eggs apart. Poach at a bare simmer until whites are firm but yolks are still runny, 2 to 3 minutes.
To serve: Stir together mushrooms and 1/4 teaspoon toasted cumin in a large bowl, then divide among plates. Lift eggs out of poaching liquid 1 at a time with a slotted spoon and drain briefly in spoon on paper towels before transferring to mushrooms. Drizzle with oil and sprinkle with sea salt and remaining toasted cumin to taste.

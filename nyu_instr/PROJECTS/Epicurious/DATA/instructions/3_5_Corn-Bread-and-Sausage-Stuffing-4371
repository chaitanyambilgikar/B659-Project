Preheat oven to 400°F. Butter 13x9x2-inch glass baking dish. Combine first 5 ingredients in large bowl. Whisk milk, oil and eggs in medium bowl to blend. Add milk mixture to dry ingredients and stir just until blended. Transfer batter to prepared dish. Bake until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Cool. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and let stand at room temperature.)
Preheat oven to 375°F. Cut enough corn bread into 1/2-inch cubes to measure 12 cups (reserve remaining bread for another use). Transfer to baking sheet. Bake until bread cubes are dry but not hard, about 15 minutes. Transfer to large bowl. Maintain oven temperature.
Butter 13x9x2-inch glass baking dish. Cook chorizo in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat until brown, crumbling with back of spoon, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low. Add onions, red peppers and chili; sauté until tender, about 15 minutes. Stir chorizo mixture, cilantro and oregano into bread. Mix in enough broth to moisten. Spoon into prepared dish. Cover with buttered foil. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover; chill.)
Bake until heated through, about 45 minutes if stuffing is at room temperature and 1 hour if chilled.

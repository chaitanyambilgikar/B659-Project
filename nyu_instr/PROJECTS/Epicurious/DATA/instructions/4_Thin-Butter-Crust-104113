1. Mix together the flour and salt. Cut the butter into pieces the size of a walnut (about 1 1/2 tablespoons). Mix the flour and butter together in a large bowl, using only your hands, until the butter begins to break up.
2. When the flour has just begun to pick up a little color from the butter , add the water, a bit at a time, and mix until the dough starts to come together. Since the exact amount of water needed will always vary, you have to develop a feel for how much to use.
3. Remove the dough from the bowl to a floured surface and knead briefly, just until the dough begins to smooth out. Wrap in waxed paper or plastic wrap and refrigerate immediately. Allow the dough to rest for at least 30 minutes.
4. When ready to roll out the dough, divide it in half. Place one half on a floured surface; return the other half to the refrigerator. To roll out the dough, form each half into a flat circle and quickly roll it out in the shape required. Always roll the dough very thin (about 1/4 inch). Line the pie pan with one half and set aside the second half for the upper crust. Refrigerate until ready to use.
5. When assembling the pie, wet the edges where the two crusts join, to form a seal. Using your thumb and index finger, crimp them together. Make vents for the steam to escape.
VARIATION Roll out the dough in one piece and cut out circles 1 1/2 to 2 inches in diameter larger than the tartlet forms. Place the circles in the forms and line with parchment paper or aluminum foil. Add beans, rice or pie beads. Prebake blind at 350 degrees. Cooking time is determined by final use.

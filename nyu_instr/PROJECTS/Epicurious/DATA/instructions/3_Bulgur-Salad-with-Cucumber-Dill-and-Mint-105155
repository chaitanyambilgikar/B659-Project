Place bulgur in large bowl. Whisk lemon juice, oil and garlic to blend in small bowl; pour over bulgur. Mix in cucumbers, parsley, green onions, dill, and mint. Cover and chill until bulgur is tender, about 6 hours. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Keep chilled.) Serve cold or at room temperature.

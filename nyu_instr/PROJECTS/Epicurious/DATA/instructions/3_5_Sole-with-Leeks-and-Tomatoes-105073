Heat 3 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add leeks, garlic, thyme, and bay leaf. Sauté until leeks are tender, about 5 minutes. Add vegetable broth and wine; boil 5 minutes. Add tomatoes with juices. Boil until sauce thickens, about 5 minutes. Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.
Meanwhile, sprinkle fish with salt and pepper. Fold each fillet in half; secure with toothpick. Dust outside of fish with flour. Heat remaining 3 tablespoons oil in another large skillet over medium-high heat. Add fish and sauté until golden and just opaque in center, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer fish to plates; remove toothpicks. Top fish with sauce.

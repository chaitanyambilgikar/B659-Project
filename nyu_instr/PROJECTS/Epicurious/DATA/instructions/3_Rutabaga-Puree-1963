Cook rutabagas in large pot of boiling salted water until very tender, about 30 minutes. Drain well. Transfer rutabagas to processor. Add cream and butter and puree until smooth. Transfer to bowl. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 2 hours ahead. Cover and let stand at room temperature. Rewarm over low heat, stirring often.) Mix in parsley and mint.

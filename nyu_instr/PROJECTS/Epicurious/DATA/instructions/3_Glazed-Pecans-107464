Preheat oven to 325°F. Spray large baking sheet with nonstick spray. Stir pecans and oil in medium bowl to coat. Mix sugar, cayenne, and salt in small bowl, then add to pecan mixture and toss to coat. Scatter coated pecans on prepared baking sheet. Bake until pecans are brown and crisp, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes. Transfer baking sheet to rack and cool completely. (Can be made 3 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.)

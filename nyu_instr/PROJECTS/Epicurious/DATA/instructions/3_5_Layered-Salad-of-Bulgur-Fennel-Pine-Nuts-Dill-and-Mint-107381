Place the bulgur or cracked wheat in a large salad bowl. In a small bowl, whisk together 1 cup lemon juice, the olive oil, garlic, and 1 teaspoon salt; drizzle this dressing over the bulgur. Layer on the scallions, parsley, dill, mint, and cucumbers. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper over the top. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 24 hours or up to 48 hours.
Bring the salad to room temperature.
Meanwhile, cut the fennel bulb in half from top to bottom. Cut the halves into paper-thin slices crosswise. Add the fennel and pine nuts to the salad and toss. Season with salt, pepper, and lemon juice to taste and serve.

Stir the pancake batter and citrus zest together in a bowl.
Ever so gently fold in the ricotta cheese, taking care not to destroy its texture.
Prepare the griddle.
Drop the pancake batter on the griddle according to the instructions and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, until bubbles appear on almost the entire surface of the pancakes.
Turn and very gently tap the pancakes with a metal spatula to make them uniform in thickness.
Cook until the second side is golden, about 2 minutes, and serve A-side up.

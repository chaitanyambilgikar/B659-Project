Steam cauliflower until very tender, about 10 minutes. Transfer cauliflower to processor. Add 1 tablespoon butter and milk; blend until smooth. Season puree with nutmeg, salt and pepper.
Scoop out tomato halves; discard pulp. Place tomatoes, cut side down, on paper towels and drain well. Arrange tomatoes, cut side up, on small baking sheet. Fill with cauliflower puree.
Preheat oven to 350°F. Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in medium skillet over medium heat. Mix in mustard. Add breadcrumbs and toss until crumbs begin to brown, about 8 minutes. Mix in parsley. Sprinkle crumb mixture over puree. Bake tomatoes until heated through, about 30 minutes.

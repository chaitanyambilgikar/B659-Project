Bring chopped cauliflower and milk to boil in heavy large saucepan. Reduce heat to medium and simmer uncovered until cauliflower is tender, about 9 minutes. Stir in whipping cream and 2 tablespoons butter. Cool soup slightly. Working in batches, puree soup in blender. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Keep soup warm.
Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add bread pieces and stir until brown and crisp, about 9 minutes. Season croutons to taste with salt and pepper. Stir in thyme.
Divide soup among 4 bowls. Mound thyme croutons atop soup and serve.

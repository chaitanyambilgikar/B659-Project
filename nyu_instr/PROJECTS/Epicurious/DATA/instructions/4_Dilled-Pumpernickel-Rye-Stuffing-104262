Preheat oven to 200°F.
Cut enough of both breads into 1-inch cubes to measure 6 cups each. Spread bread cubes in 2 large shallow baking pans and bake in upper and lower thirds of oven, stirring occasionally and switching position of pans halfway through baking, until bread is dry, 50 minutes to 1 hour total. Cool.
Increase oven temperature to 400°F.
Meanwhile, cook carrots, celery, and onions in oil and butter in a 5-quart heavy pot over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until softened and beginning to brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms begin to give off liquid, about 10 minutes.
Remove pot from heat and stir in bread, dill, parsley, caraway, and salt and pepper to taste. Add broth and toss until bread is evenly moistened. (Use 3 cups broth if you like a moist stuffing, 2 1/2 cups if you prefer it drier.)
Mound stuffing in a buttered 4-quart shallow baking dish. Cover with buttered foil and bake in middle of oven 30 minutes, then uncover and bake until top is crisp and stuffing is heated through, about 15 minutes more.

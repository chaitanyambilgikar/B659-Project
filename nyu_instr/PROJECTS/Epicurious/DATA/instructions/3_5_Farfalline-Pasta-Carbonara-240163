Cut bacon crosswise into 1/4-inch-wide strips and cook in a large heavy skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until crisp. Remove from heat.
Cook farfalline in a pasta pot of boiling salted water (2 tablespoons salt for 6 quarts water) according to package directions, stirring in peas 4 minutes before pasta is al dente.
Meanwhile, whisk together eggs, cheese, kosher salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper in a large bowl.
Reserve 1 cup pasta-cooking water, then drain. Add pasta to eggs along with 1/2 cup reserved cooking water and bacon with drippings, tossing to combine. Add more cooking water to moisten if necessary. Season with salt and pepper.

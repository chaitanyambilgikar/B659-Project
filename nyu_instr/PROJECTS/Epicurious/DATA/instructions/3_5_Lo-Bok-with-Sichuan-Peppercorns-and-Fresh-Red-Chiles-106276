Cut radish and carrots into fine julienne with mandoline, then toss with 2 tablespoons kosher salt in a bowl and let stand 1 hour. Drain in a colander, then squeeze handfuls in a kitchen towel to remove moisture and transfer to a bowl.
While vegetables are standing, heat vinegars, sugar, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt in a small nonreactive saucepan over moderate heat, stirring, until sugar is dissolved.
Meanwhile, heat peanut oil in a small heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then sauté dried chiles and Sichuan peppercorns, stirring, until chiles are blackened, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in ginger and fresh chiles, then stir into vinegar mixture. Cool sauce.
Pour sauce through a fine sieve into bowl with radish and carrots. Add scallion, cilantro, and sesame oil and marinate, tossing occasionally, 30 minutes.

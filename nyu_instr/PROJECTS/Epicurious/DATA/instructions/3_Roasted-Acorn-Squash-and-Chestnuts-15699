Preheat oven to 450°F.
Halve squash lengthwise and discard seeds and strings. Cut each half lengthwise into 3 wedges and arrange wedges, skin sides down, in a shallow baking pan. In a small saucepan melt butter with brown sugar over moderate heat, stirring occasionally until sugar is dissolved. Stir in nutmeg and cloves and remove pan from heat. Spoon butter mixture over squash and cover baking pan with foil.
Bake squash in middle of oven 30 minutes. Remove pan from oven and scatter chestnuts over squash. Re-cover pan with foil and roast squash and chestnuts 30 minutes, or until squash is tender. Squash and chestnuts may be made up to this point 6 hours ahead and kept, covered, at room temperature.
Remove foil from pan and bake squash and chestnuts 20 minutes more. With a slotted spoon transfer squash and chestnuts to a serving dish. Stir sauce, scraping up brown-sugar drippings, and spoon over squash and chestnuts.

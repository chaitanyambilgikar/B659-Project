Preheat oven to 425°F. Scrub potatoes; pat dry. Rub skins with oil. Place potatoes on baking sheet. Bake until potatoes are tender, about 1 hour. Cool. Maintain oven temperature. Cut each potato lengthwise into quarters. Scoop out centers, leaving 1/2-inch-thick layer of cooked potato on skins. Oil baking sheet. Place skins, skin side down, on sheet, spacing 1 inch apart. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Cook bacon in heavy large skillet over medium heat until brown and crisp. Drain. Chop bacon. Transfer to medium bowl. Add cheeses, parsley and cayenne; stir to blend. Sprinkle cheese mixture atop skins. Bake until skins are crisp and cheese mixture melts, about 25 minutes.
Transfer skins to platter. Sprinkle with green onions; top with dollops of sour cream and serve.

Mix yogurt, 3 tablespoons feta cheese, garlic, rosemary and pepper in large bowl. Add chicken; toss to coat. Let marinate at room temperature 30 minutes.
Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat) or preheat broiler. Thread chicken and red bell pepper pieces alternately onto skewers. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill or broil until chicken is cooked through, turning occasionally, about 8 minutes.
Transfer brochettes to platter. Sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoons feta cheese and serve.

Preheat oven to 450°F. Halve squash lengthwise and discard seeds. Peel squash and cut enough 3/4-inch cubes to measure 6 cups. Trim and peel beets. Cut beets and onion into 3/4-inch cubes. In a 17- by 11-inch roasting pan toss squash, beets, and onion with oil until coated and season with salt and pepper.
Roast vegetables in middle of oven 25 minutes. Thinly slice garlic and scatter over vegetables. Roast vegetables 8 minutes more, or until barely tender. Season halibut with salt and pepper and arrange on top of vegetables. Roast halibut in middle of oven until just cooked through, about 8 minutes.
Serve halibut over vegetables with sauce.

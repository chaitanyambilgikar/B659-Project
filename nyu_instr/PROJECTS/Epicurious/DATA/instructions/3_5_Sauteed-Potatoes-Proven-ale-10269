In a small saucepan combine the vinegar, the garlic, the zest, and salt and pepper to taste, bring the mixture to a boil, and simmer it for 2 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and whisk in 1/4 cup of the oil. In each of 2 large skillets heat 2 tablespoons of the remaining oil over moderately high heat until it is hot but not smoking and in it cook the potatoes in one layer in batches over moderate heat, turning them, for 10 to 15 minutes, or until they are golden brown on the outside and tender within. Transfer the potatoes to a serving dish, pour the garlic mixture over them, and toss them with the parsley.

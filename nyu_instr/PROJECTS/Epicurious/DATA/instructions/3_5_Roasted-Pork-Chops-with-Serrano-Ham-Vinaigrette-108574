For vinaigrette: Cook bacon in large skillet over medium heat until fat is rendered, about 6 minutes. Remove bacon and reserve for another use. Transfer 1/3 cup bacon drippings to measuring cup (add vegetable oil to measure 1/3 cup if necessary).
Boil broth in heavy small saucepan until reduced to 1 cup, about 10 minutes. Set aside. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in medium nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Add shallot; sauté until tender, about 3 minutes. Add chopped ham, then brown sugar and vinegar. Increase heat to medium; stir until mixture is syrupy, about 2 minutes. Add reduced broth; boil until slightly reduced, about 3 minutes. Pour through strainer into same small saucepan; discard solids in strainer. Set vinaigrette aside.
For pork chops: Preheat oven to 375°F. Sprinkle pork chops with salt and pepper. Heat oil in heavy large skillet over high heat. Working in batches, add pork chops to skillet; cook until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to roasting pan large enough to hold chops in single layer. Add thyme sprigs to pan; place in oven and roast until instant-read thermometer inserted into chops registers 150°F, about 8 minutes. Remove from oven; let stand while finishing vinaigrette.
Rewarm vinaigrette over medium heat. Whisk in bacon drippings and Serrano ham. Season with salt and pepper. Place 1 pork chop on each of 6 plates. Drizzle with melted butter. Sprinkle with fleur de sel, if desired. Spoon vinaigrette over. Serve with potato gratins.

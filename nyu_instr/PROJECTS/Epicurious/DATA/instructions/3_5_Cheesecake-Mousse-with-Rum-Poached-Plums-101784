Have ready a bowl of ice and cold water. In a small saucepan simmer 1 cup water, granulated sugar, and rum, stirring occasionally, 10 minutes. Pit plums and cut each plum into 12 wedges. Simmer plums in syrup until tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer plum mixture to a bowl and set it in bowl of ice water. Let plum mixture stand, stirring occasionally, until chilled.
In a bowl whisk together cream cheese, confectioners' sugar, vanilla, and a pinch salt until smooth. In another bowl beat heavy cream until it holds soft peaks and whisk into cream-cheese mixture. Divide mixture between 2 goblets and chill, covered, 15 minutes. Serve mousse topped with plums and some syrup.

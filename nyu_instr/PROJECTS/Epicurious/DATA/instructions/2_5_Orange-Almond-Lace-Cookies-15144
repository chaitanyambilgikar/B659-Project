Preheat oven to 350°F. In a baking pan toast almonds in one layer in middle of oven until golden, about 10 minutes.
In a 1- to 1 1/2-quart heavy saucepan bring orange juice, sugar, and butter to a boil over moderate heat, stirring, and boil about 5 minutes or until mixture is thick and bubbles are tan-colored. Remove pan from heat and stir in almonds, zest, flour, vinegar, and a pinch salt until mixture is combined well. Cool dough to room temperature. Form and bake cookies as directed below.
To form and bake lace cookies: Preheat oven to 350°F and line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper.
Roll level 1/2-teaspoons dough into balls and arrange 4 inches apart on baking sheets. Bake cookies in batches in upper and lower thirds of oven, switching position of sheets halfway through baking, 10 minutes, or until cookies are flat and golden. Transfer parchment with cookies to racks to cool. Cool baking sheets and line with fresh parchment between batches.

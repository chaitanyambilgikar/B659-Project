For cakes: Preheat oven to 350#176;F. Brush six 4-inch-diameter tartlet pans with 1 1/8-inch-high sides and removable bottoms* with melted butter. Place pans on baking sheet. Using electric mixer, beat 1/2 cup butter and sugar in large bowl until light. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Mix in vanilla. Sift flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt over mixture in bowl. Mix slightly, then add buttermilk; beat until combined. Divide batter among prepared pans (about scant 1/2 cup each).
Bake cakes until golden and tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Transfer pans to rack; cool 5 minutes. Push up bottoms of pans to release cakes. Cool cakes on rack.
For sauce and topping: Puree thawed raspberries with their syrup in processor. Strain through sieve set over bowl, pressing on solids to extract liquid. (Cakes and berry sauce can be made 1 day ahead. Cover cakes and store at room temperature. Cover sauce and chill.)
Combine peaches, fresh raspberries and 4 tablespoons sugar in medium bowl; toss to blend. Let stand until juices form, about 30 minutes.
Beat cream, vanilla and remaining 2 tablespoons sugar in medium bowl until stiff peaks form.
Using serrated knife, cut cakes in half horizontally. Lightly sift powdered sugar over cake tops. Place 1 cake bottom on each of 6 plates. Top each with peach mixture, dividing equally. Spoon cream atop each. Cover with cake tops. Spoon raspberry sauce around cakes.

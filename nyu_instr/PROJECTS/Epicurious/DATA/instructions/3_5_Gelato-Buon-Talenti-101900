In a 2-quart heavy saucepan bring milk and about half of sugar just to a simmer, stirring until sugar is dissolved.
Have ready a large bowl of ice and cold water. In a bowl with an electric mixer beat yolks and remaining sugar until thick and pale. Add hot milk mixture in a slow stream, whisking, and pour into saucepan. Cook custard over moderately low heat, stirring constantly, until a thermometer registers 170°F. (Do not let boil.) Pour custard through a sieve into a metal bowl set in ice and cold water and cool. Stir in cream and add liqueur. Chill custard, covered, until cold and up to 4 hours.
Freeze custard in an ice-cream maker. Serve gelato immediately or transfer to an airtight container and put in freezer to harden no more than 2 hours.

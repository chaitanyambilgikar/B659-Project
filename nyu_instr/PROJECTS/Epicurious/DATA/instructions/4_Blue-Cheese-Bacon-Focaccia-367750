Dissolve yeast and honey in 1/2 cup warm water (110°F-115°F) in a small bowl. Let sit until foamy, about 10 minutes. Combine 4 1/2 cups flour, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Add the yeast mixture, 6 tablespoons oil, potatoes, and 1 cup warm water. Mix with a wooden spoon until almost incorporated, then finish mixing with your hands. Transfer dough to a floured work surface and knead until smooth, 4–6 minutes, adding more flour by tablespoonfuls if dough seems very sticky (dough should be soft and elastic).
Brush a large bowl with oil; place dough in bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and place in a warm, draft-free area. Let rise until doubled, about 1 hour.
Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add bacon and cook until it is light golden but not crisp. Transfer to paper towels to drain.
Preheat oven to 425°F. Brush a 17x11x1" baking sheet with oil. Press dough into pan. Press with your fingertips all over, forming dimples. Drizzle remaining 2 tablespoons oil over.
Bake focaccia for 10 minutes. Sprinkle cheese over, then bacon and rosemary. Return to oven and bake until golden brown, 12–15 minutes longer. Let cool for 10 minutes in pan. Slide bread onto a wire rack to cool completely. Slice into 2x1" pieces.

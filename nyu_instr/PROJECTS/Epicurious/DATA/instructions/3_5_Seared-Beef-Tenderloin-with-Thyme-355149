Grind the peppercorns and mix with the salt and thyme leaves. Rub the beef lightly with some of the olive oil, then rub the pepper mixture all over the beef. Heat a ridged cast-iron grill pan until very hot. Put the beef in the pan and sear on all sides, then remove from the pan and let cool.
Use a long, sharp knife to slice the beef as thinly as possible. Place the slices on a board and press them with the flat side of the knife blade to flatten each slice and make it bigger.
Cover the serving plates with the beef. Season, then drizzle with half the lemon juice. Toss the salad leaves and sprouts with some olive oil and a little more lemon juice. Scatter the leaves over the beef, then shave the cheese on top. Drizzle with a little more olive oil and serve with the lemon wedges.

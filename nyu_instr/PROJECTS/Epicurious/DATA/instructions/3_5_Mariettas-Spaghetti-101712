Preheat oven to 350°F.
Preparing the Tomatoes Cut the tomatoes in half lengthwise, and place them — cut side up — in a large shallow baking dish. Salt and pepper them lightly.
Preparing the Garlic, Parsley, and Olive Oil Peel and finely chop 3 cloves of garlic.
Wash the parsley and pat dry; remove and discard the stems. Finely chop the leaves (you want about 1/2 cup.)
Mix together the garlic, half of the parsley, and 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a small bowl. Using a spoon or your fingers, pat the garlic mixture on the tomatoes, and drizzle on 2 more tablespoons of the olive oil.
Bake for 45 minutes, uncovered. The tomatoes should be mushy; if not, bake for another 10 minutes and test again.
Cooking the Spaghetti After the tomatoes have baked for 30 minutes, fill a 6-quart pot about 2/3 full of water, stir in the 1 tablespoon salt, and set over high heat, covered. When the water reaches a full boil, add the spaghetti and stir. After about 10 minutes, start testing pieces of pasta every minute or so until the spaghetti feels tender but still firm.
Pour the water and the spaghetti into a colander set in the sink. Let the pasta drain.
Finishing the Pasta Melt the butter in a small pot over medium heat.
Chop the basil leaves into small pieces.
In a large serving bowl, mix together the remaining parsley and olive oil, the melted butter, and the basil. Add the drained spaghetti and the baked tomatoes. Using two forks, lift small batches of spaghetti until it is all coated with the oil-butter mixtue and the tomatoes are well distributed. Serve immediately.

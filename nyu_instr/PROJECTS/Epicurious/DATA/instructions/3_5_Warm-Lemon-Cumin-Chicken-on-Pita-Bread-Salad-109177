Combine chicken and 1/4 cup oil in large bowl. Add garlic, 3 tablespoons lemon juice, 5 teaspoons cumin, and lemon peel. Rub mixture into chicken to coat. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
Preheat oven to 400°F. Combine remaining 6 tablespoons oil, 3 tablespoons lemon juice, 1 teaspoon cumin, pita bread, parsley, tomatoes, green onions, and 1/2 cup mint in large bowl. Season salad with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate while cooking chicken.
Transfer chicken from marinade to rimmed baking sheet; sprinkle with salt. Bake chicken 10 minutes; turn over and bake until cooked through, about 10 minutes longer. Place chicken on cutting board; slice each breast crosswise into 5 pieces. Arrange salad on large platter. Place chicken atop salad; pour any drippings from baking sheet over chicken. Garnish with remaining 2 tablespoons mint.

Preheat broiler. Whisk eggs in large bowl to blend. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Heat 10-inch broiler proof nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.
Add butter and let brown. Add eggs to skillet; stir with heatproof spatula until eggs are softly set but still a little runny, about 30 seconds. Sprinkle smoked whitefish and cheddar cheese over eggs, then drizzle with cream. Broil until omelet is set and golden brown at edges, about 1 minute. Slide omelet out onto platter. Cut omelet into wedges and serve.

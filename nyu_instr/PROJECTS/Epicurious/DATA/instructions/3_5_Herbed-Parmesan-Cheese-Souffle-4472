Preheat oven to 350°F. Generously butter and flour 7- to 8-cup soufflé dish. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in heavy large saucepan over medium heat. Add flour; stir 2 minutes. Gradually whisk in milk, then nutmeg. Bring to simmer, whisking constantly. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook sauce until very thick, whisking often, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Mix in cheese and herbs. Season with salt and pepper. Cool 1 minute. (Soufflé base can be made 2 hours ahead. Cover and let stand at room temperature. Before continuing, stir soufflé base over low heat until warm.)
Whisk yolks in medium bowl to blend. Gradually whisk in soufflé base. Using electric mixer, beat whites in large bowl until stiff but not dry. Fold whites into soufflé base in 2 additions. Transfer batter to prepared dish.
Bake soufflé until top is puffed and golden brown and center is just set, about 35 minutes. Serve immediately.

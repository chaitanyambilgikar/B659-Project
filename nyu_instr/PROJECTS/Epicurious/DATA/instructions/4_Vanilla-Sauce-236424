Bring milk with a pinch of salt to a simmer in a 2-quart heavy saucepan. Whisk together yolks and sugar in a bowl until combined, then add hot milk mixture in a slow stream, whisking. Transfer custard to same saucepan and cook over moderately low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until custard coats back of a spoon and thermometer registers 170 to 175°F. Pour through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl and stir in vanilla. Cover surface of custard with a round of wax paper and chill until cold, at least 1 hour.

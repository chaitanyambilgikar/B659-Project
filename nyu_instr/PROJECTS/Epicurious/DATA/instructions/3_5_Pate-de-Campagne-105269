1. Place the pork, olive oil, shallots, onion, all but six sprigs of the thyme, and all but six of the bay leaves, and the remaining herbs and salt in a large, non-reactive bowl and toss so that all is thoroughly combined. Cover and refrigerate for 24 hours.
2. Remove the bay leaves and the thyme from the pork, and transfer the meat to a food processor. Process until the meat is coarsely chopped. The meat needs to be in uneven pieces to give texture to the pâté.
3. Place the liver in the food processor and purée it. Add it to the pork and other ingredients in the bowl and toss until all the ingredients are thoroughly combined. Cook a teaspoonful of the mixture to taste for seasoning, remembering that when the pâté is chilled its seasoning will be muted. Adjust the seasoning if necessary.
4. Place three of the bay leaves and three generous sprigs of thyme on the bottom of an 8 cup (2 liter) porcelain terrine mold, or other non-reactive container. Top with half the pork mixture, smoothing and pressing it into the terrine, then top with the remaining three sprigs of thyme. Cover with the remaining pork mixture, smoothing it out and pressing it down into the terrine, then top that with the remaining three bay leaves. Top with parchment paper and then either the lid of the terrine mold, or a piece of aluminum foil. Place the terrine mold into a pan large enough to hold it with room to spare, and pour in boiling water half way up the sides of the terrine mold Bake until the terrine is cooked through and registers about 170°F on a meat thermometer inserted into the center of the terrine, about 2 hours.
5. Remove from the oven and let cool. Place at least 3 one-pound weights on the parchment paper atop the terrine, to weight it down, and when it has reached room temperature refrigerate it for at least 24 hours. Serve chilled, with plenty of cornichons alongside.

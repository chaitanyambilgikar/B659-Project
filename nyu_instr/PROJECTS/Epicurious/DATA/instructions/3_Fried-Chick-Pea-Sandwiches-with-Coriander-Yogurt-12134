In a food processor purée the chick-peas with the garlic, the cumin, the salt, and pepper to taste until the mixture is smooth. Transfer the mixture to a bowl, stir in the scallion, 3 tablespoons of the coriander, and the sesame seeds, and form the mixture into four 1/2-inch-thick patties. Dredge the patties in the flour and freeze them on a wax paper-lined plate for 10 minutes. In a heavy skillet heat the oil over moderartely high heat until it is hot but not smoking and in it sauté the patties, turning them carefully with a spatula, for 3 minutes on each side, or until they are golden brown. (The patties will be very soft.) Transfer each patty to a pita pocket and insert a tomato slice in each pocket. In a small bowl stir together the yogurt, the remaining 1 tablespoon coriander, and salt and pepper to taste and divide the sauce among the sandwiches.

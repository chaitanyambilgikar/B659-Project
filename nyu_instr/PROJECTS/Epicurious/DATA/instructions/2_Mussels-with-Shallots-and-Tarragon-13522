Scrub the mussels well in several changes of water, scrape off the beards, and rinse the mussels. In a 2-quart microwave-safe round glass casserole with a lid combine the wine, the shallots, the zest, the fennel seeds, and the tarragon and microwave the mixture, covered, at high power (100%) for 3 minutes. Stir in the mussels and microwave the mixture, covered, at high power, stirring once every minute and transferring any mussels that are wide open to a bowl and keeping them warm, for 2 1/2 to 4 minutes. Discard any unopened mussels. Return the mussels to the casserole, sprinkle them with the onion, and drizzle them with the oil. Let the mussels stand for 1 minute.

Preheat oven to 350°F.
In a small bowl, mix all the ingredients together. On a baking sheet coated lightly with cooking spray or lined with parchment paper, place tablespoonfuls of the mixture with a couple inches between each, and spread them out into ovals about four inches long and two wide. (You should have about 12 crisps.) Bake in the oven until they turn golden brown, 6 to 8 minutes. If not shaping them around a spoon handle, cool crisps flat on a metal rack.

In a medium bowl, whisk together the salt, pepper, ginger, garlic, cinnamon, cumin, agave nectar, yuzu juice, lemon zest and juice, and the oil. Using a rubber spatula, carefully fold in the crab and blueberries.
To serve, spoon the ceviche into bowls and garnish with a handful of popcorn per serving.

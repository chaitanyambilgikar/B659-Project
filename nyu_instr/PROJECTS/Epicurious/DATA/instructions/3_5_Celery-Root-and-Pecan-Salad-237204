Finely chop two thirds of nuts. Coarsely grate celery root in a food processor fitted with medium shredding disk.
Stir together vinegar, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until salt is dissolved, then add celery root, chopped nuts, parsley, and shallot and toss well. Drizzle salad with oil and toss again. Serve sprinkled with remaining pecans.

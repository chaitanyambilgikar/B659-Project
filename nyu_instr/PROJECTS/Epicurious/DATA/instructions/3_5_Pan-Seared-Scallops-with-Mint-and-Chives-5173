Melt butter in heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle scallops with salt and pepper. Add scallops to skillet and sauté until golden and just opaque in center, about 3 minutes per side. Using tongs, transfer scallops to plates. Add clam juice, lemon juice, mint and chives to same skillet. Boil until sauce thickens enough to coat spoon, about 3 minutes. Pour sauce over scallops and serve.

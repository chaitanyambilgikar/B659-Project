Mix egg salad, smoked ham, green onions, and tarragon in medium bowl. If the egg salad seems dry, stir in additional mayonnaise by tablespoonfuls. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Divide egg- salad mixture among bottom halves of rolls. Top with bell pepper rings, lettuce leaves, and top halves of rolls. Cut each sandwich in half and serve.

1. In a large bowl, mix the butter, shortening, and vanilla until well blended. Add the first 1 cup of confectioner's sugar and stir until the sugar is incorporated completely into the butter mixture. The filling should be thick and stiff. Add more confectioner’s sugar, one tablespoon at a time, to reach the desired consistency.
2. Place one-half of the chocolate wafer cookies upside down on a level surface. Divide the filling among the cookies and flatten with wet hands or a spoon. Place the other half of the cookies right side up on top of the filling and press down gently to create sandwich cookies.

Toast coriander seeds and grind in an electric coffee/spice grinder.
In a food processor, pulse together egg yolks, Pecorino Romano, cilantro, anchovy, garlic, lemon juice, vinegar, mustard, the ground coriander seeds, and salt and pepper until just combined.
With the machine running, slowly add olive oil and extra-virgin olive oil in a thin, steady stream until mixture is emulsified. Chill it, covered, until ready to serve.

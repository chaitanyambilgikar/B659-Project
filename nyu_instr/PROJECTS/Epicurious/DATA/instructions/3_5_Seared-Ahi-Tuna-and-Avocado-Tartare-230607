Heat heavy small skillet over high heat 2 minutes. Brush tuna with 1/2 tablespoon oil; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place in skillet and sear until brown outside and almost opaque in center, about 3 minutes per side. Cool tuna; dice finely. Combine tuna, remaining 3 tablespoons oil, and all remaining ingredients in medium bowl. Using fork, mix just to blend. Season tartare to taste with salt and pepper and chill.

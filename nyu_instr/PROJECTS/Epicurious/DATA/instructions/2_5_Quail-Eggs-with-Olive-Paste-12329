In a saucepan cover the eggs with cold water, bring the water just to a boil, and simmer the eggs for 5 minutes. Pour out the water, add cold water to the pan, and let the eggs cool until they can be handled. Shell 12 of the eggs carefully and halve them lengthwise, leaving the additional eggs unshelled. Spoon a small dollop of the olive paste onto each egg half, top the olive paste with a caper, and arrange the egg halves on a platter lined with the thyme branches and garnished with the additional eggs. Garnish the egg halves with the thyme sprigs.

Fill a 6-quart kettle three-fourths full with salted water and bring to a boil for macaroni. Cut ham and celery into 1/4-inch dice and chop parsley.
Cook macaroni in boiling water 5 minutes, or until just tender (using package instructions as a guide), adding peas to cook for last 2 minutes. In a colander drain macaroni and peas and rinse under cold water. Drain macaroni and peas well.
In a large bowl whisk together mayonnaise and lemon juice and whisk in 2 tablespoons milk. Add macaroni, peas, ham, celery, parsley, currants, and salt and pepper to taste and toss to combine well. Salad may be made 2 days ahead and chilled, covered. If salad looks dry, toss with additional milk before serving. Serve salad at room temperature or chilled.

Peel and quarter potatoes, then cover with salted cold water by 2 inches in a 5-quart pot and simmer, covered, until just tender, 20 to 25 minutes.
While potatoes are cooking, whisk together mustard, vinegar, capers, salt, pepper, and shallot. Add oil in a slow stream, whisking until emulsified.
Drain potatoes in a colander and cool slightly. Break up warm potatoes into smaller chunks with a spoon and stir in vinaigrette and parsley. Serve potatoes warm.

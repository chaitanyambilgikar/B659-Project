Toss shrimp, fresh lime juice, 1/3 of garlic, 1/4 teaspoon oregano and 1/4 teaspoon cumin in medium bowl. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Refrigerate at least 15 minutes and up to 4 hours.
Meanwhile, heat oil in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onions, all bell peppers, 2 tablespoons parsley, dried red pepper, bay leaf, remaining garlic, 1/2 teaspoon cumin and 1/2 teaspoon oregano. Sauté until onions are beginning to brown, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomato paste and sauté 1 minute. Stir in wine and 1/4 cup water; simmer until slightly thickened, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Add shrimp and simmer until opaque in center, stirring occasionally, about 6 minutes. Discard bay leaf. Season stew to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer to platter and sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoons parsley.

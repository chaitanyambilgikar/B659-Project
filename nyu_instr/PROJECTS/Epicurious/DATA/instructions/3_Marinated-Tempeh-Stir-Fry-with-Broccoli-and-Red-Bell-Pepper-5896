Stir tempeh, soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, ginger and crushed red pepper in medium bowl to blend. Let marinate 1 hour at room temperature.
Steam broccoli until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Set aside. Strain marinade from tempeh into small bowl; set tempeh aside. Whisk 2 tablespoons water, honey and cornstarch into marinade.
Heat oil in large nonstick skillet over high heat. Add marinated tempeh and bell pepper and sauté 4 minutes. Add broccoli and marinade mixture and sauté until broccoli is heated through and sauce thickens, about 3 minutes. Transfer to bowl. Sprinkle with green onion and serve.

Sauté bacon in heavy large saucepan over medium heat until crisp. Spoon off all but 4 tablespoons drippings from pan. Add garlic to pan and stir 30 seconds. Add wine and scrape up any browned bits. Add tomatoes with juices, tomato paste, oregano and crushed red pepper. Simmer until sauce thickens slightly, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. Mix in 2 tablespoons parsley.
Meanwhile, cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite. Drain, reserving 1/2 cup cooking water.
Return pasta to pot. Add sauce. Toss over medium heat until sauce coats pasta, adding reserved cooking water by tablespoonfuls if mixture is dry. Mix in cheese. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to bowl. Sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoons parsley.

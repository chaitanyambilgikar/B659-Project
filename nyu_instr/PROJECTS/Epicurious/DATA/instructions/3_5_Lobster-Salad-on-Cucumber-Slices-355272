Peel and slice the cucumber into 1/8-inch-thick slices. (They need to be a little thick to support the weight of the lobster salad.) Reserve in a bowl of cold water until you’re ready to assemble the appetizers.
Chop the lobster meat into small pieces. Toss in a bowl with the mayo, yellow pepper, salt and pepper.
Place a spoonful on each cucumber slice.

Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter and flour a 3-quart bundt pan, knocking out excess flour. (Alternatively, use two 1-quart bundt pans and 2 pint-size loaf pans, 6 by 3 by 2 inches.)
Into a bowl sift together flour, cocoa powder, and salt.
In a large bowl with an electric mixer beat together butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in vanilla and add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. With mixer on low speed, beat in flour mixture gradually until just combined. Beat in espresso mixture and pour batter into prepared pan(s).
Bake cake in 3-quart pan in middle of oven until a tester comes out clean, about 1 hour 20 minutes. (Alternatively, bake cakes in 1-quart pans and loaf pans 40 minutes.) Cool cake in pan(s) on a rack 10 minutes and turn out onto rack to cool completely.
Pound cake keeps, wrapped well in plastic, 1 week.
Just before serving, sift confectioners' sugar evenly over cake.

In a small cup stir together salt and turmeric and sprinkle on both sides of orange roughy fillets. Let fillets stand at cool room temperature, loosely covered with plastic wrap, 10 minutes.
With a mortar and pestle or in an electric coffee/spice grinder coarsely grind mustard seeds. Coarsely chop onions and, wearing protective gloves, chop serranos. In a food processor coarsely grind onions, serranos, cilantro, and coconut, scraping down side occasionally. In a bowl dissolve tamarind concentrate in water, stirring.
In a 10- to 12-inch heavy skillet heat oil over moderate heat until hot but not smoking and cook mustard seeds about 30 seconds. Stir in onion mixture and cook, stirring, until fragrant, 6 to 8 minutes. Add fillets and cook 1 minute on each side. Add tamarind mixture and cook, gently stirring occasionally, until fish is just cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes.

Preheat oven to 400°F. Line twelve 1/3-cup muffin cups with paper liners. Combine first 6 ingredients in large bowl and stir to blend. Whisk buttermilk, applesauce, maple syrup, brown sugar, vegetable oil, egg and vanilla in medium bowl until well blended. Add to dry ingredients and stir just to incorporate (do not overmix).
Divide batter equally among muffin cups (batter will reach top of cups). Bake until muffin tops are golden brown and tester inserted into center of muffins comes out clean, about 28 minutes. Transfer to rack and cool.

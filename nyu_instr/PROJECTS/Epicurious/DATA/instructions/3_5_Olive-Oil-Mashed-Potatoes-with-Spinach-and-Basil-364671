Cook potatoes in large pot of boiling salted water until tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain; return to pot. Stir over low heat until excess moisture evaporates, 1 to 2 minutes. Using potato masher, mash warm potatoes. Mix in 6 tablespoons oil and 6 tablespoons chicken broth and stir to blend. Season to taste with coarse salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add spinach and toss 1 minute. Add basil leaves and toss until wilted, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Transfer mixture to sieve set over bowl. Drain well. DO AHEAD: Potatoes and spinach mixture can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand separately at room temperature.
Rewarm potatoes, adding more broth to moisten as needed. Stir in spinach mixture. Mound potatoes in bowl and serve.

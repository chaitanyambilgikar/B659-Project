In a 3-quart saucepan bring 2 quarts water to a boil and boil onions 2 minutes. Remove pan from heat and cool onions in cooking liquid until they can be handled. Carefully trim root ends and peel.
In a small bowl stir together water and salt until salt is dissolved and add onions.
Let onions stand, covered, at room temperature 24 hours.
Sterilize jars: Wash 1-pint Mason-type jars in hot suds and rinse in scalding water. Put jars in a kettle and cover with hot water. Bring water to a boil, covered, and boil jars 15 minutes from time that steam emerges from kettle. Turn off heat and let jars stand in hot water. Just before they are filled, invert jars into a kitchen towel to dry. (Jars should be filled while they are still hot.) Sterilize jar lids 5 minutes, or according to manufacturer's instructions.
Drain onions in a sieve and rinse well. Drain onions again and transfer to a sterilized jar.
In a small saucepan bring vinegar, sugar, and pickling spices to boil, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Pour vinegar mixture over onions and seal jar with lid. Marinate onions, covered and chilled, at least 4 days to develop flavors. Onions keep, covered and chilled, about 1 month, as long as they are removed with a clean fork or spoon.
Serve onions slightly chilled or at room temperature.

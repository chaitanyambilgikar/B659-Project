Preheat oven to 375°F. Combine sugar, 3 tablespoons water, and light corn syrup in small nonstick skillet. Stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat; boil without stirring until syrup is deep amber color, occasionally brushing down sides of skillet with wet pastry brush and swirling skillet, about 7 minutes. Remove from heat. Quickly stir in unsalted butter, fresh lemon juice, and salt. Immediately pour caramel into nonstick 9-inch-diameter cake pan with 1 1/2-inch-high sides.
Place unpeeled peach quarters, skin side down, in concentric circles atop caramel in cake pan, covering caramel completely. Bake until peaches are just tender, about 30 minutes. Remove cake pan from oven.
Roll out puff pastry sheet on lightly floured work surface to 12-inch square. Using 10-inch-diameter tart pan bottom or plate as guide, cut out round. Pierce pastry all over with fork. Cover peaches in cake pan with pastry round; press pastry down around peaches at edge of cake pan.
Bake tart until pastry is puffed and deep golden, about 27 minutes. (Can be prepared 6 hours ahead. Let stand in cake pan at room temperature. Rewarm tart in 350°F oven for 10 minutes before continuing.) Let tart rest 5 minutes. Cut around edge of cake pan to loosen pastry. Place large platter over cake pan. Using oven mitts, hold cake pan and platter firmly together and invert, allowing tart to settle onto platter. Carefully lift off cake pan. Rearrange any peaches that may have become dislodged. Cool tart 30 minutes. Sprinkle with lemon peel. Cut warm tart into wedges; serve with whipped cream.

Preheat broiler. Combine butter, anchovies, and milk in small saucepan over low heat. Cook until anchovies dissolve, mashing with back of spoon and stirring often, about 3 minutes (do not boil).
Place bread slices on rimmed baking sheet. Brush with oil; top with mozzarella slices. Broil until cheese melts and bread crisps, watching closely to prevent burning, about 3 minutes. Transfer crostini to platter.
Drizzle sauce over crostini; serve.

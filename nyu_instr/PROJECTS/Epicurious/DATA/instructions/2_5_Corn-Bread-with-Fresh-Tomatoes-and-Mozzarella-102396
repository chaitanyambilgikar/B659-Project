Position rack in bottom third of oven and preheat to 400°F. Butter 9x9x2-inch baking pan. Whisk 1 1/2 cups flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, salt and baking soda in large bowl to blend well. Combine mozzarella cubes and remaining 1 tablespoon flour in small bowl; toss to coat. Whisk buttermilk, eggs, olive oil and chopped Italian parsley in medium bowl to blend. Add buttermilk mixture to flour mixture and stir just to combine (do not overmix). Sprinkle mozzarella cubes and diced tomatoes over batter; stir gently just to distribute evenly.
Transfer batter to prepared pan. Bake corn bread until beginning to brown on top and tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 22 minutes. Transfer pan to rack. Cool bread 15 minutes. Cut into squares or wedges and serve warm.

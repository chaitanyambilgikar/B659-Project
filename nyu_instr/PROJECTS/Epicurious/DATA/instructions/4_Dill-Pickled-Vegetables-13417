In a large saucepan of boiling water blanch onions 3 minutes and drain in a colander. Cool onions just until they can be handled and peel. Arrange onions and carrots in two 1-quart Mason-type jars.
In pan bring vinegar, water, sugar, dill seeds, and salt to a boil and simmer 3 minutes. Pour hot mixture over onions and carrots and cool completely. Add celery. Chill vegetables, covered, at least 12 hours to develop flavors. Pickled vegetables may be made up to 3 weeks ahead but do not add celery until 1 day before serving.

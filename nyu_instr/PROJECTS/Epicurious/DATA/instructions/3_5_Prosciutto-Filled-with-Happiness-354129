Spread the pine nuts on a baking sheet and bake at 350°F until they turn golden brown. (I do mine in the toaster oven.) You'll want to keep a close eye on these because they go from golden brown to burned very quickly, as I've learned on three or four occasions. Transfer them to a small bowl and let them cool.
Cut each slice of prosciutto in half, crosswise. Don't worry if they're not perfect. Top each half-slice with a small piece of arugula, a dab of gorgonzola, a few pine nuts, and few currents. Then roll them into little mini horns.
Arrange on a platter and serve.

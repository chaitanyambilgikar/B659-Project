Preheat oven to 450°F. Combine scallops, olive oil, white wine, chopped shallot and tarragon in medium bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Mix to blend. Divide mixture between 2 small gratin dishes. Sprinkle fresh breadcrumbs over, dividing equally.
Bake until scallops are just cooked through and opaque and crumbs on top are golden, about 15 minutes.

Place salmon on a work surface. Using a sharp, long-bladed knife, cut salmon against the grain into very thin slices. Divide slices evenly among salad plates, arranging flat so they don't overlap. Cover salmon with plastic wrap. Working with one plate at a time, use the flat bottom of a metal 1-cup measuring cup to press down on plastic until salmon spreads out and covers the entire surface of the plate; repeat with remaining plates. Stack plates and chill until cold.
Place arugula in a large bowl; drizzle with lemon juice and 3 Tbsp. oil and toss to coat. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Remove plastic wrap from salmon. Drizzle salmon with remaining 1 Tbsp. oil and season with salt and pepper. Scatter arugula over and serve with lemon wedges alongside for squeezing over.

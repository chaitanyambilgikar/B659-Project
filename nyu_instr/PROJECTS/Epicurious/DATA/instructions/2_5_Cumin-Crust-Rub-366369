In a small, dry frying pan over low heat, toast the cumin, stirring often, until aromatic, about 30 seconds. Pour onto a plate and let cool.
In a small container with a tight-fitting lid, stir together the cumin, paprika, sugar, coriander, cayenne pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper. Cover and shake vigorously to mix. Use right away, or store in a cool, dark place for up to 1 month.

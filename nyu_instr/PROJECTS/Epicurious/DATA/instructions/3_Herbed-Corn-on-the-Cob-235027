Shuck corn, leaving husks attached at base. Discard corn silk. Spread about 3/4 tablespoon butter over each cob, then lay 3 thyme sprigs against each cob, pressing them gently into butter. Pull husks back up over corn. Remove 3 pieces of husk and tear into 12 strips total. Tie top of each husk closed with a strip, then let stand 1 hour (for flavors to develop).
Bring 1 inch of water to a boil in pot (see cooks' note, below), then stand 4 to 6 ears of corn in pot (depending on size of pot), tied ends up, and steam, covered, moving outer ears to inside once with tongs, until crisp-tender, about 6 minutes. Steam remaining corn, in batches if necessary, in same manner, adding water as necessary. Serve with salt and additional butter on the side.

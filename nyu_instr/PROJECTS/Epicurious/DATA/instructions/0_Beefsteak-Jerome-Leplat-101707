Prepare your favorite Sauce Hollandaise , and when it is thickened add the lemon, tomato purée, pepper, and Worcestershire sauce.
Just before serving add 1/4 cup of finely chopped parsley. (These amounts are for 1 cup of Hollandaise.)
Broil steak in your favorite manner, slice it diagonally and bathe the slices in the sauce.

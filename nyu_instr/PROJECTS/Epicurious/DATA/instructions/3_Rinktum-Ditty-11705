In a heavy saucepan melt the butter over moderately low heat, add the flour, and cook the roux, whisking, for 2 minutes. Whisk in the tomato juice, the Sherry, the sugar, and the mustard, bring the mixture to a boil, whisking, and simmer it for 1 minute. Remove the pan from the heat, add the Cheddar gradually, whisking, and heat the mixture over low heat, whisking, until the cheese is melted. Divide the toast between 2 plates, spoon the sauce over it, and sprinkle each serving with the egg.

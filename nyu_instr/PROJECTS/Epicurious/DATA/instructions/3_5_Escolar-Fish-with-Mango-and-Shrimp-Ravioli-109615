Lay 16 mango rounds on a greased baking sheet and sprinkle with sugar, about 1/2 tablespoon per slice. Broil until sugar melts and browns, about 6 to 7 minutes.
Divide other 16 mango rounds among 4 plates, lining up 4 rounds on one side of each plate. Spread 1 tablespoon cream cheese mixture on each mango slice. Lay 1 cooked shrimp on top of each. Top each ravioli with 1 caramelized mango slice, sugar side up.

Place 4 fish pieces in a vertical line on each plate, each piece opposite a mango ravioli. Spoon a little salsa marina over each piece of fish. Drizzle 4 horizontal lines of passion fruit-aji sauce across each plate, one line across each row of fish and ravioli. Remove toothpicks from carrot spirals. Arrange 4 spirals in a vertical line down the center of each plate, between fish and ravioli. Sprinkle plates with sea salt and chives, and serve.

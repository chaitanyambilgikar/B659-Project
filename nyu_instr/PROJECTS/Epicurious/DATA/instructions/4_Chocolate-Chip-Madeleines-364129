Melt the butter and honey in a small saucepan and simmer until syrupy—about 8 minutes. Pour into a bowl and set aside to cool. Don't worry if the mixture splits slightly.
Using an electric stand or hand-held mixer, whisk the eggs and sugar together for around 8 minutes or until the mixture has tripled in volume.
Fold in the flour then the butter mixture and leave until cold. Stir the chopped chocolate into the cake mixture. Rest in the fridge for a couple of hours.
Preheat the oven to 375°F. Butter and flour the madeleine molds. Put a teaspoonful of mixture into each mold and bake for about 15 minutes or until just firm to the touch and golden brown.
Best served warm.

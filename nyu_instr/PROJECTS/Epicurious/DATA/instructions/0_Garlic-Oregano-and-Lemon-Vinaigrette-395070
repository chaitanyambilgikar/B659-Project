Finely chop 2 garlic cloves, 2 anchovy fillets packed in oil (drained), 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, and a pinch of kosher salt in a mini-processor. Add 1/2 seeded, finely chopped lemon (with peel) and 1/4 cup (loosely packed) fresh oregano leaves; pulse a few times to coarsely chop. Add 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil; process until a coarse purée forms. Season with more salt and fresh lemon juice, if desired. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and chill.

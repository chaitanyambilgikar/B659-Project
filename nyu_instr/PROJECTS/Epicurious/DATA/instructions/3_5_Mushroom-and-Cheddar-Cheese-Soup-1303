Cover porcini with hot water and soak 30 minutes. Drain.
Melt butter in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add shiitake mushrooms and green onions and sauté until tender and beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Add flour and stir 2 minutes. Gradually mix in broth and milk. Add porcini. Bring to simmer, stirring frequently. Reduce heat to low and simmer until thick, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes. Add cheese and stir just until melted. Season with salt and pepper. Garnish with parsley and serve.

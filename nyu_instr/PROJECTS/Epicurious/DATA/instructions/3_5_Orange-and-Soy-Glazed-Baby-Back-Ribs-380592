Place ribs, 1/2 cup soy sauce, 3 minced garlic cloves, 2 teaspoons cumin seeds, and 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes in a large pot; add water to cover completely. Bring to a boil and immediately reduce to a simmer. Cover with lid ajar; cook until ribs are tender, about 2 hours. Drain ribs; set aside for 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat oil in a small saucepan over medium heat; add remaining 3 teaspoons cumin seeds and 2 teaspoons red pepper flakes. Toast lightly until fragrant, about 30 seconds; add remaining 6 minced garlic cloves and white and pale-green scallions. Sauté until just soft, about 2 minutes. Add remaining 1/2 cup soy sauce, orange juice, and honey. Bring to a boil and cook until sauce is thick, 12–15 minutes.
Preheat broiler. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil. Place ribs on prepared sheet; brush with sauce. Broil until sauce bubbles, 2-3 minutes. Turn, brush with additional sauce, and broil until ribs are heated through and sauce is bubbling, 2-3 minutes longer. Transfer to a platter. Drizzle with remaining sauce. Sprinkle dark-green scallions and citrus zest over.

In a large skillet heat the oil over moderately high heat until it is hot but not smoking and in it sauté the bell peppers, stirring for 2 minutes. Add the wine and cook the mixture for 1 minute. Add the scallops, the basil, and the black pepper to taste and cook the mixture, covered, over moderate heat for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the scallops are cooked through.

Put oven rack in lower third of oven and preheat oven to 450°F.
Peel parsnips and halve crosswise. Quarter each half lengthwise, then cut out core and discard. Cut parsnips crosswise into 1/2-inch pieces, then toss with sage, oil, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Transfer to a large shallow baking pan (17 by 11 inches), spreading in 1 layer. Roast until parsnips are tender and lightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes.

Preheat oven to 450°F. Brush large rimmed baking sheet with 1 tablespoon olive oil. Arrange all asparagus on prepared baking sheet. Whisk remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil, shallots, and lemon peel in small bowl to blend; pour over asparagus and toss gently to coat. Spread asparagus in single layer. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Roast until asparagus is tender, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes.
Can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature. If desired, rewarm in 450°F oven 5 minutes before continuing. Add parsley and toss gently. Transfer to platter and serve warm or at room temperature.

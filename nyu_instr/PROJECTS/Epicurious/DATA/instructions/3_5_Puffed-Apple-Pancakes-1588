Preheat oven to 425°F. Place four 1-cup ramekins or custard cups on cookie sheet. Pour 1 tablespoon butter into each ramekin. Combine eggs, milk and flour and stir until just blended. Divide batter among ramekins. Toss apple slices with sugar and lemon juice until coated. Arrange apple slices in spoke pattern over batter. Bake until pancakes are puffed and golden, 15 minutes. Serve with syrup.

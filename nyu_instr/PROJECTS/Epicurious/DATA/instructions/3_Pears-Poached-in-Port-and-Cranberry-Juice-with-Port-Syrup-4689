Combine first 5 ingredients in heavy medium saucepan. Bring to boil, stirring twice. Reduce heat to medium; simmer 5 minutes. Add pear halves to liquid. Simmer pears uncovered until tender, turning occasionally, about 20 minutes.
Using slotted spoon, transfer pears to large bowl. Boil cooking liquid until reduced to thin syrup (about 1 1/4 cups), about 15 minutes. Pour syrup over pears in bowl. Cool to room temperature. Cover and chill until cold, about 4 hours. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Keep chilled.)
Mix yogurt and powdered sugar in small bowl. Spoon cold syrup onto plates. Place 1 pear half, flat side down, on each plate. Spoon yogurt mixture over pears. Garnish with mint, if desired, and serve.

Wash spinach thoroughly and cook, without water, in a kettle (the moisture left on the leaves in enough). Steam gently until wilted and still a bit bitey. This will only take a minute. If you use frozen spinach, be careful not to cook it too long. Drain spinach thoroughly, pressing out all excess moisture. Chop coarsely and mix with butter, salt, nutmeg, bacon, and mushrooms. Sprinkle with flour and blend in Madeira and heavy cream. Reheat slighly until just heated through, heap in a serving dish and top with a good dollop of butter and sprinkle with chopped parsley.

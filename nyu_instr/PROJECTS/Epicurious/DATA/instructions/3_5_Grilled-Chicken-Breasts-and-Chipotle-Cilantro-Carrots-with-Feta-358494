Place chicken between 2 sheets of plastic wrap; pound with meat mallet to 1/2- to 3/4-inch thickness. Place chicken in 11 x 7 x 2-inch glass baking dish. Drizzle with 4 tablespoons olive oil. Sprinkle with oregano, 2 teaspoons lemon peel, garlic, and pepper. Turn to coat. Cover and let stand 1 hour at room temperature.
Fill large bowl halfway with ice cubes and water. Cook carrots in boiling salted water until crisp-tender, about 2 minutes. Drain. Immediately place carrots in bowl of ice water to cool. Drain carrots; pat dry.
Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Toss carrots, 1 tablespoon oil, and chipotle chiles in large bowl; sprinkle lightly with coarse salt. Place chicken, skin side down, on grill, along with carrots. Grill chicken until cooked through, 5 to 6 minutes per side. Grill carrots until tender and grill marks appear, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to cutting board. Transfer carrots to large bowl. Drizzle carrots with remaining 1 tablespoon oil, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, and honey. Add cilantro and remaining 1 teaspoon lemon peel; toss to coat. Season with coarse salt and freshly ground black pepper. Slice chicken on diagonal. Arrange on platter, surround with grilled carrots, and sprinkle with crumbled feta. Drizzle remaining 1 tablespoon lemon juice over and serve.

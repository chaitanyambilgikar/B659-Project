Toss two 15-ounce cans chickpeas (rinsed, patted very dry) with 3 coarsely chopped bacon slices and 2 bay leaves on a rimmed baking sheet; season with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Roast at 375°F, stirring occasionally, until chickpeas are crunchy, 60-70 minutes. Toss with a spoonful of seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay).

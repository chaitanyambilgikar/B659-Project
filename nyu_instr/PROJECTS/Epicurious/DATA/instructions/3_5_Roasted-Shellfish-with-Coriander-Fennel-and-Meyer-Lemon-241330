Preheat oven to 500°F. Process coriander seeds and fennel seeds in spice grinder or coffee mill until coarsely ground. Place heavy large roasting pan over 2 burners and heat over medium heat. Add ground coriander and fennel seeds and stir 1 minute. Add olive oil, cracked crab, Manila clams, and mussels; stir to coat. Place pan in oven. Roast until crab is heated through and clams and mussels open, stirring occasionally and transferring clams and mussels to platter as they open, about 10 minutes.
Using tongs, transfer crab, clams, and mussels to platter (discard any clams and mussels that do not open); tent with foil to keep warm. Heat same pan over 2 burners over high heat. Add shallots and wine and boil 1 minute. Add lemon juice and boil until sauce thickens slightly, about 2 minutes. Whisk in butter. Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper. Pour sauce over shellfish. Sprinkle with chives and serve.

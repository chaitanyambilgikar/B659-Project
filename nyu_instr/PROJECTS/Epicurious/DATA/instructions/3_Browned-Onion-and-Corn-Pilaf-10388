In a heavy saucepan cook the onion and the corn in the butter over moderately high heat, stirring, until the vegetables are browned. Add the rice, stir the mixture until the rice is coated with the butter, and stir in 1 cup water and the salt. Bring the liquid to a boil, stirring, and cook the pilaf, covered, over low heat for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the liquid is absorbed.

Peel potatoes and turnips, then cut into 2-inch pieces. Cover potatoes, turnips, and 2 teaspoons salt by 2 inches cold water in a 6-quart pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, until potatoes are tender, 15 to 18 minutes.
While vegetables cook, melt 3 tablespoons butter in a 10-inch heavy skillet (preferably cast-iron), then toast bread crumbs with remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, stirring frequently, until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Add horseradish and toss until combined well, then transfer to a small bowl.
Drain vegetables in a colander, then return to pot and mash. Stir in milk, remaining 4 tablespoons butter, and scallion greens over low heat until combined well and heated through. Season with salt and pepper, then serve topped with bread crumbs.

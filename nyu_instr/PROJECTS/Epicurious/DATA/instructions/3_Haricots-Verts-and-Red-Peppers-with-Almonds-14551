Preheat oven to 350°F.
In a baking pan toast almonds in one layer in middle of oven 10 to 15 minutes, or until lightly colored. Cut bell peppers into 2-inch-long strips. In a 12-inch heavy skillet heat 1 tablespoon oil over moderate heat until hot but not smoking and cook half of peppers, stirring frequently, until crisp-tender, about 12 minutes. Transfer cooked peppers to a serving bowl. Cook remaining peppers in remaining tablespoon oil in same manner and transfer to bowl.
In a 4-quart kettle half filled with boiling salted water cook beans until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes for haricots verts or about 6 minutes for regular green beans. Drain beans in a colander and transfer to bowl. Toss vegetables with almonds and salt and pepper to taste.

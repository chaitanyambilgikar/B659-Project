Pick over black-eyed peas and rinse. In a 5-quart kettle simmer peas with bay leaf in water to cover by 2 inches until tender, 25 to 30 minutes, and remove kettle from heat. Stir in salt and let peas stand 5 minutes. Drain peas in a colander and discard bay leaf.
While peas are simmering, finely chop bell peppers and onion and mince garlic. In a large bowl whisk together vinegar and oil until combined well and stir in hot peas, bell pepper, onion, garlic, and salt and pepper to taste. Peas may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered. Bring peas to room temperature before serving. Just before serving, stir parsley into peas.

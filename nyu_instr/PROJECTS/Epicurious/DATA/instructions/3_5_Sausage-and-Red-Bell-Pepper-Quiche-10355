In a bowl blend together the flour, the butter, the shortening, and a pinch of salt until the mixture resembles meal, add 1 1/2 tablespoons ice water, and toss the mixture until the water is incorporated, adding more water if necessary to form the dough into a ball. Pat the dough into 7 1/2-inch tart pan with a removable rim and bake the shell in the bottom third of a preheated 425°F. oven for 7 minutes, or until it is just golden.
While the shell is baking, in a large skillet cook the sausage with the bell peppers, covered, over moderately high heat, stirring and breaking up any lumps, for 7 minutes, or until the sausage is no longer pink and the bell peppers are soft, and drain the mixture, discarding the excess fat. Transfer the mixture to a bowl, stir in the remaining salt, the Cheddar, and the Parmesan, and spread the mixture in the bottom of the shell. In a bowl whisk together the eggs, the cream, and the milk, pour the egg mixture over the sausage mixture, and bake the quiche on a baking sheet in the middle of a preheated 425°F. oven for 15 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 350°F. and bake the quiche for 10 minutes more.

Preheat oven to 350°F. and grease and flour a 9-inch square baking pan, knocking out excess flour.
Into a bowl sift together flour, baking soda, spices, and salt. In another bowl with an electric mixer beat together oil and sugar until combined and beat in egg and molasses until combined well. Gradually beat in flour mixture until combined and add water, beating until smooth.
Pour batter into pan and bake in middle of oven 30 minutes, or until a tester comes out clean. Cool gingerbread in pan on a rack 10 minutes. Run a thin knife around edge of pan and invert gingerbread onto rack to cool completely.
Serve gingerbread with whipped cream.

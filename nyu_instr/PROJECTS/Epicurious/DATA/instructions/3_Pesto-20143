Blend all ingredients in a blender, or pound in a mortar until they form a soft paste. The amount of oil used depends on the method. If you use the blender, it is best to make the pesto in two batches, using enough oil each time to cover the blades of the blender — about 1/2 cup. In the mortar method, add the oil a little at a time, until the paste has reached the proper consistency. It should not be too runny.
To store unused portion of pesto, place in a jar and cover the surface with a film of olive oil. Wrap in foil or plastic wrap. Keep in refrigerator or freeze.

Discard any bruised or wilted outer leaves from bok choy, then cut leaves from stalks, keeping leaves and stalks separate. Thinly slice leaves and cut stalks diagonally into 1/2-inch-wide slices. Halve carrot lengthwise and cut diagonally into 1/4-inch-thick slices.
Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a 4- to 5-quart heavy pot over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then stir-fry bok choy stalks, carrot, and ginger 1 minute. Stir in Sherry, broth, and sugar and simmer, covered, 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, cut scallions crosswise into 2-inch pieces, then halve lengthwise and cut into very thin matchsticks.
Add bok choy leaves and scallions to carrot mixture and simmer, covered, until vegetables are tender, 3 to 5 minutes.
While vegetables simmer, pat fish dry and sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Stir together cornstarch and curry powder, then rub into skin of each fillet. Halve each fillet diagonally with a sharp knife.
Stir sesame oil, remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper into vegetable mixture and keep warm, uncovered, on turned-off burner.
Heat remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then cook fish, skin sides down, gently pressing occasionally with a metal spatula (to keep skin flat), until skin is golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn fish over and cook until just cooked through, about 2 minutes more. Remove from heat.
Divide broth and vegetables among 4 shallow bowls and stack 2 fish halves, skin sides up, in center of each bowl.

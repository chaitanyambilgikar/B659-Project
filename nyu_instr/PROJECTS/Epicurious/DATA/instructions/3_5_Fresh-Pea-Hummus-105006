Make pita toasts: Preheat oven to 375°F.
Combine garlic and oil in a small cup and let stand while oven heats.
Brush garlic oil on 1 side of each pita. Arrange pitas, oiled sides up, in 1 layer on a large baking sheet. Bake in middle of oven until toasted, 12 to 15 minutes (pitas will not be completely crisp). Stack pitas while still warm and cut each into 6 triangles (24 total). Cool, then transfer to a plate or basket to serve with hummus.
Make hummus while pitas toast: Cook peas in a saucepan of boiling salted water until just tender, 6 to 10 minutes. Drain and cool.
Coarsely grind cumin seeds in an electric coffee/spice grinder or crush with a mortar and pestle. Transfer to a food processor. Add cilantro and garlic (to taste) and finely chop.
Add peas, tahini, lemon juice, salt, and pepper and purée.

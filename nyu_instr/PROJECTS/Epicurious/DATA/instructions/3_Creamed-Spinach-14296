In a large saucepan of boiling salted water cook spinach 2 minutes and drain in a sieve, using the back of a large spoon to press as much water as possible out of spinach.
In a skillet cook onion in butter over moderate heat, stirring, until softened. Stir in spinach, cream, pepper, nutmeg, and salt to taste and cook until most of cream is absorbed, about 3 minutes.

Bring 5 cups water to simmer in medium saucepan. Cover; keep warm over low heat. Pour 5 cups water into large pot. Add salt, oil, and bay leaves; bring to boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium; gradually add cornmeal, whisking to avoid lumps. Reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer uncovered until polenta is thick, whisking often, about 3 minutes. Whisk in 1 cup of reserved hot water. Continue to simmer until polenta is smooth and thick, whisking often, about 3 minutes. Add remaining hot water, 1 cup at a time, and cook until very thick after each addition, whisking often, about 20 minutes.
*Available at Italian markets, natural foods stores, and some supermarkets. If unavailable, substitute regular yellow cornmeal and cook for about half the time.

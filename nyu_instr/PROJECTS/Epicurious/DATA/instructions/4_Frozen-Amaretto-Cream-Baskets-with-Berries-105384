Line baking pan with foil. Using electric mixer, beat cream cheese in medium bowl until smooth. Beat in 1/2 cup sugar, then amaretto. Using same beaters, beat cream in large bowl until peaks form. Fold cream into cheese mixture in 2 additions. Drop cheese mixture in 6 mounds into prepared pan. Using back of spoon, make depression in center of each mound, pressing to form 3- to 4-inch-diameter baskets. Freeze baskets until firm, about 2 hours, or cover and keep frozen up to 3 days.
Combine strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, and remaining 1/4 cup sugar in medium bowl. Toss to blend. Let stand to release juices, tossing occasionally, about 30 minutes.
Place 1 basket on each of 6 plates. Spoon berries and juices into each.

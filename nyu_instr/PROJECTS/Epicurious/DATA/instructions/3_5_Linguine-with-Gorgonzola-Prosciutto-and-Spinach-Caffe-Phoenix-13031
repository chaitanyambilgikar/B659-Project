In a 6-quart kettle bring 5 quarts salted water to a boil for linguine.
Cut half of spinach leaves into thin strips and reserve remaining whole leaves.
In a large heavy skillet cook prosciutto, garlic, basil, and oregano in 1/2 cup oil over moderately high heat, stirring, until lightly browned, about 3 minutes.
Add pasta to boiling water and cook until al dente. Drain in a colander. Return pasta to kettle and toss with remaining 1/4 cup oil, prosciutto mixture, cut spinach, and Gorgonzola. Season pasta with salt and pepper.
Arrange reserved spinach leaves on 4 plates. Mound pasta on spinach and sprinkle with pine nuts. Garnish pasta with basil leaves and serve with Parmesan.

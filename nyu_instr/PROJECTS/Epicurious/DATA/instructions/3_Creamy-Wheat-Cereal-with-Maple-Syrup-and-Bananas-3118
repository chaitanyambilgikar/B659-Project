Chop enough banana to equal 1 cup. Slice remaining banana and reserve.
Combine 2 cups water, nonfat milk and salt in heavy large saucepan. Bring mixture to boil. Gradually whisk in cream of wheat. Continue to whisk constantly until mixture thickens, about 4 minutes. Stir maple syrup and chopped banana into cereal.
Divide cereal among 4 bowls. Garnish each serving with reserved sliced banana, dried banana chips and toasted almonds and serve.

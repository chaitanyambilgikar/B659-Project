Preheat oven to 325°F. and have ready an ungreased 10-inch tube pan (about 4 inched deep) with a removable bottom.
In a small bowl whisk together flour, cocoa powder, and 1/2 cup sugar. In a large bowl with an electric mixer beat whites with salt on medium speed until white, opaque, and beginning to hold their shape. Gradually add the remaining 3/4 cup sugar, beating at high speed until whites hold soft (not stiff), slightly glossy peaks. Beat in vanilla.
Sift one third cocoa mixture over whites and fold in gently but thoroughly, scraping bottom of bowl to prevent lumps. Sift and fold in remaining cocoa mixture, half at a time, in same manner and pour batter into pan. With a knife, make series of side by side chops in batter to remove air bubbles and smooth top. Bake cake in middle of oven 40 to 45 minutes, or until firm to the touch. Invert cake over neck of a bottle and cool completely.
Run a thin knife around edge of cake and remove side of pan. Run knife under bottom of cake and around center tube to loosen cake and invert cake onto a rack.
While orange glaze is still warm, quickly pour over cake, spreading evenly over top with a spatula and allowing excess to drip down outside. (Alternatively, spoon glaze into a plastic bag and squeeze into one corner. Snip off corner to make small hole in bag and streak glaze over cake from center outward.)
While glaze is still wet (to avoid cracking), transfer cake to a platter. When glaze is set, cover cake loosely with plastic wrap or place under a cake dome and keep at room temperature until ready to serve.
If cake is kept more than 1 day (before or after serving), it should be wrapped in plastic wrap and frozen. Bring cake to room temperature before serving.

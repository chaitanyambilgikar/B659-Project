1. Place the flour, salt and sugar in a food processor; pulse on and off to mix. Add the butter and shortening, then pulse the machine on and off until the mixture resembles coarse meal.
2. Add the water through the feed tube, pulsing on and off, until the dough gathers together in the side of the work bowl. Remove dough and form it into a disk. Wrap it in plastic and chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour.
3. Divide the dough in half. Roll out half on a floured work surface (or between 2 sheets of waxed paper) into an 1/8-inch thick round large enough to fit your pie pan. It should be about 1 1/2 to 2 inches larger than the pie pan. Work quickly, as the dough can get sticky. Repeat with remaining dough for a top crust.
4. Preheat the oven to 400° F.
5. In a saucepan, mix together the cherries, sugar, flour and almond extract. Bring to a boil. Boil for 1 minute, stirring. Cool to room temperature.
6. Line a 9-inch pie pan with half of the pie dough. Brush the bottom crust with egg white. Spoon the cooled cherry filling into the crust. Cover with the top crust. Trim the excess dough, leaving a 1-inch overhang. Moisten the rims of the crusts where they meet with water, then turn the top crust under the bottom and crimp the edges decoratively. Cut a few slits in the top to allow the steam to escape.
7. Bake the pie in the center of the oven for 35 minutes or until the crust is golden brown.

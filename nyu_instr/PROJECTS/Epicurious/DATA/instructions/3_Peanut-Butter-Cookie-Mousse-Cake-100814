Make peanut butter mousse: Crush cookies in food processor and set aside.
Soften cream cheese, add peanut butter, and mix well. Add powdered sugar. Whip cream until soft peaks form. Fold whipped cream into peanut mixture and set aside.
Make ganache: Place chocolate chips in bowl and set aside. Heat heavy cream until it starts to boil. Pour over chips and stir.
Assembly: Use an 8-inch springform pan. As a first layer, spread half of the cookie crumbs on bottom, then pour on a thin layer (about 1/3) of ganache, enough just to hold cookie crumbs. Place half of the peanut butter mousse in the pan and spread over the ganache. Place the remaining cookie crumbs on top of the mousse. Place a third of the chocolate on top of the mousse. Place remaining mousse in pan, and finish cake with remaining ganache. Place in freezer for one hour. Remove from freezer, take out of pan, and serve.

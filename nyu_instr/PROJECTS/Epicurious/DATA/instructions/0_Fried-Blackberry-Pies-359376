For dough: Whisk flour, sugar, and salt in medium bowl. Add shortening. Using fingertips, blend until coarse meal forms. Add 6 tablespoons ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing with fork until moist clumps form and adding more water by tablespoonfuls if dry. Gather into ball; form into disk. Wrap in plastic; chill 2 hours.
Roll out dough on lightly floured surface to 14-inch round. Using 6- to 7-inch round plate as guide, cut out 2 rounds. Gather remaining dough into ball. Roll out dough and cut out more rounds, gathering scraps and rerolling as needed for total of 6 rounds. Transfer rounds to rimmed baking sheet, layering between sheets of waxed paper. Cover and chill 1 hour. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Keep chilled.
For filling: Mix berries, sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, and salt in large bowl. Let stand 5 minutes; stir again.
Place 1 dough round on lightly floured surface. Brush with egg glaze. Spoon 1/2 cup berry mixture into center; fold sides of crust over filling, pinching tightly to seal. Repeat with remaining dough rounds and filling.
Add enough oil to heavy large saucepan to reach depth of 2 1/2 inches. Attach deep-fry thermometer. Heat oil to 330°F to 340°F. Cook pies, 2 at a time, until deep golden brown, 7 to 8 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Dust with powdered sugar. Serve warm with ice cream.Adapted from Lamberts Downtown Barbecue

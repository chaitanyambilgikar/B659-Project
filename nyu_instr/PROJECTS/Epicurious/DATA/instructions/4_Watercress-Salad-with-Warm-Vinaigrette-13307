In a small saucepan whisk together the shallot, the mustard, the honey, the vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste, add the oil in a stream, whisking, and whisk the dressing until it is emulsified. Heat the dressing over moderately low heat, whisking occasionally, until it is hot and in a bowl toss it with the watercress.

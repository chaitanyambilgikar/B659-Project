Make shrimp With a sharp knife cut a slice from top and bottom of each orange, exposing flesh, and arrange with a cut side down on a cutting board. Cutting from top to bottom, remove peel and pith. Working over a bowl, cut orange sections free from membranes, letting sections drop into bowl, and squeeze in excess juice from membranes.
Into a large saucepan of boiling salted water plunge shrimp and poach at a bare simmer just until firm, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain shrimp in a colander and transfer to a large bowl. While shrimp are still warm add oil, garlic, and 1 tablespoon juice from orange sections, stirring to coat shrimp. Let shrimp cool to room temperature.
Make sauce: In a small bowl whisk together sauce ingredients until smooth. Sauce may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.
Quarter avocados lengthwise, removing pit and peel, and cut into 1/2-inch dice. Transfer orange sections with a slotted spoon to shrimp mixture and add hearts of palm and avocado, folding ingredients together gently.
Divide salad among 4 plates, mounding it, and spoon sauce over salad.

Preheat oven to 300°F. Brush 9-inch-diameter springform pan with 1 tablespoon melted butter. Finely grind crackers in processor. Mix cracker crumbs, Parmesan and 5 tablespoons melted butter in medium bowl to blend. Reserve 1/2 cup crumb mixture for topping; press remainder onto bottom and up sides of prepared pan. Refrigerate while preparing filling.
Using electric mixer, beat cream cheese and eggs in large bowl until smooth. Mix in remaining ingredients. Pour filling into crust. Sprinkle reserved 1/2 cup crumbs over. Place cheesecake on rimmed baking sheet. Bake until filling no longer moves in center when pan is gently shaken, about 2 hours. Cool 30 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Let stand 2 hours at room temperature before serving.)

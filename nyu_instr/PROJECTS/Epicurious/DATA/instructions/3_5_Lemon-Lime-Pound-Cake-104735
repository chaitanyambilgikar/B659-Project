Preheat oven to 325°F. Spray 12-cup Bundt pan with nonstick spray. Whisk flour and salt in bowl to blend. Using electric mixer, beat butter in large bowl until fluffy. Gradually beat in sugar. Beat in eggs, 1 at a time; then beat in 1 teaspoon each lemon peel and lime peel. Beat in flour mixture in 4 additions alternately with 3/4 cup lemon-lime soda in 3 additions. Transfer batter to prepared pan.
Bake cake until golden on top and tester inserted near center comes out clean, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Cool cake in pan 5 minutes. Turn cake out onto rack and cool completely. Combine powdered sugar and remaining 1/2 teaspoon each lemon peel and lime peel in bowl. Whisk in enough of remaining 2 tablespoons soda to form thick smooth icing. Drizzle icing over cake.

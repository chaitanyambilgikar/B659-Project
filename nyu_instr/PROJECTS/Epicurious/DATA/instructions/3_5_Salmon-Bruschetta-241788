Fill a large saucepan with water. Bring to a rolling boil. Remove from heat, add salmon and salt and cover. Let stand until salmon is no longer translucent in the center but still dark pink and tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove salmon and discard skin. Transfer to a bowl and break up with a fork. Add beans, tomato, carrot, garlic, basil, vinegar, oil and pepper. Stir to combine. Separate into 2 small plastic containers. (Salmon will keep for up to 2 days.) Bring 1 container and 8 crackers for lunch. Spoon onto crackers right before eating.

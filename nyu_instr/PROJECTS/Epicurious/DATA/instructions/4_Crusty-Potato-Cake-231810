Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 400°F.
Melt fat and butter in cast-iron skillet over low heat. Remove from heat and pour into a large bowl. Do not wipe skillet.
Mix salt and pepper in a small bowl. Peel potatoes and, working over bowl of fat, cut crosswise into 1/16-inch-thick slices, letting them fall into fat, then toss to coat. Arrange one third of potatoes in 1 layer in skillet in overlapping concentric circles. Sprinkle with one third of salt mixture, then make 2 more layers of potatoes in same manner, seasoning each layer with one third of salt mixture. If there is any fat remaining in bowl, scrape onto potatoes.
Cook potatoes over moderate heat 15 minutes. Press down on potatoes with a wide metal spatula, then cover surface with parchment paper and cover skillet with foil.
Bake until outside edge is golden brown and potatoes in center are tender when pierced with a fork, about 25 minutes. Let stand, covered, at room temperature 5 minutes, then carefully loosen edge with a heatproof flexible spatula. Invert a plate with a rim over skillet. Using pot holders and holding plate and skillet together firmly, invert skillet. Remove skillet and sprinkle potato cake with parsley and garlic.

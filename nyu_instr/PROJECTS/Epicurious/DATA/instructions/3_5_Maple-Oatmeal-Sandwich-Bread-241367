Place all ingredients, in order listed, into large bowl of heavy-duty mixer fitted with dough hook. Beat at low speed until dough is smooth, comes cleanly from sides, and climbs hook, adding more flour by 1/4 cupfuls if dough is very sticky, about 8 minutes. Scrape dough from hook. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and towel. Let rise in warm draft-free area until doubled in volume, about 1 1/2 hours.
Butter 9x5x3-inch metal loaf pan. Butter sheet of plastic wrap. Scrape dough onto lightly floured surface. Knead until smooth, about 2 minutes. Shape into 8x3-inch log. Place in prepared pan; cover loosely with prepared plastic wrap, buttered side down. Let dough rise in warm draft-free area until center is 1 1/2 inches higher than pan, about 45 minutes. Preheat oven to 350°F. Gently pull plastic off dough. Place bread in oven; bake until deep golden and instant-read thermometer inserted into center registers 180°F, about 30 minutes. Cool in pan 15 minutes. Run small knife around bread; turn out of pan. Cool completely on rack. DO AHEAD: Can be made 4 days ahead. Wrap in foil; store at room temperature.

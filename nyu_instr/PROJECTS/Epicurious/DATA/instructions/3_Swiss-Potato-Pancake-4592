Cook potatoes in pot of boiling salted water until just tender. Drain. Peel potatoes and cut lengthwise into quarters; refrigerate until cold, about 20 minutes.
Coarsely grate cold potatoes into large bowl. Sprinkle with salt and pepper; toss to blend. Melt butter with oil in heavy medium nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add potatoes to skillet. Sauté until potatoes begin to color, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Using metal spatula, press potatoes firmly into flat pancake (about 1/2 inch thick). Reduce heat to low and cook without stirring until pancake is brown and crisp on bottom, about 12 minutes. Slide pancake out onto large plate. Cut into wedges. Place on plates, browned side up. Sprinkle with parsley.

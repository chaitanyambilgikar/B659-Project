Whisk together egg and granulated sugar, then whisk in zest, juice, ricotta, flour, and salt until just combined. Heat oil in a 10-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking. Working in batches of 4, spoon 1 tablespoon of batter per fritter into oil and fry, turning over once, until golden on both sides, about 2 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain and cool slightly.
Dust fritters with confectioners sugar and serve immediately.

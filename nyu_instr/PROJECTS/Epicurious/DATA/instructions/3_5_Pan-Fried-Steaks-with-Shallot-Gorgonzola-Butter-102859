Using fork, mix 4 tablespoons butter, Gorgonzola cheese, shallots and chives in small bowl until well blended. Season with salt and pepper. Divide mixture into 8 equal pieces; form into balls. Cover and refrigerate until cold. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Keep refrigerated.)
Melt 1 tablespoon butter in each of 2 heavy large skillets over high heat. Sprinkle steaks with salt and pepper. Add 2 steaks to each skillet and cook to desired doneness, about 3 minutes per side for medium-rare. Transfer steaks to plates. Top each with 2 balls of shallot-Gorgonzola butter and serve.

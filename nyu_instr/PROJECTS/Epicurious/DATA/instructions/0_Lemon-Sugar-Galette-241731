Preheat oven to 500°F with rack in upper third.
Roll out dough into a 15- by 12-inch rectangle on a lightly floured surface with a floured rolling pin. Transfer to a buttered 17- by 13-inch baking sheet and stretch to edges. Let stand 10 minutes.
Brush dough with butter, then stir together sugar and zest and sprinkle over dough. Bake, rotating sheet halfway through baking, until golden in spots and crisp, 7 to 10 minutes. Break into pieces.

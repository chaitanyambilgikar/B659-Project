For dough: Stir 1/2 cup lukewarm water and yeast in large bowl to blend. Whisk in lukewarm milk, melted butter, sugar and salt, then eggs. Add enough flour, 1/2 cup at a time, to form smooth but very sticky dough, stirring vigorously with wood spoon. Butter large bowl. Transfer dough to bowl; turn to coat with butter. Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Refrigerate overnight (do not punch down dough).
For streusel: Mix brown sugar, pecans and cinnamon in 4-cup measuring cup. Stir in melted butter; set aside.
Butter 15x10x2-inch glass baking dish. Set aside 2 cups streusel; cover bottom of dish with remaining streusel. Turn dough out onto generously floured surface, scraping bowl with rubber spatula if dough sticks (do not punch down dough). Sprinkle dough lightly with flour. Roll out dough to 14-inch square. Sprinkle reserved 2 cups streusel over dough, leaving 3/4-inch plain border on all sides. Roll up jelly-roll style, enclosing streusel completely. Cut rolled dough crosswise in half, then cut each half crosswise into 7 rounds, each about 1 inch thick. Place rounds cut side down and evenly spaced atop streusel in dish (rounds will not cover streusel completely).
Cover dish loosely with plastic wrap. Let dough rise in warm draft-free area until rounds are puffed and almost touching, about 45 minutes.
Meanwhile, position rack in center of oven and preheat to 400°F. Bake buns 10 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 375°F. Continue to bake buns until golden brown, about 20 minutes longer.
Immediately place large baking sheet atop dish with buns. Invert buns onto baking sheet. Cool at least 30 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.

Combine milk, brown sugar, butter, and salt in a 3-quart heavy saucepan and bring just to a boil over moderate heat, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring frequently, until mixture registers 238°F on thermometer and a teaspoon of mixture dropped into a small bowl of cold water holds a soft ball when pressed between your fingers (this will take about 30 minutes).
Transfer to a heatproof bowl. Beat in vanilla with an electric mixer at medium speed, then add confectioners' sugar a little at a time, beating until fudge is thick and smooth, about 5 minutes.
Spread evenly in an ungreased 8-inch square baking pan. Refrigerate, uncovered, until firm enough to cut, about 30 minutes.
Cut fudge into 64 squares with a sharp paring knife.

Sift flour and salt into medium bowl. Using electric mixer, beat butter and brown sugar in large bowl until light. Beat in egg. Add flour mixture and beat until well blended. Stir in walnuts.
Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface. Divide dough in half. Roll each half into 8-inch-long, 1 1/2-inch-wide log. Wrap each log in waxed paper and freeze until firm, about 30 minutes, or refrigerate up to 2 days.
Preheat oven to 350°F. Cut dough logs crosswise into 1/3-inch-thick rounds. Place rounds 1 inch apart on 2 ungreased baking sheets. Bake until cookies are light golden around edges, about 15 minutes. Transfer to racks and cool 10 minutes. Place powdered sugar in shallow dish. Turn cookies in powdered sugar to coat completely. Cool on racks. (Can be prepared 3 days ahead. Store in airtight container.)

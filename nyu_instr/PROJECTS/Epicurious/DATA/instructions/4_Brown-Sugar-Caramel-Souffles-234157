Preheat oven to 400°F. Butter eight 3/4-cup soufflé dishes; sprinkle with brown sugar. Place on rimmed baking sheet. Melt butter in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat; add 1 cup brown sugar, cream, vanilla, and salt; stir until sugar dissolves. Cool slightly. Pour 1/2 cup caramel into small bowl; reserve for sauce.
Add egg yolks and flour to remaining caramel in saucepan; whisk constantly over medium heat until mixture thickens, about 3 minutes. Cool 15 minutes. Using electric mixer, beat egg whites in large bowl until foamy, then gradually beat in 2 tablespoons brown sugar until whites are stiff but not dry. Fold 1/3 of whites into caramel mixture in saucepan. Fold caramel mixture into whites until incorporated. Divide mixture among prepared dishes. Sprinkle lightly with brown sugar. Bake until soufflés are puffed and golden brown, about 11 minutes. Serve immediately with reserved caramel sauce.

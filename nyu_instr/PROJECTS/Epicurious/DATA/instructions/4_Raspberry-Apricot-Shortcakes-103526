Place apricots in large bowl. Combine 1 cup sugar and 1 cup water in small saucepan. Bring to boil, stirring until sugar dissolves. Mix sugar syrup into apricots. Cool completely.
Place 1 tablespoon water in small cup. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon unflavored gelatin over. Let stand until gelatin softens, about 5 minutes. Set cup in 1-inch-deep simmering water in medium saucepan; stir until gelatin dissolves, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat. Using electric mixer, beat whipping cream and powdered sugar in large bowl just until mixture thickens. Gradually add warm gelatin mixture, beating until cream forms medium-firm peaks. (Apricots and whipped cream can be prepared 8 hours ahead. Cover separately and refrigerate.)
Cut biscuits horizontally in half. Place 1 biscuit bottom in each of 10 shallow bowls. Spoon apricots with some syrup over bottoms. Top with whipped cream, raspberries and biscuit tops. Drizzle remaining syrup from apricots around shortcakes and serve.

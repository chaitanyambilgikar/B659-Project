Cut the tofu into 1 1/2 by 3/4-inch pieces and place on a cloth to dry. Put enough oil in a wok to deep-fry the tofu and heat to 350°F, or until a cube of bread dropped in the oil browns in 15 seconds. Deep-fry the tofu for about 5 minutes, or until it is golden and very crisp. Once all of the tofu is cooked, remove the oil from the wok and reserve for later use.
Place 2 teaspoons of oil back into the wok and place over high heat. Add the scallions, chile, and garlic, stir-fry for 30 seconds, then return the tofu to the wok. Toss to combine the flavors and season with the salt and pepper seasoning mix. Serve with salt, pepper, and lemon dipping sauce or vegetarian dipping sauce .

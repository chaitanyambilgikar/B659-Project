Preheat oven to 375°F. and butter a 13 x 9-inch glass baking dish.
Make filling: Cut enough rhubarb crosswise into 1/4-inch slices to measure 6 cups and arrange in one layer in baking dish. Bake rhubarb, uncovered, in middle of oven, 1 1/4 hours. Transfer hot rhubarb to a bowl and stir in sugar until combined well. Cool filling. Filling may be made 2 days ahead and chilled, covered. Bring filling to room temperature before proceeding.
Reduce temperature to 325°F.
Make custard: In a bowl whisk together yolks and granulated sugar. In a small heavy saucepan heat cream with gingerroot over moderately high heat until it just comes to a simmer. Add cream mixture to egg mixture in a stream, whisking, and skim off any froth.
Divide filling among six 3/4-cup flameproof ramekins and divide custard over filling. Put ramekins in a roasting pan and add enough hot water to pan to reach halfway up sides of ramekins. Loosely cover pan with foil and bake custards in middle of oven until just set but still trembling slightly, about 50 minutes. Remove ramekins from pan and cool custards on a rack. Chill custards, loosely covered with plastic wrap, until cold, at least 4 hours, and up to 2 days.
Just before serving, sprinkle 1 teaspoon turbinado sugar evenly over each custard and caramelize with blowtorch, moving flame evenly back and forth just over sugar (alternatively, broil custards under a preheated broiler set 2 to 3 inches from heat) until sugar is evenly melted and deep golden.

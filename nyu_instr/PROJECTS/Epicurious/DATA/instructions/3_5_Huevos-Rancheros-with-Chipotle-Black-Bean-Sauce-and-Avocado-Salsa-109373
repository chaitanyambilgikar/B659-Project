Stir first 4 ingredients in bowl to blend. Season salsa with salt and pepper.
Preheat oven to 400°F. Spray baking sheet with nonstick spray. Arrange tortillas in single layer on sheet. Bake until tortillas are golden, about 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat 3 teaspoons oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and sauté until golden, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cumin; stir 30 seconds. Stir in tomatoes with juice, beans, and chiles; bring to boil. Reduce heat; simmer until almost all liquid is absorbed, stirring frequently, about 8 minutes. Season to taste with salt.
Heat 1 teaspoon oil in another large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Crack eggs into skillet; fry until whites are just set but yolks are still soft, about 4 minutes. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Place 1 warm tortilla on each of 4 plates. Divide bean mixture among tortillas. Top each with 1 egg; sprinkle with cheese and lettuce. Top with salsa; serve.
*Chipotle chiles canned in a spicy tomato sauce, sometimes called adobo, are available at Latin American markets, specialty foods stores, and some supermarkets.

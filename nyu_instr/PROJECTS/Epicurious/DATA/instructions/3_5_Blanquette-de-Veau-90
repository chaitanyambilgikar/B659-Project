Season veal with salt and pepper. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in heavy large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add veal to Dutch oven in batches and cook until brown, turning occasionally, about 5 minutes per batch. Transfer veal to plate. Add onion and remaining 2 tablespoon butter to Dutch oven and sauté until onion is tender, about 3 minutes. Return veal and any juices on plate to Dutch oven. Sprinkle flour over veal and stir 2 minutes. Pour in wine and bring to boil. Add chicken broth and thyme.
Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 25 minutes.
Mix in carrots and continue simmering until carrots and veal are tender, about 25 minutes. Add cream and boil until liquids are reduced to sauce consistency, about 15 minutes. Stir in peas and bring to boil. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve with rice.

In a large bowl whisk together eggs, sugar, molasses, spices, and salt and add butter mixture in a slow stream, whisking. In a cup dissolve baking soda in warm water and whisk into batter. Sift flour over batter and whisk until combined well. Add boiling water in a slow stream, whisking, and pour batter into baking pan.

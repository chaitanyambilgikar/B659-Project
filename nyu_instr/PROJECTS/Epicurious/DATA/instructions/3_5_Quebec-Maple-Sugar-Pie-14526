On a lightly floured surface with a floured rolling pin roll out dough into a 14-inch round (about 1/8 inch thick). Fit dough into an 11-inch tart pan with a removable fluted rim and trim flush with rim. Chill shell until firm, about 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 425°F.
Lightly prick bottom of shell all over with a fork and line shell with foil. Fill foil with pie weights or rice and bake shell in middle of oven 15 minutes. Carefully remove weights or rice and foil and bake shell until golden, about 8 minutes more. Cool shell in pan on a rack. Shell may be made 1 day ahead and kept in pan, covered, at room temperature.
Reduce temperature to 350°F.
In a bowl whisk together maple sugar and flour. Add cream and whisk until smooth. Pour filling into shell and bake in middle of oven 45 minutes, or until fling is set. Cool pie to warm in pan on rack and remove rim.
Serve pie warm or at room temperature with whipped cream.

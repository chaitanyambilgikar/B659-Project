Add 1/4 cup olive oil, 2 1/2 teaspoons salt and remaining 3/4 cup water to sponge. Using paddle attachment, beat on lowest speed until blended. Gradually add 3 1/4 cups flour, beating until dough comes together, about 5 minutes (dough will be moist and sticky). Cover bowl with plastic wrap and towel. let dough rise in warm draft-free area until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
Brush 2 heavy large baking sheets with oil. Transfer dough to lightly floured surface. Sprinkle with just enough flour to keep dough from sticking. Divide dough into 8 equal pieces. Shape each piece into ball; flatten each ball into disk. Transfer disks to prepared baking sheets. Let rise 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 425°F. With lightly floured fingers, press dough disks all over, dimpling surface. Sprinkle disks with goat cheese, green onions, garlic and crushed red pepper, dividing equally. Drizzle each disk with 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil, then sprinkle with coarse salt. Let rise 15 minutes.

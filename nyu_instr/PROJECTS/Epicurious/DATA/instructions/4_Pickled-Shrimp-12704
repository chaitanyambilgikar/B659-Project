In a bowl whisk together the vinegar, the pepper, the salt, the sugar, the mustard, the red pepper flakes, the mustard seeds, and the coriander seeds and add the oil in a stream, whisking. Whisk the marinade until it is emulsified and stir in the garlic and the bay leaf. In a large saucepan of salted boiling water cook the shrimp for 1 minute, or until they are just cooked through, drain them well, and add them to the marinade. Let the mixture cool, stir in the onion and the lemon, and let the shrimp mixture marinate, covered and chilled, stirring occasionally, for at least 12 hours and up to 1 day. Stir in the minced dill or parsley, transfer the pickled shrimp to a bowl, and garnish it with the dill sprigs.

Whisk 4 tablespoons oil, vinegar, and horseradish in large bowl to blend. Add beets and onion; toss to blend.
Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add cabbage and toss until wilted and just crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Stir into beet mixture. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Let stand 10 minutes before serving, stirring occasionally.
* This vinegar can be found at specialty foods stores. Regular balsamic can be substituted.

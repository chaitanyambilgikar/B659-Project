1. Preheat your oven to 350°F/180°C.
2. Cut the schmaltz into chunks and put it, along with both the sugars, into the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with a paddle. Mix on high until the fat is fluffy, 2 minutes or so.
3. Add the egg, vanilla, cinnamon and mix on low, to incorporate.
4. Combine the salt, flour, and baking powder, and add this to the mixing bowl. Paddle on medium to combine, 30 seconds or so. Add the oats and paddle to combine. Add the garnish and paddle to combine.
5. Shape into golf-ball-sized orbs and put on a cookie sheet. Flatten them to your desired thickness (they won't spread much but they will puff). Bake the cookies until done, about 15 minutes.

With a sharp knife, make a deep incision lengthwise along the thickest part of the meat. Spread the meat apart, and stuff the prunes into this opening. Sprinkle lightly with nutmeg, then press the meat together again and tie securely. Rub with the thyme and salt and pepper. Place on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. Roast in a 325°F. oven allowing about 23-25 minutes per pound, until the internal temperature reaches 165°F. when tested with a meat thermometer. Baste often with the pan juices and some of the wine marinade from the prunes. Serve with crisp sautéed potatoes, a good salad and a rosé wine or chilled champagne.

Make Stroganov: In a bowl toss beef with flour until coated well. In a 10- to 12-inch skillet heat 1 tablespoon oil over moderately high heat and brown beef in batches, transferring beef to plate with slotted spoon or tongs.
Add remaining tablespoon oil to skillet and cook shallots and onion with salt and pepper to taste over moderate heat, stirring, until softened. Add wine and boil until cooking liquid is almost evaporated. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring, until tender and liquid they give off is evaporated. Add broth and simmer 1 minute. Stir in sour cream and Worcestershire sauce. Return beef to skillet and gently simmer, covered, stirring occasionally, 3 to 5 minutes, or until sauce is thickened. Stir in parsley and salt and pepper to taste.
Make purée: Peel turnips and potato and cut into 1-inch pieces. In a 3- to 4-quart saucepan cover turnips and potato with cold water by 1 inch and simmer, covered, until very tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain turnips and potatoes in a colander and in batches force through a ricer or food mill fitted with medium disk into pan. Stir in butter and salt and pepper to taste.
Serve Stroganov with turnip potato purée or noodles.

Sprinkle beef with salt and pepper. Heat oil in large (preferably nonstick) saucepan over medium-high heat. Add beef; sauté until brown on all sides, about 5 minutes. Add onion and sauté until golden, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes with their juices, garlic, cloves, bay leaf and cinnamon stick and bring to boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer 45 minutes.
Mix yams and prunes into stew. Cover and simmer until beef and yams are tender, stirring occasionally, about 45 minutes longer. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Discard cloves, bay leaf and cinnamon stick. Transfer to bowl. Sprinkle with parsley and serve.

Make marinade: Finely chop scallion and in a bowl whisk together with remaining marinade ingredients.
In a large heavy-duty sealable plastic bag combine marinade and steaks, turning steaks to coat with marinade, and seal bag, pressing out excess air. Marinate steaks at room temperature 1 hour.
Make salsa while steaks are marinating: Finely chop nectarine and bell pepper. Seed and finely chop tomatoes. Thinly slice white and pale-green parts of scallions and mince garlic. Wearing protective gloves, discard seeds and ribs from chile and finely chop chile. In a bowl stir together all salsa ingredients and season with salt and pepper.
Prepare grill.
Remove steaks from marinade, discarding it, and grill steaks on an oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals, 3 to 4 minutes on each side for medium-rare. (Alternatively, grill steaks in a hot lightly oiled well-seasoned ridged grill pan over moderately high heat.) Transfer steaks with tongs to a platter and let stand 5 minutes.
Serve steaks with salsa.

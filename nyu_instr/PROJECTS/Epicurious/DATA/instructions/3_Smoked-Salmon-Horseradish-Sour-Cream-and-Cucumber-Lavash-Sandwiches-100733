Halve and seed cucumber. Cut cucumber into sixteen 5-by 1/4-inch-thick sticks. Halve onion lengthwise and cut crosswise into thin slices.
In a small bowl stir together sour cream, capers, horseradish, and salt and pepper to taste.
Quarter lavash and spread 1 side of each quarter evenly with 1 tablespoon sour cream mixture, leaving a 1/2-inch border all around. On each quarter arrange about 1 1/2 slices salmon in one layer over sour cream mixture and spread 1 tablespoon sour cream mixture evenly over salmon. On each quarter arrange 4 cucumber sticks, about 3 onion slices, 4 chives, and one fourth watercress parallel to 1 cut edge and season with salt and pepper. Tightly roll up each lavash around filling into a cone and wrap individually in wax paper and plastic wrap. Sandwiches may be made 6 hours ahead and chilled, wrapped in plastic wrap.
Garnish sandwiches with watercress and chives.

Make dough: Pulse together flour, baking powder, and salt in a food processor until well mixed. Add butter and pulse until mixture resembles coarse meal. (Alternatively, whisk together dry ingredients and cut in butter with a pastry blender.) Transfer to a bowl and stir in yogurt and 1 cup sesame seeds until mixture forms a dough. Divide dough into quarters, wrapping each in plastic wrap. Chill 10 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350°F.
Make glaze: Stir together eggs, sugar, and soy sauce with a fork until sugar is dissolved.
Roll out dough: Divide 1 dough quarter into 12 equal portions and form each into a 4-inch log with your hands. With a floured rolling pin, roll out each log into a 12- to 14-inch strip on a lightly floured surface. Transfer strips to 2 greased baking sheets. Brush strips with glaze and sprinkle with one fourth of remaining sesame seeds.
Bake crackers: Bake in upper and lower thirds of oven, switching position of sheets halfway through baking, 20 minutes total, or until glaze is golden brown and crackers are crisp. Transfer to racks to cool. Make more crackers in same manner.

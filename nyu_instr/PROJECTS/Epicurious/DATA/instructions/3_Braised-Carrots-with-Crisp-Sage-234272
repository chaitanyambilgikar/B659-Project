Heat oil in a 12-inch straight-sided heavy skillet over moderate heat until hot but not smoking, then fry sage leaves, stirring, until just crisp, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain.
Add carrots to oil in skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until beginning to brown, about 8 minutes. Stir in remaining ingredients and simmer, covered, until carrots are just tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove lid and boil, stirring occasionally, until liquid is reduced to a glaze, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Serve carrots sprinkled with sage leaves.

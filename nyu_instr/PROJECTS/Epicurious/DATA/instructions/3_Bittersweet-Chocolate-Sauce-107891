Whisk sugar and cocoa powder in heavy small saucepan to blend. Whisk in 1/2 cup water. Add chopped chocolate. Stir over medium heat until chocolate melts and mixture is smooth and begins to simmer, about 5 minutes. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Rewarm chocolate sauce before serving.)

Pick over the black-eyed peas to remove dirt and stones. Soak them in water to cover at least 4 hours or overnight. Fry the salt pork in a large heavy casserole to render the fat. When the salt pork is crisp, add the black-eyed peas and the quart of water, the thyme, salt, and pepper, cover, and cook over low heat for 40 minutes. Adjust the seasonings and continue to cook until the peas are tender. Add the rice, cover with the 3 cups hot water, and simmer over low heat until all of the liquid has been absorbed and the rice is tender. Serve hot.

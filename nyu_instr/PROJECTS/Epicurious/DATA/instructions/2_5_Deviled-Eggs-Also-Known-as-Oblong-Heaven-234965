Shell the eggs, cut them in half lengthwise, and remove the yolks carefully. (We don't want messy broken whites, do we?) Put the yolks in a bowl and mash with a fork. Add all the remaining ingredients (except the chives) to the yolks and mix well. Place a dollop of the yolk mixture in the indentation in each of the egg white halves and garnish with chopped chives.
Here's a hint: Cut your chives up with scissors instead of a knife. The process will go much more quickly.
Shelling eggs Getting those hard-boiled eggs out of the shell can be quite a chore. I've found that the best way begins with the cooking. Boil your eggs for exactly ten minutes, then transfer them to a bowl of cold water immediately and leave them there for at least another ten minutes. This will stop the cooking of the eggs and ensure the easy removal of the shells. Once your eggs have cooled, take one and crack the shell, starting at the large end, where the little pocket of air usually is, and continue all the way around. Then, under running water, find or make a small tear in the membrane beneath the shell and let the water run between the membrane and the egg. The water will do most of the work for you and the egg will practically peel itself!

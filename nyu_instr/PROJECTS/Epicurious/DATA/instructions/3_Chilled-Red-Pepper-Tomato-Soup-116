Preheat broiler. Holding bell pepper at stem, cut into 3 flat pieces. Discard stem end, core and seeds. Repeat with remaining pepper. Place pieces skin side up on broilerproof pan. Broil bell peppers until skin is charred and blackened, about 8 minutes. Transfer bell peppers to plastic bag. Twist bag to seal and let stand until peppers are cool. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead; chill.)
Peel peppers and cut into thirds. Combine with tomato juice and garlic in blender. Puree until smooth. Stir in green onions and basil. Season generously with pepper. Refrigerate overnight.
Garnish with yogurt and serve.

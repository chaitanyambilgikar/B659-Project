Preheat oven to 350°F. Spray heavy large baking sheet with nonstick vegetable oil spray. Combine ground beef, grated Parmesan cheese, eggs, chopped fresh parsley, crushed cornflakes, minced garlic, dried oregano, ground white pepper and salt in large bowl and blend thoroughly. Using moistened hands, shape meat mixture into 1 1/2-inch rounds and place on prepared sheet, spacing evenly. Bake meatballs until just firm to touch and cooked through, about 20 minutes
Bring marinara sauce to simmer in heavy large saucepan. Add meatballs to sauce and simmer until sauce thickens slightly, about 15 minutes. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Rewarm over low heat before continuing.)
Gently press center of bottoms of rolls to compact slightly. Spoon 5 or 6 meatballs into depression in each roll. Spoon enough sauce over to coat. Place tops of rolls over and serve.

Preheat broiler. Broil bread until one side is toasted, about 1 minute. Spread second side with butter; sprinkle with freshly ground pepper. Broil bread until golden brown, about 2 minutes.
Spread crème fraîche over bread slices. Sprinkle chives in diagonal line across center of each. Spoon golden caviar on one side of chives, black on other side and then serve.

Bring water, wine, and oil to a boil in a 5- to 6-quart wide pot over moderately high heat. Add clams and boil, covered, 3 minutes. Sprinkle garlic, cilantro, and pepper over clams and boil, covered, until clams just open wide, 4 to 6 minutes. (Discard any clams that remain unopened after 9 minutes.)
Gently stir clams, then spoon into large shallow soup bowls along with broth.

PREHEAT the oven 350° F. Lightly grease a 9" by 4" loaf pan with nonstick cooking spray.
IN the bowl of a standing mixer with a paddle attachment or with an electric mixer, puree the bananas on medium speed. Add the oil and blend on low speed for 30 seconds. Add the eggs and vanilla extract and blend on medium for 1 minute.
STIR together the remaining ingredients in a large bowl. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, working the batter with a large whisk to combine and make a slightly elastic batter, 3 minutes.
POUR the batter into the prepared pan and bake until the cake pulls away from the sides of the pan and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, about 55 minutes.
LET the bread cool in the pan for 15 minutes, and then turn out onto a wire rack to finish cooling before slicing. Serve warm or at room temperature.

Soak the escarole in a bowl of cool water for 10 minutes to crisp it. Drain and spin dry.
Combine the sunchokes, almonds, and cheese in a large bowl, tossing to mix. Add the escarole, tossing gently. Drizzle with half the vinaigrette, tossing to coat. Season with salt and pepper.
Transfer the salad to a serving bowl and serve with the remaining vinaigrette on the side.

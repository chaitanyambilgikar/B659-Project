For Sauce: Boil fish stock, dry white wine, mustard seeds and saffron threads in heavy small saucepan until reduced to 1/2 cup, about 20 minutes. Whisk cream and mustard. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
For Pancakes: Whisk eggs and flour in large bowl to blend. Stir in chopped fennel bulb, milk, chives, shallot, 2 teaspoons chopped tarragon and fennel seeds. Season generously with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Let stand 1 hour at room temperature before using.)
Preheat oven to 250°F. Pour thin film of oil into heavy large skillet and heat over medium heat. Working in batches, drop batter by scant 1/4 cups into skillet and cook until golden, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to cookie sheet. Keep warm in oven.
Add scallops to same skillet. Season with salt and pepper and sauté until cooked through, about 1 minute. Remove from heat. Bring sauce to simmer in heavy small saucepan; whisk in butter and 1 tablespoon chopped tarragon. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Spoon some sauce onto each plate. Top with pancake, then scallops. Drizzle more sauce over. Garnish with tarragon sprigs if desired and serve.

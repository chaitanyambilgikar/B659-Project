Whisk together marinade ingredients in a bowl. Place tilapia in marinade; turn to coat completely. Cover with plastic; refrigerate at least 1 hour. Combine mango, kiwi, cucumber, hearts of palm and lime juice in a bowl. Season with salt. Mix gently. Heat a charcoal, gas or electric grill over high heat. Brush grill with canola oil. Remove tilapia from marinade; blot excess with a paper towel. Grill fish, turning once, until cooked through, about 5 to 7 minutes. Garnish each fillet with 2/3 cup hearts of palm salad.

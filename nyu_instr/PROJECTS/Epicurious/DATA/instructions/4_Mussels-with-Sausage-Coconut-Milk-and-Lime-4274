Heat oil in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onion, sausage, lemongrass, ginger and garlic and sauté 5 minutes. Add all remaining ingredients except cilantro and mussels and bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer 5 minutes. Mix in half of cilantro.
Meanwhile, place mussels in large pot. Cover and cook over medium heat until mussels open and release their juices, about 5 minutes (discard any mussels that do not open).
Divide mussels among shallow soup bowls. Stir any mussel liquid into coconut-milk mixture; ladle over mussels. Sprinkle with remaining cilantro.

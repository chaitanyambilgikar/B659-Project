Heat a dry 12-inch heavy skillet or wok (not nonstick) over medium heat until hot. Add oil, then garlic, and cook, tossing constantly, until garlic is deep golden. Add watercress and salt, then reduce heat to medium-low and cook, tossing constantly, 45 seconds. Add stock and toss again, then cook, covered, until stems are crisp-tender and leaves are just wilted, about 20 seconds.
Serve with garlic cloves arranged on top.

Cream the butter and sugar and when smooth, add beaten egg. Sift the dry ingredients and mix 1 tablespoon with the chopped candied ginger. Add the rest to the butter mixture a bit at a time, alternating with the milk. When the dough is well mixed, add candied ginger. Pour into buttered 1 1/2-quart mold and cover tightly. Steam for 2 hours. Serve with whipped cream.

In a bowl, combine vinegar, 1 teaspoon oil and 1/4 teaspoon sugar. Add cabbage, carrots and broccoli slaw; toss and set aside. In a second bowl, combine cilantro, mint, fish sauce, soy sauce and remaining 1/2 tablespoon sugar. Add tuna and scallions; mix until combined. Form tuna mixture into four 3/4-inch-thick patties. Place panko on a plate; coat each patty with crumbs. In a large nonstick skillet, heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil over medium heat. Cook burgers, flipping once, until well browned, about 4 minutes per side. Place 1 burger on bottom of each bun; top with 1/4 of slaw and other bun half.

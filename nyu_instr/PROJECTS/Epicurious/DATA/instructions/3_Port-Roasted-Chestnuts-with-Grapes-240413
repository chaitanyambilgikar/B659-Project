Combine chicken broth, ruby Port, diced butter, orange peel strips, and sugar in large wide skillet. Bring to boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. Boil mixture until reduced and thickened enough to coat spoon, about 8 minutes. Add whole roasted chestnuts and seedless red grapes to skillet; sprinkle with coarse kosher salt. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until Port sauce is reduced to glaze and sauce coats chestnuts and grapes thickly, about 4 minutes. Season to taste with coarse kosher salt and pepper. Transfer chestnuts and grapes to bowl, sprinkle with chopped parsley, and serve.

Preheat oven to 350°F. and butter an 8-inch-square baking pan.
In a bowl with an electric mixer beat butter with sugar until light and fluffy. In another bowl whisk together flour, espresso powder, cocoa powder, salt, and cinnamon. Beat flour mixture into butter mixture until just combined.
On a lightly floured surface knead dough about 5 times, or until it just comes together. Press dough evenly into prepared and bake in middle of oven 35 to 45 minutes, or until browned lightly and just firm.
Cool shortbread in pan on a rack 10 minutes. While shortbread is still warm, loosen edges from pan with a small knife and carefully invert onto your hand covered with a kitchen towel. Invert shortbread onto a cutting board and cut into 9 squares. Cool shortbread completely on a rack set over a sheet of wax paper.
In a metal bowl set over a pan of barely simmering water melt chocolate, stirring, and cool slightly. Drizzle chocolate decoratively over shortbread and let stand until chocolate is hardened.

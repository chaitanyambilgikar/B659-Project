Line baking sheet with waxed paper. Place 1/2 cup breadcrumbs in shallow dish. Mix crabmeat, mayonnaise, 3 tablespoons chives, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, hot pepper sauce and remaining 1/4 cup breadcrumbs in medium bowl to blend. Season with salt and pepper. Mix in egg. Using 2 tablespoons for each, form crab mixture into twenty 1 1/2-inch-diameter cakes. Coat crab cakes with breadcrumbs in dish, pressing breadcrumbs to adhere. Transfer crab cakes to prepared baking sheet. Cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour and up to 6 hours.
Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Working in batches, add crab cakes to skillet and cook until golden brown and heated through, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer crab cakes to paper towel-lined plate.
Place mixed greens in large bowl. Toss with enough Lemon Vinaigrette to coat. Divide greens among 10 plates. Place 2 crab cakes alongside greens on each plate. Drizzle 1 teaspoon vinaigrette over each crab cake. Sprinkle with additional chives and serve.

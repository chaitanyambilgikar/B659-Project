Bring 16 cups cold water to a boil with chicken pieces (including neck and giblets) in an 8-quart pot, skimming froth. Add remaining 1/2 cup cold water and bring to a simmer, continuing to skim froth. Add remaining ingredients and simmer stock, uncovered, skimming froth occasionally, 3 hours.
Pour stock through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl, discarding solids. If using stock right away, skim off and discard any fat. If not, cool completely, uncovered, before skimming fat (it will be easier to remove when cool), then chill, covered.

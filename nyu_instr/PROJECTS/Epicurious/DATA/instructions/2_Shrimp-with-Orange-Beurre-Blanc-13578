In a small saucepan combine the reserved shrimp shells, the vermouth, the orange juice, and the zest and simmer the mixture, covered, for 5 minutes. Strain the mixture through a fine sieve into another small saucepan, discarding the shells. In a non-stick skillet melt 1 piece of the butter, over moderately high heat, in it sauté the shrimp, stirring, for 2 minutes, or until they are cooked through, and keep them warm, covered.
Bring the orange mixture to a boil, reduce the heat to moderately low, and whisk in the remaining 5 pieces butter, 1 piece at a time, lifting the skillet from the heat occasionally to cool the mixture and adding each new piece of butter before the previous one has melted completely. (The sauce should not get hot enough to liquefy. It should be the consistency of hollandaise.) Stir in the chives, the lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste, divide the shrimp between 2 plates, and spoon some of the sauce over each serving.

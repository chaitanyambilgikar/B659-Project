Cut the fresh tomatoes into pieces, then place fresh or canned tomatoes in a medium-sized saucepan with the olive oil, garlic, salt and pepper to taste and the basil leaves; simmer for 15 minutes.
Pass contents of pan through a food mill, using the disc with the smallest holes, into a crockery or glass bowl. Return the strained sauce to the saucepan and reduce for 5 minutes. Taste for salt and pepper.
Set the carta da musica bread, 1 sheet at a time, on a large serving platter, pour 1 cup of the broth over it and let soak for 5 minutes. Carefully transfer each bread sheet onto an individual dish.
Pour 1/4 of the still very warm tomato sauce over each sheet and spread it out with a ladle. Fold the overhanging pieces of the bread inward to reproduce the shape of the dish itself. Follow this procedure with all 4 sheets of bread.
Place a medium-sized saucepan with 3 cups of cold water over medium heat. When the water reaches a boil, add salt to taste and the wine vinegar. Break 1 egg in the water and carefully, using a small spoon, fold the white over the egg yolk; simmer for 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the uovo in camicia (poached egg) onto the bread and tomato sauce of one of the dishes. Repeat the same procedure with the other 3 eggs. Sprinkle abundant grated cheese over the 4 portions and serve.

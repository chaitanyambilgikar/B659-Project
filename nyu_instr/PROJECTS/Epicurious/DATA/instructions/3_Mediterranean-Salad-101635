Cook potatoes in medium pot of boiling salted water 4 minutes. Add carrots and cook until all vegetables are crisp-tender, about 4 minutes longer. Drain. Rinse vegetables under cold water. Drain well. Combine potatoes, carrots, fennel bulb, garbanzo beans, red onion, roasted peppers and parsley in large bowl.
Whisk vinegar, oil and garlic in small bowl. Add to salad; toss to coat.
Cut eggs in half lengthwise. Separate yolks from whites (reserve 2 yolks for another use). Chop egg whites; mix into salad. Season with salt and pepper. Mound salad in serving bowl. Crumble remaining 2 yolks over salad. Garnish with fennel fronds. Serve at room temperature or cover and chill up to 4 hours.

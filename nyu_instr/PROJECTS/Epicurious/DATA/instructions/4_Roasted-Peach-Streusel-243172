Preheat oven to 425°F with rack in middle.
Drizzle 2 tablespoons butter over bottom of a 9-inch baking dish or pie plate and arrange peach halves cut sides up.
Pulse almonds, flour, 1/3 cup sugar, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and remaining 3 tablespoons butter in a food processor until clumps form.
Top peaches with streusel and bake until peaches are tender and streusel is browned, about 20 minutes (if browning too quickly, loosely cover with foil).
Meanwhile, whip cream with almond extract and remaining tablespoon sugar until it just holds soft peaks.
Serve peaches warm with cream.

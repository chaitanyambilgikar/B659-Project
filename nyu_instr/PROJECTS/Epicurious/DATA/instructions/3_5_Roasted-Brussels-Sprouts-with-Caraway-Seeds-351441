Preheat oven to 450°F with rack in middle.
Toss Brussels sprouts with oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a bowl until well coated. Transfer to a large 4-sided sheet pan in 1 layer and roast 10 minutes. Sprinkle caraway seeds over Brussels sprouts and toss, then spread out in 1 layer and roast until Brussels sprouts are crisp-tender and well browned in spots, about 10 minutes more.

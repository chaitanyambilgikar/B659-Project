1. Combine 3 tablespoons olive oil, garlic, parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Add lamb chops and toss to coat. Cover tightly with saran wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
2. While lamb marinates, make the smash. Boil carrots in hot, salted water for 20–25 minutes or until very soft. Drain and return to pot. Mash in remaining olive oil and gorgonzola. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Smash using the back of a fork until very creamy with few chunks.
3. When lamb has finished marinating, remove from refrigerator, uncover, and bring to room temperature, about 10 minutes.
4. Heat a grill pan or regular grill to high heat. Grill lamb chops for 4–5 minutes on each side, depending on desired doneness. To serve, spoon a bit of the carrot smash onto a plate and top each pile of smash with a lamb chop. Garnish with more parsley if desired.

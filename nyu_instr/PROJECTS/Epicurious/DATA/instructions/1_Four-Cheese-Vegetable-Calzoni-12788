Make the dough: In a large bowl proof the yeast with the sugar in 1 cup warm water for 5 minutes, or until it is foamy. In a food processor blend the flour and the salt, with the motor running add the yeast mixture and the oil, and blend the mixture until it forms a ball. Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface 8 to 10 times and transfer it to a lightly oiled bowl. Turn the dough to coat it with the oil and let it rise, covered with plastic wrap, in a warm place for 1 hour, or until it is double in bulk.
Make the filling In a large heavy skillet cook the garlic, the onion, and the red pepper flakes in the oil over moderately low heat, stirring, until the onion is softened. Add the fennel, the bell peppers, and salt and pepper to taste and cook the mixture, covered, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender. Add the tomatoes and cook the mixture, covered, for 5 minutes. Remove the lid, cook the mixture, stirring, until most of the liquid is evaporated, and stir in the parsley. In a bowl stir together the cheeses.
Punch down the dough, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and divide it into 6 equal pieces. Roll 1 piece of the dough into a 7- to 8-inch round, spoon about 1/2 cup of the vegetable mixture onto one half of round, and top it with about 2/3 cup of the cheeses. Fold the other half of the dough over the filling, stretching the dough to enclose the filling, pinch the edges of the dough together, and fold the bottom edge the dough up over the top edge. Crimp the edge to seal the calzone, transfer the calzone with a lightly floured spatula to a lightly oiled baking sheet, and make 5 more calzoni in the same manner. Bake the calzoni on the bottom rack of a preheated 450°F. oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until they are golden, transfer them to a rack, and let them stand for 5 minutes.

For Mousse: Place 2 tablespoons water in small bowl. Sprinkle gelatin over; let stand 10 minutes to soften. Whisk yolks, syrup and 4 tablespoons water in medium metal bowl. Set bowl over saucepan of simmering water (do not allow bottom of bowl to touch water). Whisk constantly until candy thermometer registers 160°F, about 7 minutes. Remove from over water. Add gelatin mixture to yolk mixture; whisk to dissolve. Using electric mixture, beat mixture until cool and slightly thickened, about 8 minutes. Whip cream and maple flavoring in large bowl to medium-stiff peaks. Fold yolks mixture into whipped cream. Divide among 6 glasses. Cover; chill until mousse sets, about 4 hours. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Keep chilled.)
For Compote: Puree raspberries in syrup in processor. Strain into heavy large saucepan. Boil 1 minute. Remove from heat. Add remaining berries; stir gently just until coated with sauce. Cool completely (berries will thaw as they sit). Spoon over mousse. Garnish with mint.

For crust: Mix flour, sugar and salt in medium bowl. Add butter and rub in until mixture resembles coarse meal. Whisk yolk and water in small bowl. Add to flour mixture and mix just until dough clumps together. Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk. Cover with plastic wrap and chill 1 hour.
Soften dough slightly at room temperature. Press dough evenly over bottom and up sides 9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom. Trim excess dough and reserve. Freeze crust until firm, about 25 minutes.
Preheat oven to 400°F. Line crust with foil; fill with dried beans or pie weights. Bake until sides are set, about 15 minutes. Remove foil and beans. Bake crust until light golden, piercing bottom with fork if crust bubbles and patching with reserved dough if crust cracks, about 10 minutes longer. Cool crust completely on rack.
For filling: Whisk egg yolks, 2 tablespoons sugar and cornstarch in medium bowl to blend. Bring whipping cream and apple juice concentrate to simmer in heavy medium saucepan. Whisk into yolk mixture. Return mixture to same saucepan and whisk over medium heat until mixture boils and thickens, about 2 minutes. Transfer to bowl and cool. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Store crust at room temperature; refrigerate filling.)
Preheat oven to 375°F. Melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add apples and sauté until tender and light golden, about 10 minutes. Add 3 tablespoons sugar; toss until sugar dissolves and apples are glazed, about 3 minutes. Cool until just warm to touch, about 15 minutes.
Spread cream filling over bottom of crust. Arrange apples in concentric circles atop filling. Bake tart 15 minutes. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon sugar; bake until filling is set and apples are glazed, about 10 minutes longer. Serve tart slightly warm or at room temperature.

1. Place the oil in a large, heavy pot over medium heat. Add the onions, carrots, and bell pepper and cook about 8 minutes. Add the zucchini and squash; continue to cook until all the vegetables are tender, about 8 minutes more.
2. Add remaining ingredients, except the garnishes; combine well. Bring to a boil, reduce heat; simmer gently for 1 hour, stirring occasionally. Serve in bowls with a dollop of sour cream and grated Cheddar, if desired.

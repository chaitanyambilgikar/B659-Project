In a kettle of boiling salted water cook the carrots for 3 minutes, add the turnips, and boil the vegetables for 3 to 5 minutes, or until they are tender. Drain the vegetables and transfer them to a serving dish. Add the butter, cut into bits, the nutmeg, and salt and pepper to taste and toss the mixture until the butter is melted.

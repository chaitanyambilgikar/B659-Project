Quarter each chicken, discarding the first 2 joints of the wings. Remove the breastbones and ribs and remove the skin and any fat. Have ready in 3 wide shallow bowls the flour, the eggs, and the bread crumbs. Dredge the chicken in the flour, shaking off the excess, dip it in the egg, letting the excess drip off, and coat it well with the bread crumbs, shaking off the excess. Arrange the chicken on a baking sheet lined with wax paper and chill it, uncovered, for 30 minutes. The chicken may be prepared up to this point 1 day in advance and kept uncovered and chilled.
In a large deep skillet heat 1 inch of the oil to 360°F. and in it fry the chicken in batches without crowding, turning it, for 5 minutes, or until it is golden brown, transferring it as it is fried to paper towels to drain. Arrange the chicken on a rack in a shallow pan and bake it in the middle of a preheated 350°F. oven for 15 minutes for the breast pieces and 20 minutes for the leg pieces. Arrange the chicken on heated platters, garnish it with the thyme, and serve it with the chutney.

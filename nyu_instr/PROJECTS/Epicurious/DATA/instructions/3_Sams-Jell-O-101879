Bring water to a boil and add gelatin. When gelatin is dissolved add strawberry purée and blend. Allow to cool to room temperature. Place berries in glasses and pour gelatin purée mixture on top (use martini glasses if available). You can use more berries if you like.
Chill for 4 hours.
Whip heavy cream and sugar until soft peaks form. Using pastry bag, pipe whipped cream on top of chilled berry mixture. Garnish with fresh berries.

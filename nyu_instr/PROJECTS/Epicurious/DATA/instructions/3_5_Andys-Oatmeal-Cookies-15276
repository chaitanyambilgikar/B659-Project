Preheat oven to 375°F.
Into a small bowl sift together flour, cinnamon, baking soda, salt, and nutmeg. In a large bowl with an electric mixer beat together butter and sugars until light and fluffy. Beat in egg and vanilla and stir in flour mixture, oats, and coconut until combined well.
Arrange rounded tablespoons of dough about 3 inches apart on ungreased baking sheets and with moistened fingers flatten mounds into 3-inch rounds. Bake cookies in batches in middle of oven until golden, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool cookies on sheets 1 minute and transfer with a metal spatula to racks to cool completely. Cookies keep in an airtight container at room temperature 5 days.

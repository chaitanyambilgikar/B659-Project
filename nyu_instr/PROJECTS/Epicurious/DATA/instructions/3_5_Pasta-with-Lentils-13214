In a large heavy skillet cook the onion with the thyme in the oil in moderate heat, stirring, until the onion is golden. While the onion is cooking, combine the lentils with 1 1/3 cups water, bring the water to a boil, and simmer the lentils, covered, for 12 minutes. Add the carrot and simmer the mixture, covered for 3 minutes, or until the lentils and carrot are just tender. Transfer the lentil mixture with the liquid to the skillet, season it with salt and pepper, and keep it at a bare simmer while cooking the pasta.
In a large saucepan of salted boiling water boil the pasta until it is al dente. Ladle out and reserve about 1/2 cup of the pasta liquid, drain the pasta, and add it to the lentil mixture. Simmer the pasta mixture, tossing it to combine it and adding some of the reserved pasta liquid to moisten the mixture if necessary, for 1 minute. Stir in the parsley and transfer the mixture to a heated serving bowl. Serve the pasta with the Parmesan.

Preheat oven to 350°F. Generously coat 12-cup Bundt pan with nonstick spray. Whisk flour, sugar, orange peel, and lemon peel in large bowl to blend. Using electric mixer, beat eggs in another large bowl until thick, about 4 minutes. Gradually beat in oil, buttermilk, and vanilla. Add flour mixture and beat until just blended.
Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake cake until tester inserted near center comes out clean, about 45 minutes.
Cool cake in pan on rack 20 minutes. Invert onto platter; cool completely. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and let stand at room temperature.)

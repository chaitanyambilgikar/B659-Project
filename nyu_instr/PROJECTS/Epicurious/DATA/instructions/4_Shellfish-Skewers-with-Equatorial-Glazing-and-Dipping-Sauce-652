Heat oil in small saucepan over very low heat until warm. Stir in chilies, ginger and garlic. Cover and cook 6 minutes, stirring occasionally (do not brown). Mix wine, soy sauce, sugar and cornstarch dissolves. Add to chili mixture; increase heat to medium-high and whisk until mixture comes to boil and thickens slightly. Remove sauce from heat. Transfer to bowl and cool to room temperature. Stir in lime juice. (Can be made 4 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.)
Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Pour 1/2 cup sauce into small bowl. Add cilantro to remaining sauce; reserve. Alternate 4 shrimp and 4 scallops on each skewer. Brush both sides with 1/2 cup sauce. Grill just until cooked through, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to plates. Serve with reserved sauce.

Preheat oven to 400°F. Place pears in large bowl; toss with lemon juice and vanilla. Melt butter in large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Add sugar; shake skillet to spread sugar evenly. Place pears, cut side down, in skillet; drizzle with any remaining lemon juice mixture from bowl. Cook until sugar begins to dissolve and mixture bubbles all over, shaking pan often, about 5 minutes. Transfer skillet to oven. Bake pears until soft and juices are golden, about 15 minutes. Divide pears among plates. Top each pear half with scoop of ice cream. Drizzle with sauce from skillet and serve.

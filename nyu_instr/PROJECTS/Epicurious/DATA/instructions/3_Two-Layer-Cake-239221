For the cake layers 1. Preheat oven to 375°F. In a large bowl, stir together the butter and sugar until well combined.
2. Add the egg and vanilla and mix thoroughly. Set aside.
3. In a separate bowl, stir together the baking powder, salt, and flour.
4. Sift the dry ingredients into the butter mixture and stir.
5. Gradually add the milk and stir until the batter is smooth.
6. Grease and flour two 9-inch baking pans, pour the batter in, and bake until a toothpick stuck into the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Remove
For vanilla buttercream icing Beat the butter on high until light and fluffy. Add the vanilla and milk and beat while gradually adding the sugar. Cover and refrigerate. Bring to room temperature before frosting the cake.
For colored flower frosting Beat the butter on high until light and fluffy. Add the vanilla and milk and beat while gradually adding the sugar. Beat again. Divide the mixture among four bowls and stir a couple of drops of food coloring into each. Cut the tips off disposable plastic pastry bags and insert metal flower tips. Fill each bag of the way with colored frosting, then cinch the open ends with rubber bands. To decorate as pictured above, squeeze rosettes onto a 9-inch parchment round and let the frosting set for a few minutes. Using a thin metal spatula, transfer the flowers from the parchment to the frosted cake.

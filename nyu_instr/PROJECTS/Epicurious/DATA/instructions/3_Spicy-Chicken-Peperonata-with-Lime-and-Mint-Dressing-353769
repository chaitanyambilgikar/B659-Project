Whisk 4 tablespoons oil, lime juice, mint, and coriander in medium bowl. Season dressing with salt and pepper.
Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper. Add to skillet and sauté until brown on bottom, about 5 minutes. Turn chicken over. Reduce heat to medium-low; cover and cook until just cooked through, about 5 minutes. Transfer to platter.
Return skillet to medium-high heat. Add bell peppers, poblano chile, and onion to same skillet; sprinkle vegetables with salt and pepper. Toss until tender and just beginning to color, 4 to 5 minutes. Cover and cook 1 minute. Mix in 2 tablespoons dressing. Mound vegetables atop chicken. Drizzle with remaining dressing and serve.

Grind first 6 ingredients in mortar with pestle or in spice mill until finely ground. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 week ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.
Score duck skin only (not flesh) in 1/2-inch diamond pattern. Sprinkle spice blend all over duck; gently massage into meat. Cover and chill overnight. Let stand at room temperature 1 hour before cooking. Position 1 rack in top third and 1 rack in bottom third of oven; preheat to 425°F. Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium heat. Add garlic and sauté until beginning to brown, about 3 minutes. Add kale; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Toss until kale wilts. Add broth and bring to boil. Reduce heat to low; cover and cook until kale is tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Uncover pot. Increase heat to high and cook kale until almost all liquid is absorbed, about 3 minutes. Set aside.
Heat heavy large ovenproof skillet over high heat. Add duck breasts, skin side down, to skillet. Cook until skin is browned and fat is rendered, about 8 minutes. Transfer duck, skin side up, to rimmed baking sheet and place in oven. Roast until cooked to desired doneness, 3 to 5 minutes for small duck breasts and 8 to 10 minutes for large duck breasts for medium-rare. Tent with foil to keep warm. Let rest 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, pour off all but 1 tablespoon fat from skillet. Add grapes to skillet and roast in oven until skins begin to split, about 15 minutes.
Gently rewarm kale. Thinly slice duck breasts. Arrange sliced duck on plates, dividing equally. Spoon kale alongside. Garnish with grapes and serve.

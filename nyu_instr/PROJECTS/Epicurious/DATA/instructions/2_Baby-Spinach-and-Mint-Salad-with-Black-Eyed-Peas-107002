Simmer peas, water, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a 1-quart saucepan, uncovered, over moderate heat until peas are just tender, about 15 minutes. Drain in a colander and rinse under cold water, then spread peas out on a paper towel and pat dry.
Grind fennel seeds with cayenne and black pepper to a powder in grinder, then transfer to a small bowl. Add peas to spice mixture and toss to coat.
Whisk together juices, broth, honey, oil, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt in a large bowl and add spinach and mint, tossing to coat. Serve salad sprinkled with spiced peas.

Cook potatoes in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender, about 8 minutes. Drain potatoes well. Transfer potatoes to large bowl and cool.
Heat vegetable oil in heavy medium skillet over high heat. Add chopped onion and stir until beginning to brown, about 4 minutes. Add chopped jalapeño chilies and stir until beginning to soften, about 1 minute. Add mustard seeds and cumin seeds and stir until aromatic, about 30 seconds. Immediately pour onion mixture over potatoes and stir to coat. Mix in low-fat yogurt, cucumber and tomatoes. Season raita to taste with salt and pepper. Cover tightly and refrigerate until well chilled, at least 2 hours. (Raita can be prepared up to 6 hours ahead. Keep refrigerate.) Garnish raita with fresh cilantro leaves and serve.

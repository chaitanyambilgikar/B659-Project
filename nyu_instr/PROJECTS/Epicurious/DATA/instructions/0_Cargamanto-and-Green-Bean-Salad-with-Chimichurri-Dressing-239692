Quick-soak dried beans: Cover cargamanto beans with water by 2 inches in a medium pot. Bring to a boil, then boil 1 minute. Remove from heat and cover, then soak 1 hour. Drain, discarding water.
Cook beans: Return drained cargamanto beans to pot and add 8 cups water and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil, then simmer beans, partially covered, until tender, 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours.
Make dressing while beans cook: Mince and mash garlic to a paste with 1/2 teaspoon salt, then whisk together with lemon juice and oil in a large bowl.
Drain cargamanto beans well and add to dressing while still hot, tossing to coat. Cool to room temperature, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes.
Cook green beans in a large pot of boiling salted water (2 tablespoons salt for 6 quarts water) until just tender, 4 to 6 minutes. Drain, then plunge into an ice bath to stop cooking. Drain beans and pat dry, then stir into cargamanto beans with celery and parsley. Season with salt and pepper and serve at room temperature.

Lightly coat an 8-by-8-inch baking pan with cooking spray.
MAKE THE FLUFF: In the bowl of a stand mixer, whisk together all ingredients until smooth. Put the bowl on the mixer and fit it with the whisk attachment. Beat the fluff on high speed until it triples in volume and forms firm peaks, about 7 to 8 minutes (it will resemble softly whipped cream). Stop the mixer.
PLACE THE SUGAR, Genutine, corn syrup, water, and salt in a food processor and process for 1 minute. Pour the syrup into a large saucepan and stir gently over high heat. Boil for 8 minutes, stirring often. The syrup will thicken, forming bubbles almost 1 inch in diameter; you should see flashes of the bottom of the pan as you stir. Stir in the vanilla.
RESTART THE MIXER on medium speed. Quickly scrape the syrup into the mixer bowl all at once and immediately increase the speed to high. Beat for 7 to 9 minutes on high speed; the candy will turn opaque white and fluffy, and nearly fill the bowl. Scrape it into the prepared pan. Place a large sheet of parchment paper spritzed with cooking spray on top and use both hands to smooth the marshmallow evenly into the corners. Let set at room temperature for another 4 to 6 hours.
Remove parchment and use a knife to loosen the marshmallow from the edges of the pan. Invert the slab onto a coating-dusted work surface and dust it with more coating. Cut into pieces and dip the sticky edges in more coating, patting off the excess.

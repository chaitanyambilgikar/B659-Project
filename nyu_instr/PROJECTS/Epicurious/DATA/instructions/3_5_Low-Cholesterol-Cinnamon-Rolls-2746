Cook potato in medium saucepan of boiling water until tender, about 30 minutes. Drain, reserving 3/4 cup cooking liquid. Mash potato and transfer 1 cup to large bowl, reserving remainder for another use. Mix 3/4 cup cooking liquid into potato. Cool to lukewarm.
Sprinkle yeast and sugar over 1/2 cup warm water in small bowl; stir to dissolve. Let yeast mixture stand until foamy, about 10 minutes. Add yeast to mashed potato mixture.
Add milk, honey, 3 tablespoons oil and salt to potato mixture. Stir in enough flour, 1 cup at a time, to form soft dough. Knead dough on lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, adding more flour if dough is sticky, about 5 minutes. Let dough rest on floured work surface 20 minutes. Gently punch dough down.
Grease large bowl. Add dough, turning to coat entire surface. Cover bowl. Let dough rise in warm area until doubled in volume, about 40 minutes.
Grease large cookie sheet. Gently punch dough down. Roll dough out on lightly floured surface to 20x15-inch rectangle. Brush dough with egg whites. Mix brown sugar, raisins and cinnamon in medium bowl. Spread sugar mixture over dough, leaving 1-inch border on all sides. Starting at 1 long side, roll dough up jelly roll fashion to form cylinder. Pinch seam to seal. Cut cylinder into 2-inch-wide pieces. Arrange rolls on prepared sheet, placing cut side up and spacing 2 inches apart. Brush rolls with vegetable oil. Let cinnamon rolls rise until doubled in volume, about 35 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350°F. Bake rolls until golden brown, about 30 minutes. Cool slightly in pan on rack. Serve warm or at room temperature.

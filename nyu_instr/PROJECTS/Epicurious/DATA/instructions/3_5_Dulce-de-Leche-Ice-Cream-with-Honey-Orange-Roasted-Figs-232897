Preheat oven to 375°F. Boil orange juice and honey in small saucepan until reduced to generous 1/3 cup, about 10 minutes. Place in 8x8x2-inch glass baking dish and pour orange mixture over: 1 pound large black Mission figs, quartered
Bake until figs are tender and liquid is slightly syrupy, about 20 minutes, adding more orange juice by tablespoonfuls if mixture becomes too thick. Spoon figs and syrup over dulce de leche ice cream and serve.

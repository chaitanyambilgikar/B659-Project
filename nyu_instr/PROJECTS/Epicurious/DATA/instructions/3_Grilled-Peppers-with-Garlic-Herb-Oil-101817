Blend oil, parsley, rosemary and garlic in blender to coarse puree. Season herb oil with salt and pepper. Prepare barbecue (medium heat). Place peppers in 13 x 9 x 2-inch glass baking dish. Add herb oil; toss to coat. Let stand at least 15 minutes or up to 1 hour. Grill peppers with some marinade until just tender and slightly charred, about 10 minutes. Transfer to platter. Sprinkle with vinegar, salt and pepper.

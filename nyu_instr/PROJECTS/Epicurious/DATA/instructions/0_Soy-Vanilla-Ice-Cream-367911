Heat the soy creamer, 1 1/2 cups of the soy milk, the vanilla bean, and vanilla seeds in a saucepan until the mixture comes to a boil. Remove the pan from the heat and allow the vanilla bean to steep in the milk mixture for 20 minutes. While the mixture is cooling, prepare a slurry by mixing together the remaining 1/2 cup soy milk with the arrowroot powder. Add the agave nectar to the milk mixture and return to a boil. Decrease the heat and whisk in the slurry. Continue whisking until the mixture just begins to thicken. Remove from the heat and whisk in the xanthan gum. Let cool to room temperature, then refrigerate for several hours or overnight until cold. Remove the vanilla bean and freeze in the ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's directions.

In a large heavy saucepan combine the soaked beans with enough cold water to cover them by 1 inch and simmer them, uncovered, for 15 minutes, or until they are tender but not falling apart. While the beans are cooking, in a heavy skillet cook the onion, the carrots, and the garlic in 2 tablespoons of the oil over moderately low heat, stirring, until the carrots are softened and stir in the bell pepper. Reserve 1/2 cup of the cooking liquid, drain the beans, and in a bowl combine them with the vegetable mixture, the reserved cooking liquid, the remaining 6 tablespoons oil, the parsley, the lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste. Let the salad stand, covered and chilled, for 3 hours to allow the flavors to develop. The salad may be made 1 day in advance and kept covered and chilled. Serve the salad at room temperature with the pita wedges.

Preheat oven to 250°F. Whisk eggs with 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in shallow dish. Place flour on plate. Place breadcrumbs on another plate. Dredge fish in flour; shake off excess. Dip fish into seasoned eggs, then coat completely with breadcrumbs. Transfer to baking sheet.
Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add 2 fillets and cook until coating is golden brown and fillets are opaque in center, about 3 minutes per side. Using 2 spatulas, transfer to rimmed baking sheet; keep warm in oven. Repeat with remaining fillets. Transfer fish to platter. Garnish with lemon wedges and serve.

In a saucepan combine the potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces, the shallots, and the garlic with enough cold water to cover the mixture by 1 inch and simmer the mixture for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender. Drain the potato mixture, return it to the pan, and steam it over moderate heat, shaking the pan, for 30 seconds, or until any excess liquid is evaporated. Force the potato mixture through a ricer or the medium disk of a food mill into a bowl and stir in 1/2 cup of the bread crumbs, the goat cheese, the chives or scallions, and salt and pepper to taste. Form 1/2-cup measures of the mixture into four 3/4-inch-thick cakes, transferring the potato cakes as they are formed to a plate covered with the remaining 1/2 cup bread crumbs, and coat the potato cakes with the crumbs.
In a large heavy skillet heat the butter over moderately high heat until the foam subsides and in it sauté the potato cakes, turning them once, for 5 minutes on each side, or until they are crusty and golden brown.

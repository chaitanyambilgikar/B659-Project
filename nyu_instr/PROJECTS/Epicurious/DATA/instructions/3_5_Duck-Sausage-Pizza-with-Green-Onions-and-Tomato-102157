Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 450°F. Mix olive oil, minced garlic and dried crushed red pepper in small bowl. Place pizza crust on rimless baking sheet. Sprinkle grated mozzarella cheese over all but 1-inch border of crust. Top mozzarella with chopped tomato, then oregano, sliced sausages, chopped green onions and grated Parmesan, in that order. Drizzle garlic-oil mixture over pizza.
Bake pizza until crust edges are crisp and brown and cheese melts, about 15 minutes. Sprinkle pizza with minced fresh parsley. Cut pizza into wedges and then serve immediately.

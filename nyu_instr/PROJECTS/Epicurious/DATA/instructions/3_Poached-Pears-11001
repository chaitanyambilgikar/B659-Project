Core pears from blossom ends with melon-ball scoop and peel, leaving stems intact.
In a 2-quart saucepan simmer pears in juice with remaining ingredients, uncovered, turning occasionally, 10 to 15 minutes, or until pears are tender but still hold their shape. Transfer pears to a plate with a slotted spoon, reserving poaching liquid, and chill in freezer 15 minute.
While pears are chilling, boil reserved liquid until reduced to about 1 cup. Pour liquid into a bowl and put bowl in a larger bowl of ice and cold water. Stir liquid until cooled lightly.
Serve pears in shallow bowls with some poaching liquid and garnished with bay leaves. (Do not eat bay leaves.)

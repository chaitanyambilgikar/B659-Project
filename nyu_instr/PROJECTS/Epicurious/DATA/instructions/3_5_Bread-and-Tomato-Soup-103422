Divide basil and garlic between 2 large soup bowls. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onion and sauté 3 minutes. Add broth, tomatoes and bread and bring soup to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover and simmer until bread is falling apart, about 8 minutes. Transfer soup to processor. Using on/off turns, blend to coarse puree. Season soup with salt and pepper. Ladle into bowls over basil and garlic. Drizzle with remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Sprinkle with cheese.

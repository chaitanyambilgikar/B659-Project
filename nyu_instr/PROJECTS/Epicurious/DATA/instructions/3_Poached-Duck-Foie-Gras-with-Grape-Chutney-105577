Make poaching liquid: Combine demiglace, Port, red wine, vanilla bean, and 2 teaspoons pepper in a 4-quart heavy saucepan. Lightly crush grapes in a bowl with your hands and add to pan (including stems) with any juices. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, 30 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and discard grape stems (don't worry if some small stems remain attached). Cool to room temperature, about 2 hours.
Sprinkle foie gras with kosher salt and remaining 2 teaspoons pepper and cook in dry cleaned saucepan over moderately low heat until bottom is pale golden (do not brown), about 2 minutes, then gently turn over with a large slotted spatula and cook 2 minutes more (again, do not brown). Add cooled poaching liquid and simmer (do not boil) 6 minutes (foie gras will reach 125°F on an instant-read thermometer). Cool foie gras, uncovered, at room temperature in poaching liquid 30 minutes (foie gras will reach 140°F during cooling); for USDA standards, return to a simmer, checking temperature every minute, until foie gras reaches 160°F. Chill, loosely covered, at least 2 days and up to 3.
Carefully transfer foie gras to a plate with slotted spatula and chill, covered. Skim fat from poaching liquid, then pour liquid through a fine sieve into a large saucepan, discarding solids. Boil liquid, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 10 minutes (watch sauce carefully toward end of boiling; it scorches easily). Cool sauce to room temperature.
Serve foie gras whole on a cutting board or platter. Thinly slice, then sprinkle slices with sea salt and pepper. Place a slice of foie gras on a piece of bread, then top with chutney and drizzle with sauce.

Transfer mixture to a large bowl.
Add 1 tablespoon peanut oil to wok or skillet and heat until just smoking. Stir-fry half of squid until just opaque, about 30 seconds, and transfer with juices to bowl of vegetables. Add remaining tablespoon peanut oil and stir-fry remaining squid, transferring to bowl. Return squid-vegetable mixture to wok or skillet and stir-fry until heated. Season stir-fry with salt and pepper and stir in sesame oil.

Preheat oven to 375°F. Butter and flour eight 3/4-cup soufflé dishes. Stir 8 ounces chopped chocolate and butter in heavy medium saucepan over low heat until melted and smooth. Pour into large bowl. Whisk in yolks. Set chocolate mixture aside.
Stir sugar and water in heavy small saucepan over low heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat and boil without stirring until candy thermometer registers 236°F swirling pan occasionally, about 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, beat egg whites in another large bowl to soft peaks.
Gradually beat boiling syrup into whites in slow steady stream. Continue beating until stiff, about 3 minutes. Fold whites into chocolate mixture in 3 additions. Divide soufflé mixture among prepared dishes. Place 1 chocolate chunk in center of each, pressing to submerge. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate.)
Bake soufflés until slightly puffed and softly set, about 15 minutes. Serve immediately.

Preheat oven to 450°F.
Toss squash with 1 1/2 tablespoons oil in a shallow baking pan and spread cubes in 1 layer. Season with salt and pepper and roast in middle of oven, stirring once halfway through roasting, until squash is just tender and pale golden, about 30 minutes total. Cool in pan on a rack until warm, about 15 minutes.
While squash is roasting, cook almonds in remaining 4 tablespoons oil in a 10-inch skillet over moderately low heat, stirring constantly, until golden, about 3 minutes, then season with salt and pepper. Pour almonds and oil into a fine-mesh sieve set over a large bowl and cool until warm, about 10 minutes.
When almonds and oil have cooled, whisk lemon juice into oil in bowl until combined well, then season with salt and pepper. Add squash, spinach, and half of almonds to dressing and toss gently to coat.
Divide salad among 6 salad plates and sprinkle with remaining almonds.

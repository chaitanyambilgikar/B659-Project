In a large shallow dish stir together all ingredients except fish until combined well and add fish. Marinate fish, covered and chilled, turning occasionally, at least 1 hour and up to 2.
Prepare grill.
Grill fish on an oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals about 5 minutes on each side for medium-rare, or until desired doneness. (Alternatively, fish may be broiled.)

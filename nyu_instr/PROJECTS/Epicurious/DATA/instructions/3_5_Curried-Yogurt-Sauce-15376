In a blender or small food processor blend together 1/2 cup of the yogurt, the chutney, and the lime juice until the mixture is smooth, transfer the mixture to a bowl, and whisk in the remaining 1/4 cup yogurt, the mayonnaise, the curry powder, the 2 tablespoons onion, and salt and pepper to taste. Chill the sauce, covered, for at least 8 hours and up to 3 days. Transfer the sauce to a serving dish and sprinkle it with the additional onion.

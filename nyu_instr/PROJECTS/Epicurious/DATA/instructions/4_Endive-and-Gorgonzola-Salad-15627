Preheat oven to 350°F.
In a shallow baking pan toast walnuts in middle of oven until fragrant, about 10 minutes, and cool. Chop walnuts.
In a small bowl whisk together vinegars and 1/2 teaspoon honey and add oil in a stream, whisking until emulsified. Season dressing with salt and pepper.
Separate 4 outer leaves from each endive and arrange 3 leaves on each of 4 plates. Cut remaining endive crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices and put in a large bowl. Peel apple and using a mandoline or other manual slicer cut thin slices lengthwise from 4 sides, stopping just before core. Make small stacks of slices and cut stacks into thin julienne strips.
Toss sliced endive with dressing and divide among plates, mounding on whole leaves. Top salads with Gorgonzola, walnuts, apple, chives, and salt and pepper to taste. Drizzle remaining 2 teaspoons honey over salads.

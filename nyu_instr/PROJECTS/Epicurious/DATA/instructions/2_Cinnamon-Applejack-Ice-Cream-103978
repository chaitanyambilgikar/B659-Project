Scrape seeds from vanilla bean into a 2- to 3-quart heavy saucepan and add pod, half-and-half, cream, and cinnamon. Heat just to boiling over moderate heat.
Meanwhile, whisk together yolks and sugar. Whisk one third of hot cream mixture into yolks to temper egg, then whisk egg mixture into remaining cream mixture and cook over moderately low heat, stirring constantly, just until mixture registers 175°F on an instant-read thermometer.
Immediately transfer custard to a metal bowl set in a larger bowl of ice and cold water and cool, stirring occasionally. Chill, covered, at least 8 hours to blend flavors.
Pour custard through a sieve into a bowl and stir in brandy. Freeze in ice-cream maker, then transfer to an airtight container and put in freezer to harden.

Heat 1 inch oil in a 2 1/2- to 3-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat until thermometer registers 360°F.
While oil heats, peel parsnip, then shave as many ribbons as possible from parsnip with vegetable peeler.
Fry ribbons in 3 batches, stirring frequently, until edges are golden but middles are still pale, about 40 seconds to 1 minute per batch. Transfer parsnips as fried with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain, then season lightly with salt. (Return oil to 360°F between batches.) Parsnips will crisp as they cool.

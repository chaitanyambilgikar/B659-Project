Preheat oven to 300°.
Coarsely chop tomatoes with juice in a food processor. Put roast in an ovenproof 4- to 5-quart heavy pot or a casserole dish with a lid. Pour tomatoes over roast and scatter garlic around it. Season with salt and pepper. Braise in middle of oven, covered, until very tender, 3 to 4 hours.
Cut roast into 1/4-inch-thick slices and serve with sauce and garlic.

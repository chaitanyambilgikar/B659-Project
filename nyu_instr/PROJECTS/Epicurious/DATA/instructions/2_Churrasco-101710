When the steak is ready, cut it in rather thin diagonal slices and put these in the sauce for a minute. Serve each person some of the sauce with the meat.
Good accompaniments for this steak dish are home fried potatoes, sautéed or roasted onions, and French bread with butter. For a drink, beer is the best choice, since the vinegar in the sauce will kill a good wine.
Varitation Substitute any other steak cut; or slice rare rib roast of beef and serve it in the same manner.

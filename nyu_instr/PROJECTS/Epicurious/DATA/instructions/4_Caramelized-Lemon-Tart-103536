for crust: Combine flour, sugar and salt in processor. Add butter; cut in using on/off turns until mixture forms coarse crumbs. Mix yolk and ice water in small bowl. Add to crumb mixture; process until dough begins to clump together. Press over bottom and up sides of 9-inch tart pan with removable bottom. Trim edges. Pierce crust all over with fork. Chill 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350°F. Line crust with foil. Fill with dried beans or pie weights. Bake until crust is set, about 20 minutes. Remove foil and beans. Continue baking until pale golden, pressing with back of fork if crust bubbles, about 20 minutes longer. Transfer crust to rack. Maintain oven temperature.
for filling: Whisk eggs, 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar, cream and lemon juice in large bowl. Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; whisk to blend well. Pour filling into tart shell.
Bake tart until filling is set, about 40 minutes. Transfer tart to rack and cool. Refrigerate until cold, at least 3 hours or overnight.
Preheat broiler. Sift powdered sugar over tart. Broil until caramelized, watching closely, about 1 minute. Refrigerate tart 15 minutes. Remove tart pan sides. Transfer tart to platter.

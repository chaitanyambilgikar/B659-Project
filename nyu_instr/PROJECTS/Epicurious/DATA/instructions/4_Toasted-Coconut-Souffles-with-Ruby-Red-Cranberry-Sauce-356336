For sauce: Bring all ingredients to boil in small saucepan, stirring until sugar dissolves. Reduce heat; simmer until berries are soft, about 6 minutes. Pour mixture through strainer set over bowl, pressing on solids to extract liquid. Discard solids in strainer. DO AHEAD: Can be made 3 days ahead. Cover and chill. Rewarm sauce before using.
For soufflés: Melt butter in medium saucepan over medium heat. Add flour; whisk until bubbling but not brown, about 2 minutes. Gradually add coconut milk; whisk until mixture boils and thickens, about 1 minute. Remove from heat; whisk in 2 1/2 tablespoons sugar, rum, extract, and salt. Transfer to large bowl. Place plastic wrap directly onto surface of soufflé base. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover; chill. Bring to room temperature; whisk until smooth before continuing.
Butter eight 3/4-cup custard cups or ramekins; sprinkle with sugar, tilting cups to coat completely and tapping out any excess. Place cups on rimmed baking sheet. Using electric mixer, beat egg whites in large bowl until soft peaks form. Gradually add 21/2 tablespoons sugar and beat until medium-stiff peaks form. Add 1/4 of whites to coconut base and whisk until lightened. Add remaining whites in 2 additions and fold in with rubber spatula. Fold in crushed toasted coconut. Divide soufflé mixture among prepared cups; smooth tops. DO AHEAD: Can be made 6 hours ahead. Cover and chill.
Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 375°F. Bake soufflés until puffed and beginning to brown, about 18 minutes. Transfer 1 soufflé to each of 8 plates. Top with warm cranberry sauce and garnish with toasted coconut; serve immediately.

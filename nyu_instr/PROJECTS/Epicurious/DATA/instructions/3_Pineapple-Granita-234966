Place the sugar and 1/2 cup water in a saucepan and heat until the sugar dissolves into a clear liquid (simple sugar). Set aside to cool. Cut the pineapple into chunks, discarding the skin and core. Put some pineapple and some simple syrup in a blender or food processor and puree. Repeat until you've pureed all the pineapple and syrup. Pour into an 8- or 9-inch baking pan and freeze partway, stirring occasionally (so it doesn't become too solid to dish up). Scoop the partially frozen mixture into a tub or compote dishes to freeze up completely; it should be somewhat granular and scrape off the pan in long strips with the spoon. Serve garnished with the berries and the mint.

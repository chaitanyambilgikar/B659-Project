Halve the eggs lengthwise and transfer the yolks to a mixing bowl. Set the egg white halves on a platter, cover, and refrigerate.
With a fork, mash the yolks to a smooth consistency. Add the mayonnaise, sour cream, Frank's sauce, blue cheese, parsley, and celery salt, and mix until smooth. (You can also do this using an electric mixer with a whip attachment.) Taste and season accordingly.
Spoon the mixture into a pastry bag fitted with a plain or large star tip, then pipe the mixture evenly into the egg white halves. Or fill the eggs with a spoon, dividing the filling evenly.
To make the topping, in a small bowl, mix Frank's sauce with the celery until well coated. Top each egg half with about 1 teaspoon of the mixture and a celery leaf.

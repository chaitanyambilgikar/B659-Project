1 Lightly season the pork with salt and pepper. Place in a slow cooker insert, add the barbecue sauce, and cover. Cook on low until the pork is fork-tender, 8-9 hours.
2 Skim off any fat from the sauce surface. Transfer the pork to a carving board. Let stand for 5 minutes. Using two forks, shred the pork, discarding any excess fat. Return to the slow cooker.
3 Heap the meat and sauce onto the buns and serve hot.

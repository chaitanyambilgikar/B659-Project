Place cooked leftover vegetables in large strainer. Lower strainer into large pot of boiling water until butter and seasonings are removed, about 30 seconds. Rinse with cold water; pat dry. Transfer to large bowl and mix in tomatoes.
Whisk all remaining ingredients in bowl; toss with vegetable mixture. Cover and refrigerate at least 6 hours and up to 2 days. Bring vegetables to room temperature. Season with salt and pepper; serve.

Cut the cucumber into thin rectangular slices, about 3 inches long, and divide among 4 small plates.
Peel, devein, and butterfly the shrimp, leaving the tail intact but discarding the head. Arrange the shrimp on top of the cucumber slices, sprinkle with salt, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 1 1/2 hours.
In a blender, combine the lime juice, olive oil, chiles, and 1/4 cup of cold water. Process until smooth then season to taste with salt.
Just before serving, drizzle the shrimp with the lime-chile sauce and serve immediately.

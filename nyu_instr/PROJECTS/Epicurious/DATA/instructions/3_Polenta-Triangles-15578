Oil large baking sheet. Bring 2 cups water and salt to boil in heavy medium saucepan. Gradually whisk in cornmeal. Reduce heat to medium. Stir constantly with wooden spoon until mixture is very thick, about 6 minutes.
Divide hot polenta into 2 equal mounds on prepared baking sheet. Using back of spoon, flatten each mound into 6-inch circle, about 1/2 inch thick. Let stand until cool. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover with plastic and refrigerate.)
Cut each polenta circle into 6 wedges. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Working in batches, add polenta to skillet; cook until slightly crisp at edges and heated through, adding more oil to skillet as necessary, about 3 minutes per side. Serve warm.

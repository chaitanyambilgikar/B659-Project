Cut peel and white pith from blood oranges. Working over bowl to catch juices, cut between membranes to re-lease orange segments into bowl. Combine 1 cup water, 3/4 cup sugar and 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice in medium saucepan. Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add vanilla bean. Bring to boil. Reduce heat; simmer until liquid is syrupy, about 8 minutes. Stir in brandy and orange segments and any accumulated juices. Refrigerate until cold. Discard vanilla bean. Scoop vanilla ice cream into bowls. Spoon blood orange compote over and serve.

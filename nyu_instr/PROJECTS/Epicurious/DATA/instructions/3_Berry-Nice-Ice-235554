In a medium bowl, mix vodka and cassis. Add blueberries and let stand 1 hour. Strain through a fine mesh strainer into a small pitcher. Using an ice cream scoop, pack approximately 1 cup shaved ice into a paper snow cone cup (or cocktail glass), then drizzle with a quarter of the blueberry mixture. Repeat with remaining ice.

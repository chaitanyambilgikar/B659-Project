Whisk eggs, sugar and Frangelico in large metal bowl to blend. Set bowl over saucepan of simmering water (do not allow bottom of bowl to touch water); whisk constantly until mixture thickens and thermometer inserted into mixture registers 140°F. for 3 minutes, about 7 minutes total. Remove bowl from over water. Add white chocolate; whisk until smooth. Cool completely, whisking occasionally. Beat cream in medium bowl to medium-firm peaks. Fold whipped cream into white chocolate mixture in 3 additions (mixture will be soft). Chill until spreadable, about 3 hours.

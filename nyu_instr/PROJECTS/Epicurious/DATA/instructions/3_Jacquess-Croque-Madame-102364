Preheat the oven to 400°F.
Spread a thin layer of soft butter on one side only of both bread slices, then cover the buttered sides neatly with a layer of cheese. Arrange a layer of chicken on one bread slice and sprinkle on the chives and a few dashes of Tabasco, if you like. Flip the other piece of bread over on top (cheese inside, of course), press together, and spread more butter on the outsides of the sandwich, coating the slices evenly. Lay the assembled sandwich in the baking dish and prepare others the same way.
Bake the sandwiches for 10 minutes or so, until the bottom sides are crisp and golden. Flip them over and bake for about 5 minutes more, until the second sides are also well toasted.
Serve hot. For appetizer portions, trim off the crusts and cut each sandwich diagonally into 4 small triangles.

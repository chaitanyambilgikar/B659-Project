Preheat oven to 350°F. Combine garlic and oil in custard cup. Cover with foil; bake garlic until very tender, about 25 minutes. Pour oil into small bowl; reserve. Mash garlic; set aside. Increase oven temperature to 400°F.
Mix breadcrumbs, celery, olives, parsley, lemon peel and rosemary in small bowl. Season with salt and pepper.
Place turkey breast on work surface. Using meat mallet, pound turkey to about *-inch thickness. Spread mashed garlic over turkey, then sprinkle with salt and pepper. Spread breadcrumb mixture over turkey, leaving 1/2-inch border on all sides and pressing to adhere. Starting at 1 long side, roll up tightly, jelly-roll style. Tie roulade in 5 places with string to secure.
Place doubled 15-inch square of cheesecloth in 13x9x2-inch pan. Pour 1/2 cup broth over cloth. Place roulade on cloth. Drizzle reserved garlic oil over roulade. Wrap tightly with cheesecloth. Roast until cooked through and juices run clear when roulade is pierced in center, basting with 2/3 cup broth every 30 minutes, about 1 hour 15 minutes total.
Let roulade cool 15 minutes. Remove cheesecloth and string. Cut roulade into 1/2-inch slices; arrange on 6 plates. Add 1 cup broth to baking pan. Bring to simmer, scraping up browned bits. Pour broth over roulade.

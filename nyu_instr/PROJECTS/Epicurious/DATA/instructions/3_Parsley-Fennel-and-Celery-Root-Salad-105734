Tear enough fennel fronds into small sprigs to measure 1 1/2 cups. Trim fennel stalks flush with bulb and discard stalks. Quarter bulb lengthwise, then cut lengthwise into paper-thin slices with a mandoline or other manual slicer. Toss sliced fennel with fronds, parsley, and celery root in a large bowl.
Whisk together lemon juice (to taste), shallot, sugar, salt, pepper, and oil in a small bowl. Toss salad with dressing.

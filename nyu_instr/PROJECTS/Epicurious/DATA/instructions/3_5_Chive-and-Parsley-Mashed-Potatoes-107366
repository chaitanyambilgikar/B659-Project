Make oil: Purée chives and parsley with oil and salt in a blender until smooth. Pour herb oil through a fine-mesh sieve into a glass measure, pressing on and discarding solids.
Prepare potatoes: Peel and quarter potatoes. Cover potatoes with salted cold water by 1 inch in a 5-quart heavy pot, then simmer, uncovered, until very tender, about 25 minutes.
While potatoes are simmering, bring milk, butter, salt, and pepper just to a simmer, stirring until butter is melted.
Drain potatoes in a colander and return to pot. Add hot milk mixture and mash with a potato masher until almost smooth, then stir in 4 tablespoons herb oil.
If desired, serve potatoes drizzled with some of remaining oil.

Combine first 8 ingredients in glass baking dish. Marinate 2 hours at room temperature or up to 8 hours in refrigerator.
Drain lamb, reserving marinade. Add vegetables to marinade and toss well. Thread lamb on skewers, alternating with vegetables. Prepare barbecue or preheat broiler. Brush kebabs with additional olive oil. Season with salt and pepper. Grill or broil until lamb is slightly charred on outside and pink on inside and vegetables are tender, turning occasionally, about 5 minutes.

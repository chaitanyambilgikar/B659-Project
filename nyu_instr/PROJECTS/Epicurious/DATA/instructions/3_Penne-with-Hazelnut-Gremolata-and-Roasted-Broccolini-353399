Mix hazelnuts, chopped parsley, finely grated lemon peel, and garlic in small bowl. DO AHEAD: Gremolata can be made 2 hours ahead. Cover and refrigerate.
Cook pasta in large saucepan of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally. Drain; return to saucepan. Add broccolini and toss over medium heat to rewarm. Transfer to medium bowl. Add gremolata and remaining 1 tablespoon oil; toss to distribute evenly. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

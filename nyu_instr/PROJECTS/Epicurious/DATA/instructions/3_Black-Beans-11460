In a large bowl let the beans soak in enough cold water to cover them by 2 inches for 1 hour and drain them. In a large heavy saucepan simmer the beans in enough cold water to cover them by 1 inch, uncovered, adding more water as necessary to keep the beans barely covered, for 1 to 2 hours, or until they are tender. Add the salt and simmer the beans for 5 minutes.
While the beans are cooking, in a heavy skillet cook the onion, the bell peppers, the garlic, and the cumin in the oil over moderately low heat, stirring, until the vegetables are softened, add the tomato paste, and cook the mixture, stirring, for 2 minutes. Stir the vegetable mixture into the beans, add the vinegar and salt and pepper to taste, and simmer the mixture, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes, or until it is thickened to the desired consistency. The beans may be prepared up to this point 2 days in advance, kept covered and chilled, and reheated, adding additional water if necessary. Transfer the beans to a serving bowl and sprinkle them with the scallion and the coriander.

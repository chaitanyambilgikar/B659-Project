For shellfish: Combine first 9 ingredients in large pot. Bring to boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer 10 minutes to allow flavors to develop. Add clams to broth in pot; increase heat and bring to boil. Cover and cook until clams open, 6 to 8 minutes. Using tongs or slotted spoon, transfer clams to large bowl (discard any that do not open). Add mussels to boiling broth in same pot; cover and cook until mussels open, 4 to 5 minutes. Using tongs or slotted spoon, transfer mussels to bowl with clams (discard any that do not open); cool slightly. Discard broth. Remove clams and mussels from shells; discard shells.
Place lobster tails on steamer rack set in large pot filled with just enough water to reach bottom of steamer rack. Bring water to boil. Cover; steam until just cooked through, 7 to 8 minutes. Transfer lobster to bowl of ice water and cool 10 minutes. Using kitchen shears, cut shell of 1 lobster tail open and remove lobster meat from tail; discard shells. Repeat with second lobster tail. Cut meat into 1/2-inch pieces. DO AHEAD: Seafood can be cooked 4 hours ahead. Cover separately; chill.
For butter broth: Bring 1/4 cup water to boil in heavy large saucepan. Add butter, 2 pieces at a time, whisking until butter is melted but not brown before adding more. Reduce heat to low. Add clams, mussels, lobster, and crab; stir over medium-low heat until shellfish is heated through, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with parsley.
For honey emulsion: Combine 1 cup water and honey in medium saucepan. Bring to boil, whisking occasionally until honey dissolves. Remove from heat; add egg yolk and blend mixture with immersion blender until very foamy, 2 to 3 minutes.
Divide shellfish mixture among small bowls. Top each serving with small spoonful of honey emulsion; serve immediately.
What to drink:Pop a bottle of bubbly. Try the Pierre Peters NV Brut Blanc de Blancs Champagne (France, $53).

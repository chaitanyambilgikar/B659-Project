Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease a 9 x 9-inch baking pan lined with foil.
Beat the butter, granulated sugar, 1 egg yolk, and 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla in a medium bowl until well blended.
Stir in 3/4 cup of flour until well blended and smooth.
Press the dough evenly into the baking pan. Bake for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, beat 2 eggs, light brown sugar, 1 1/2 tablespoons flour, baking powder, salt, and 1 1/2 teaspoons of vanilla in a medium bowl until well combined.
Stir in nuts and coconut.
Spread the mixture evenly over the hot baked crust. Bake until the top is firm and golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out slightly wet, 20 to 25 minutes. Set the pan on a rack. If desired, while the bars are still warm, spread evenly with Lemon Glaze (recipe below).
Let stand until the bars are cool and the glaze is set.
For lemon glaze: Beat confectioners' sugar, juice, and vanilla together until smooth.

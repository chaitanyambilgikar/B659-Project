For Brioche Croutons: Preheat the oven to 300º F.
Place the rounds on a baking sheet and drizzle or brush with a little olive oil. Sprinkle lightly with kosher salt. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes, or until an even golden brown.
For the Salmon: Peel the celery stalks, squaring off the rounded side of the stalks as you peel. Slice the celery lengthwise on a mandoline and cut the slices into fine julienne about 1 inch long.
Blanch the celery in boiling salted water until tender, drain it in a strainer, and place the strainer in an ice-water bath. When the celery is cold, drain, dry on paper towels, and sprinkle with salt to taste. You should have about 1/4 cup of celery.
Heat about 1/8 inch of canola oil in a large skillet. Season the salmon with salt and white pepper. When the oil is hot, add the salmon fillets skin side down and cook for about 1 minute, then turn over and cook for another minute. "Kiss," or briefly cook, the sides of the pieces. Remove the cooked salmon and keep warm.
For the sauce: Bring the water to a boil in a small saucepan. Reduce the heat to low and whisk in the butter to emulsify. After adding the last of the butter, whisk in the white truffle oil. Remove the butter from the heat and vigorously whisk in the heavy cream to create a slight froth. Season with salt.
Spoon 1 tablespoon of the sauce into the center of each of six bowls. Arrange three small nests of celery, equally spaced, around each pool of the sauce. Top each nest with a slice of truffle. Place a crouton in the center of the sauce and top with a piece of salmon, skin side up. Garnish each fillet with julienned truffle and a sprig of chervil. Sprinkle the dish lightly with salt.

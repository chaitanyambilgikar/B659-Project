1. Sprinkle the bread with 2 tablespoons of the oil. Toast the slices until crusty and golden.
2. Heat the remaining oil in a large skillet, then add the garlic and sage and stir until the garlic begins to brown, about 1 minute.
3. Add the tomatoes, beans, salt, and pepper and stir to combine. Cook until the liquid is reduced and the soup is slightly thickened, a few more minutes.
4. Serve, placing a slice of toast into each soup bowl or generously spooning the beans and broth right over the bread, if the kids will let you.

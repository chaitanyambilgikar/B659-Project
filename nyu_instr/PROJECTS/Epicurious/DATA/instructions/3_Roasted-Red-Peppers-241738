Rub outsides of peppers with oil, then arrange peppers, cut sides down, in 1 layer in a large shallow baking pan.
Preheat broiler
Broil peppers 4 to 5 inches from heat until well charred (peppers will not char evenly, especially at ends), 20 to 25 minutes.
Transfer to a bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap, then let stand about 20 minutes.
When peppers are cool enough to handle, peel off skin. Chop peppers and reserve 1/4 cup for saffron rouille (if making) or for another use.

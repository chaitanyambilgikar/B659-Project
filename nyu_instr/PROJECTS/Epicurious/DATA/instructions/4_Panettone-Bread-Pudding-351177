Soak raisins in hot brandy 15 minutes, then drain (discard brandy or reserve for making biscotti; recipe follows).
Meanwhile, butter panettone on both sides and cook in batches in a large heavy skillet over medium heat until golden brown on both sides.
Whisk together remaining ingredients.
Tear panettone into bite-size pieces and spread evenly in a buttered 13-by 9-inch baking dish. Scatter raisins over top, then pour in egg mixture. Let stand 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350°F with rack in middle.
Bake until pudding is golden and just set, 35 to 40 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.

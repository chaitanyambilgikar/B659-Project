In a blender grind the dried corn until it resembles coarse meal. In a bowl whisk together the ground corn, the salt, the sugar, and the milk and let the mixture stand at room temperature for 1 hour. Whisk in the baking powder, the eggs, the scallion greens, the corn kernels, and pepper to taste, pour the batter into sixteen 1/2-cup metal charlotte molds coated with non-stick spray, and bake the puddings on a baking sheet in the middle of a preheated 375°F. oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the centers comes out clean. (Alternatively, the pudding may be baked in a buttered 1 1/2-quart shallow baking dish.) Let the puddings cool for 5 minutes and run a thin knife around the side of each pudding. Invert the puddings, 1 at a time, onto a spatula, invert them onto a platter, and garnish them with the rosemary.

1. Stock up: Good gravy begins with good stock. At least one day (and up to four days) before the feast, make your own rich turkey stock. (For a recipe, see Do- Ahead Turkey Stock ; in a pinch, you can use store-bought low-salt chicken broth, but the results with homemade are incomparable.) When you're ready to make the gravy, bring 4 cups stock to a boil in a medium pot. Remove from heat; keep warm.
2. Make a roux: Melt 4 tablespoons unsalted butter or turkey fat in a large heavy saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in 1/4 cup all-purpose flour and cook, whisking, for 1 minute. The roux will become smooth and golden brown. Keep whisking! Within 2–3 minutes it will be the color of café au lait and smell slightly toasted. Gradually whisk in the warm turkey stock, bring to a boil, then lower the heat so the gravy's at a bare simmer.
3. Customize it: Now, for an herbaceous kick, add 2 bay leaves or 1 sprig thyme. For an umami boost, stir in 4 dried porcini mushrooms or 2 teaspoons porcini powder along with 2 tablespoons Madeira. With or without these upgrades, let gravy simmer until reduced by half, then remove herbs or mushrooms with a slotted spoon. Season with kosher salt and serve. Or keep the gravy warm until the turkey is finished and take it one step furtherâ€¦
4. Extra credit: Transfer the turkey to a cutting board and strain the drippings from the pan into a measuring cup. Skim the fat; add enough water to measure 1 cup. Place the pan across two burners set on medium-high heat. Add the drippings mixture and deglaze the pan, stirring and scraping up any browned bits with a wooden spoon. Strain into the gravy; simmer until slightly thickened, 10 minutes. Season to taste with salt and serve.

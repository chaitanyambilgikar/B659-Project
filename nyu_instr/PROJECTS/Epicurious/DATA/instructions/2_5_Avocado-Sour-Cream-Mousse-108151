Coarsely mash avocados with a fork in a large bowl. Stir in gelatin mixture along with remaining ingredients until combined well.
Pour mixture into lightly oiled mold and chill, covered tightly with plastic wrap, until firm, at least 4 hours.
Run tip of a thin knife between mold and mousse. Tilt mold sideways and tap side of mold against a work surface, turning it, to evenly break seal and loosen mousse. Keeping mold tilted, invert a plate over mold, then invert mousse onto plate.

Whip cream to stiff peaks. Place lemon curd in medium bowl. Stir in 1/2 of whipped cream. Fold in remaining cream. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
Preheat oven to 350°F. Roll pastry out on lightly floured surface to 14x11-inch rectangle. Cut 4 1-inch-wide strips off short side and 4 1-inch strips off long side. Transfer pastry rectangle to ungreased cookie sheet. Pierce with fork. Brush with some of egg glaze. Arrange 1 pastry strip on each edge of rectangle so outside edges meet, trimming as necessary, forming tart edges. Brush top of strips with egg glaze. Repeat with remaining pastry strips. Brush top of strips with egg and sprinkle with sugar. Bake tart 5 minutes. Pierce with fork if puffed. Continue baking until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Cool completely.
Spread cream mixture in tart. Arrange strawberries atop lemon cream in rows, cut side down.

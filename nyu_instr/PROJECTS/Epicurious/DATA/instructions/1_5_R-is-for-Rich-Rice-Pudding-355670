1. Combine the rice, milk and sugar in a heavy small saucepan, cover, and bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce the heat to low and simmer gently for 15 minutes.
2. Beat the eggs with a fork in a heatproof medium bowl. Add half of the hot rice mixture and mix well to blend. Transfer that mixture back to the saucepan and stir over low heat until steaming hot but not boiling. Transfer the pudding to a food processor and process for 1 minute. (The mixture will still have texture.) Scrape the pudding into a clean bowl and chill for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally, before serving. Cover any remaining pudding after it has cooled.

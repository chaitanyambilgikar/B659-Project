Prick sausages several times with the tip of a small knife. Heat 1/2 tablespoon butter in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until foam subsides, then brown sausages, turning occasionally, about 3 minutes total. Transfer to a plate.
Add remaining 2 1/2 tablespoons butter to skillet along with onion, bay leaves, caraway seeds, and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is softened and beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Stir in sauerkraut, cider, and sugar, then nestle sausages into mixture. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, partially covered, 20 minutes.

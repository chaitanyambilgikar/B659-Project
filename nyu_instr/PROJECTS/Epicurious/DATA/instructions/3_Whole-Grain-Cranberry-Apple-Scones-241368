Preheat oven to 375°F. Line large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Combine first 8 ingredients in large bowl; whisk to blend. Using back of fork, cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add cranberries and apples and toss to distribute evenly. Whisk 1/2 cup buttermilk, juice concentrate, and egg to blend in small bowl. Gradually add buttermilk mixture to dry ingredients, tossing until evenly moistened.
Turn dough out onto lightly floured work surface. Gently knead 2 or 3 turns to bind. Divide dough in half. Pat out each half to 6-inch-diameter, 3/4-inch-thick round. Cut each round into 6 wedges. Arrange scones on prepared sheet, spacing at least 1 inch apart. Brush scones with buttermilk to glaze, then sprinkle with coarse sugar.
Bake scones until puffed and brown and tester inserted into centers comes out clean, about 22 minutes. Serve warm.

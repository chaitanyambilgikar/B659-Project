Trim asparagus and have ready a large bowl of ice and cold water. In a large saucepan of boiling salted water cook asparagus until just tender, 3 to 4 minutes, and with tongs transfer to ice water to stop cooking. Drain asparagus well in a colander and pat dry.
Gently toss asparagus with vinaigrette and salt and pepper to taste.

Bring a 6-quart pot of salted water (2 teaspoon salt for 5 qt water) to a simmer.
Meanwhile, whisk together flour, dill, 2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a large bowl.
Whisk together eggs and water in a bowl, then add to flour mixture and whisk until batter is smooth.
Working over barely simmering water, force batter through spaetzlemaker (or through colander with a rubber spatula) into water and cook, stirring occasionally, until dumplings have risen to surface and are firm, 2 to 3 minutes.
Drain dumplings in a colander, then return to warm pot. Toss with butter and salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately.

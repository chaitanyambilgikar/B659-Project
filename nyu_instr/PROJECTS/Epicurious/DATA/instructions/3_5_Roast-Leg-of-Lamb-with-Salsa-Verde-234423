Stir first 10 ingredients in large bowl for salsa verde. Place lamb on work surface, smooth-side down. Sprinkle lamb with salt and pepper, then garlic. Rub 1/4 cup salsa verde into lamb. Roll up lamb. Using kitchen string, tie lamb every 2-inches to hold together. (Lamb and salsa verde can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover separately and chill. Let lamb and salsa verde stand at room temperature 1 hour before continuing.)
Preheat oven to 450°F. Place lamb on rack in roasting pan. Roast until thermometer inserted into thickest part of lamb registers 120°F for medium-rare, about 1 hour and 20 minutes. Let stand at room temperature 15 minutes. Transfer lamb to cutting board; remove kitchen string. Cut crosswise into thin slices. Arrange sliced lamb on platter. Spoon some salsa verde over. Serve lamb, passing remaining salsa alongside.

Freeze feta, wrapped in plastic wrap, 30 minutes (to facilitate slicing). Cut feta into 1/3-inch-thick slices and gently pat dry between paper towels.
Spread flour and bread crumbs on 2 separate plates. In a shallow bowl beat egg lighty. Working with 1 slice at a time, dredge feta gently in flour, brushing off excess, and dip in egg, letting excess drip off. Coat feta with bread crumbs and transfer to a wax-paper-lined tray. Chill feta 15 minutes.
In a small saucepan bring tomato sauce to a bare simmer and keep warm.
In a large non-stick skillet heat oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and sauté feta in batches 1 to 2 minutes on each side, or until golden. Transfer feta with a slotted spatula to plates. Squeeze lemon over feta to taste and sprinkle with pepper. Serve feta with tomato sauce.

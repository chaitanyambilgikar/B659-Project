Preheat oven to 375°F. Butter six 6-ounce (3/4-cup) soufflé dishes or custard cups. Stir butter and chocolate in medium saucepan over low heat until melted and smooth. Cool to room temperature.
Using electric mixer, beat eggs, yolks and sugar in large bowl until foamy and pale, and slowly dissolving ribbon forms when beaters are lifted, about 5 minutes. Add flour; beat until just blended. Stir in chocolate. Pour into prepared dishes.
Place dishes on baking sheet. Bake until cakes are firm around edges but still move slightly in center when shaken, about 12 minutes (do not overbake). Cool 5 minutes, then invert onto serving plates. Serve warm with ice cream.

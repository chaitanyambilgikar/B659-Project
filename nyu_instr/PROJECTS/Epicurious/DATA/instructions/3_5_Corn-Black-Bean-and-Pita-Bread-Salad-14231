Preheat oven to 375° F.
Halve pitas horizontally and sprinkle rough sides with salt and pepper to taste. On a baking sheet toast pitas, rough sides up, in middle of oven until golden, about 5 minutes, and break into bite-size pieces. Rinse and drain beans in a colander.
In a kettle cover corn with water and bring to a boil. Drain corn and when cool enough to handle cut kernels from cobs into a bowl. Add pita pieces, beans, remaining ingredients, and salt and pepper to taste and toss to combine.

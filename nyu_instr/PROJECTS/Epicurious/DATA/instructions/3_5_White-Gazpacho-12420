Make croutons: Preheat oven to 350°F.
In a bowl toss bread cubes with oil and salt to taste and spread on a small baking sheet. Bake cubes in middle of oven until golden and crisp, 8 to 10 minutes.
Make gazpacho: Drain soaked bread and squeeze out water. In a blender blend bread with remaining ingredients until smooth. Season gazpacho with salt and pepper and transfer to a metal bowl set in a larger bowl of ice and cold water. Stir gazpacho occasionally until chilled, about 10 minutes. Serve gazpacho topped with croutons.

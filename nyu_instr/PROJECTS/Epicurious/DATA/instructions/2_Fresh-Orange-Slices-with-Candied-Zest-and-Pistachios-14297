With a vegetable peeler remove zest from oranges in strips (about 2 by 1/2 by 1/4 inches) and in a small heavy saucepan simmer strips in water to cover 10 minutes.
With a sharp knife cut a slice from top and bottom of each orange to expose flesh and arrange, a cut side down, on a cutting board. Cutting from top to bottom, remove peel and pith. Cut oranges crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices and arrange on 2 dessert plates.
Drain zest in a sieve and return to pan. Simmer zest with sugar and 1/2 cup water over moderately low heat 10 minutes, or until zest is translucent and syrup is thickened. Add liqueur and simmer 1 minute.
Arrange candied zest decoratively on and around orange slices and top with syrup. Sprinkle oranges with pistachios.

For Cake: Position rack in center of oven and preheat oven to 350°F. Line bottom of 10-inch-diameter springform pan with foil; brush foil with oil. Cut cardboard into 9-inch round. Wrap with foil.
Using electric mixer, beat egg whites and salt in large bowl until soft peaks form. Gradually add 1/2 cup sugar and beat until stiff glossy peaks form. In another large bowl, beat egg yolks, remaining 1/2 cup sugar, vegetable oil, orange juice concentrate, orange peel and lemon juice until blended. Sift cake meal and potato starch over yolk mixture and beat at low speed just until blended. Gently fold whites into yolk mixture in 2 additions.
Transfer batter to prepared pan. Bake cake until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Cool cake in pan on rack. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and let stand at room temperature.)
For Glaze: Melt margarine in heavy large saucepan over low heat. Add chocolate and stir until melted and smooth. Mix in orange juice concentrate and honey. Let cool until thickened but still spreadable, about 2 hours.
Cut around pan sides to loosen cake. Release sides. Cut cake in half horizontally, leaving cake bottom on pan bottom. Place top half of cake, top side down, on foil-wrapped cardboard round. Spread 1 1/3 cups chocolate glaze over. Place bottom half of cake, pan side up, onto glaze. Remove pan bottom; peel off foil. Spread 1 cup chocolate glaze in thin layer over entire cake, anchoring crumbs. Refrigerate cake 30 minutes.
Rewarm remaining chocolate glaze over very low heat until just pourable. Place rack on baking sheet; place cake on rack. Pour glaze over cake, coating entirely and smoothing sides with metal spatula. Chill cake on rack until glaze is firm. Transfer to platter. (Reserve glaze on sheet for another use.) (Can be made 3 days ahead. Cover and chill. Let stand at room temperature 1 hour before servings.)
Garnish cake with flowers and orange peel strips if desired.

In a saucepan simmer the sun-dried tomatoes in 2 inches water for 3 minutes, or until they are tender, drain them, and mince them. In a bowl whisk together the tomatoes, the vinegars, and the garlic paste, add the oil in a stream, whisking, and whisk the vinaigrette until it is emulsified. Stir in the basil.

Simmer wine, sugar, and zest in a 2- to 3-quart saucepan, stirring occasionally, 4 minutes.
Meanwhile, put 1 cup water in a small bowl and sprinkle with gelatin. Let gelatin stand 1 minute to soften.
Discard zest from wine mixture, then add gelatin mixture and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, just until gelatin has dissolved. Remove from heat and stir in elderflower syrup and remaining cup water. Pour into a 13- by 9-inch glass baking dish and chill, covered, until softly set, at least 8 hours.
Scoop melon balls with cutter and divide among glasses. Cut jelly into squares and serve over melon.

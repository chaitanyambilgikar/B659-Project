Melt butter in heavy medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Add onion and sauté until tender, about 8 minutes. Add flour and stir 2 minutes. Gradually mix in broth. Add peas and chopped tarragon. Simmer until peas are very tender, about 15 minutes. Drain peas, reserving broth. Puree peas in processor. Add 1/2 cup broth and puree until smooth. Gradually blend in remaining broth. Transfer to medium bowl and refrigerate until well chilled. (Can be made 1 day ahead.)
Season soup to taste with salt and pepper. Ladle into bowls. Garnish each with small amount of crème fraîche and tarragon leaves and serve.

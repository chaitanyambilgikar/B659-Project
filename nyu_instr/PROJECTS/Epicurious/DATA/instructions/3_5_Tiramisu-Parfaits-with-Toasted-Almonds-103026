Combine 1/2 cup coffee liqueur, 1/2 cup water, 1/4 cup dark corn syrup, 2 tablespoons instant espresso powder and 2 tablespoons powdered sugar in small bowl. Blend well.
Combine 5 tablespoons espresso syrup, 1/2 cup powdered sugar and 8 ounces cream cheese in large bowl. Using electric mixer, beat until smooth and fluffy. Beat 1 1/2 cups chilled whipping cream and remaining 1/4 cup powdered sugar in another large bowl until stiff peaks form. Fold whipped cream into cream cheese mixture. Place 1 pound-cake slice in bottom of each of 6 parfait glasses or wine goblets, tearing and pressing pound cake to fit. Drizzle 1 tablespoon espresso syrup over each. Spread 1/3 cup cream cheese filling over each. Repeat layering with remaining pound cake, espresso syrup and cream cheese filling. Sift unsweetened cocoa powder generously over parfaits. Cover parfaits and refrigerate at least 6 hours or overnight. Top parfaits with toasted sliced almonds and serve.

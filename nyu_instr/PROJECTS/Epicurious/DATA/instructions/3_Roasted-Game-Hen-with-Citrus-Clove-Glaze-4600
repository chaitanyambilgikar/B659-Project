Preheat oven to 450°F. Arrange lemon slices on baking sheet in two 3 x 5-inch rectangles. Season Cornish game hen halves generously with salt and pepper. Place game hen halves, skin side up atop rectangles of lemon slices. Roast game hen halves 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine orange marmalade, fresh lemon juice, bourbon, grated lemon peel and ground cloves in heavy small saucepan. Simmer marmalade mixture over medium heat until thickened to consistency of glaze, about 4 minutes. Season marmalade glaze to taste with salt and pepper.
Brush game hen halves with marmalade glaze. Continue to roast hen halves until juices run clear when thighs are pierced and hen halves are deep brown, brushing 2 more times with marmalade glaze, about 10 minutes longer. Serve immediately.

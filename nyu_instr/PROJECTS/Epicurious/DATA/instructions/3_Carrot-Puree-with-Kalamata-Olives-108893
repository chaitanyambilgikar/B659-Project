Cover carrots and garlic with salted water by 1 inch in a 2- to 3-quart saucepan and boil, partially covered, until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain well in a colander, then purée carrots and garlic in a blender or food processor with butter and broth until very smooth.
Transfer purée to saucepan and add olives, then cook over low heat, stirring frequently, just until hot.

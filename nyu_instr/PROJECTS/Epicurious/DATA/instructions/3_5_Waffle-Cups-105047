Blend all ingredients in a blender at low speed until totally smooth, about 1 minute. Chill batter, covered, 1 hour.
Heat pizzella maker and lightly brush top and bottom with oil. Pour a generous tablespoon batter on each side (left and right) of pizzella maker and spread quickly with back of a spoon to cover molds. Close cover and cook until golden, about 1 1/2 minutes.
Working quickly (pizzella is pliable only while still hot), peel off 1 pizzella and fit into 1 large ramekin, then press a small ramekin inside to shape pizzella. Shape second pizzella using second pair of ramekins. Remove ramekins when waffle cups are hardened, about 2 minutes. Make more waffle cups with remaining batter.

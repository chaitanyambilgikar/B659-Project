Cook asparagus in large saucepan of boiling salted water until crisp-tender, about 2 minutes. Drain. Transfer asparagus to bowl of ice water. Drain well. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Wrap asparagus in paper towels; place in resealable plastic bag and chill.
Preheat oven to 425°F. Heat 2 tablespoons peanut oil in heavy large ovenproof skillet or wide pot with lid over medium-high heat. Add morels and saut° until tender and browned, about 8 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer morels to bowl (do not clean skillet).
Heat 1 tablespoon peanut oil in same skillet over high heat. Sprinkle veal chops with flour, salt, and pepper. Add veal chops to skillet; cook until browned, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to plate. Add remaining 1 tablespoon peanut oil to same skillet; add shallot halves, 6 whole sage leaves, thyme sprigs, and bay leaves to skillet and saut until shallots are softened, about 6 minutes. Return veal chops to skillet; cover and roast in oven until tender, about 12 minutes. Transfer chops and shallot mixture to plate. Add remaining peanut oil to skillet; add 1/3 cup minced shallots, sliced sage leaves, and garlic and sauté 3 minutes. Add asparagus, morels, and broth; simmer until asparagus is tender, about 5 minutes. Return veal chops to skillet, cover, and cook just until heated through and liquid is slightly reduced, about 3 minutes. Transfer veal chops, morel-asparagus mixture, and pan juices to plates. Sprinkle with chopped chives and serve.
What to Drink: A lighter-style Pinot Noir would be great with the veal chops. We like the earthy, dark berry flavors of the Domaine Jean Grivot 2004 "Les Charmois" Nuits-St.-Georges ($47).

Make seasoned salt: Stir together all seasoned salt ingredients in a small bowl.
Soak potatoes: Cut potatoes lengthwise into thin matchsticks, about 1/8 inch thick, using a mandoline or other manual slicer, and submerge in a bowl of ice water until ready to fry.
Fry potatoes: Heat oil in a 4-quart heavy saucepan over moderately high heat until it registers 375°F on deep-fat thermometer. While oil is heating, drain potatoes in a colander and dry well with paper towels. Fry potatoes in 4 batches, stirring, until golden, 4 to 5 minutes (return oil to 375°F between batches), transferring each batch with a slotted spoon to a baking sheet lined with paper towels to drain. While still warm, toss each batch with one fourth of seasoned salt.

Preheat the oven to 350°F. Cream the butter with both types of sugar in a bowl, then beat in the egg and vanilla. Combine the flour, baking powder and a pinch of salt in another bowl, then sift into the creamed mixture, beating constantly with a wooden spoon. If necessary, soften the mixture with a little milk. Stir in the hazelnuts and chocolate. Place about 15 tablespoons of the mixture, spaced well apart, on an ungreased cookie sheet and bake for about 7-8 minutes. Remove the cookie sheet from the oven and let cool slightly, then remove the cookies with a spatula and let cool on a wire rack. Cook the remaining mixture in the same way.

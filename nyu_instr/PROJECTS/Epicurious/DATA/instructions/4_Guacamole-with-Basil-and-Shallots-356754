Place avocados in large bowl; add lemon juice. Using fork or potato masher, crush avocados coarsely. Mix in 1/2 cup chopped basil and shallots. Season to taste with salt and pepper. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 hour ahead. Cover and chill.
Transfer guacamole to serving bowl. Garnish with basil leaves. Place on platter. Arrange toasts and crudités around bowl.
What to drink: With the appetizers, put out a couple of options. Prosecco (Italy's answer to Champagne) is always a good choice. For this party, Kate and Scott poured Botter NV Verduzzo Prosecco Frizzante ($17), a light-bodied sparkler from the Veneto region. They also offered Peroni Nastro Azzurro ($9 for a six-pack), a dry Italian lager with hoppy aromas.

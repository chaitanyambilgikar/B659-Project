Preheat oven to 200°F with rack in middle. Stir together pepper, brown sugar, salt, and paprika. Pat ribs dry. Rub beef all over with spice mixture.
Arrange beef in 1 layer in a large roasting pan. Bake, uncovered, until meat is tender, about 6 hours. Cut into ribs and serve immediately. Stir juice into sauce before serving.

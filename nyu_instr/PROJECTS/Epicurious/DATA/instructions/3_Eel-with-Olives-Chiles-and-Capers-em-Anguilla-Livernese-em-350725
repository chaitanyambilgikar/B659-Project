3. Meanwhile, season the eel with salt and pepper and arrange in a single layer in a baking dish.
4. Pour the sauce over the eel, put the dish in the oven, and bake for about 20 minutes, until the eel is cooked through. Transfer to a warmed platter, sprinkle with the chopped fennel, and serve immediately.

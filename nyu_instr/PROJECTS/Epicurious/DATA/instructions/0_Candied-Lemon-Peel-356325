Place rack on rimmed baking sheet. Cut 1/4 inch off top and bottom of each lemon. Score each lemon lengthwise in quarters, cutting just through peel (not into flesh). Carefully pull off each peel quarter in 1 piece. Cut each quarter lengthwise into 1/4-inch-wide strips. Cook peel in large saucepan of boiling water 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Drain peel; rinse well and drain again.
Bring 4 cups water and 4 cups sugar to boil in heavy large saucepan, stirring to dissolve sugar completely. Add drained lemon peel to saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until lemon peel is very soft and looks translucent, about 40 minutes.
Using fork, transfer lemon peel, 2 or 3 strips at a time, to prepared rack. Separate strips and arrange crosswise on rack. Let peel drain 15 minutes. Sprinkle peel generously with additional sugar. Turn strips over and sprinkle second side generously with sugar. Let dry uncovered overnight. DO AHEAD: Candied lemon peel can be made up to 1 week ahead. Cover and refrigerate.
Gifts from the kitchen: Consider making a double batch of the Candied Lemon Peel to give as holiday gifts. Wrap some of the sparkly strips of peel in cellophane and tie with a ribbon. Add a tag that suggests chopping the peel and sprinkling it over vanilla ice cream or using it in a favorite scone or muffin recipe. For a more decadent treat, dip the candied peel partially in melted dark chocolate. Place the strips on aluminum-foil-lined baking sheets and chill until the chocolate sets.

In a large saucepan of boiling water blanch the lemons for 30 seconds, drain them, and rinse them under cold water. Trim the ends of the lemons, discarding them, and cut the lemons crosswise into paper-thin slices. In a bowl cover the lemon slices with the sugar and let the mixture stand, stirring once after 1 hour, for 8 hours or overnight.
Preheat the oven to 425°F. Roll out half the dough 1/8 inch thick on a lightly floured surface, fit it into a 9-inch (1-quart) pie plate, and trim the edge, leaving a 1/2-inch overhang. Remove the lemon slices from the sugar and arrange them in the shell. Add the eggs and salt to the sugar, whisk the mixture until it is combined well, and pour it over the lemon slices.
Roll out the remaining dough into a 12-inch round on a lightly floured surface, drape it over the filling, and trim it, leaving a 1-inch overhang. Fold the overhang under the bottom crust, pressing the edge to seal it, and crimp the edge decoratively. Cut slits in the crust with a sharp knife, forming steam vents, and bake the pie in the middle of the oven for 25 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 350°F. and bake the pie for 20 to 25 minutes more, or until the crust is golden. Let the pie cool on a rack and serve it warm at room temperature.

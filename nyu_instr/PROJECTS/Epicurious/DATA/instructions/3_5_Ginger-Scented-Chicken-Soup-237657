Coarsely chop enough cilantro leaves to measure 1/2 cup, then coarsely chop enough stems to measure 1 cup.
Simmer cilantro stems, finely chopped ginger, chicken, scallions, water, rice wine, and salt in a 6- to 8-quart pot, covered, skimming fat occasionally, 1 1/2 hours.
Transfer chicken to a bowl and cool to warm.
While chicken cools, pour broth through a sieve into a large bowl, discarding solids. Return broth to pot, then add carrots and ginger matchsticks and boil, uncovered, until carrots are tender, 10 to 15 minutes.
Shred chicken, discarding skin and bones. Add noodles to soup and boil, stirring occasionally, until noodles are tender, about 8 minutes.
Stir in chicken, chopped cilantro leaves, and salt to taste.

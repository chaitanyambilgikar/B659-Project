In a bowl whisk together the mashed whole egg and yolk, the mustard, and the vinegar and add the oil in a stream, whisking until the dressing is emulsified. Stir in the cornichons, the tarragon, and salt and pepper to taste. The dressing keeps, covered and chilled, for several days. Serve the dressing with cold meat, poultry, or vegetables.

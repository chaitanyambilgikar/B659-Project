Heat oil in a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Add pancetta and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, 3-5 minutes. Add onion and cook until just soft, about 5 minutes. Stir in breadcrumbs, parsley, and red pepper flakes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Toast, stirring often, until breadcrumbs are golden, 4-5 minutes. Add prunes and cook, stirring often, until breadcrumbs are deep golden brown and crisp, 3-4 minutes longer. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve warm.

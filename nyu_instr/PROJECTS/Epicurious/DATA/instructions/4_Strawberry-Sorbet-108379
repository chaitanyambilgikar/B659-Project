Cut any large strawberries in half. Arrange the strawberries on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and place in the freezer for 2 hours, or until the berries are completely hard frozen. Put the berries in a food processor along with the sugar and pulse the machine on and off until the fruit is broken up. Add the water and continue to run the blades until you achieve a smooth purée. Transfer the sorbet to a quart container and freeze for 2 hours, or until just firm enough to scoop. Serve in frozen ice cream glasses.

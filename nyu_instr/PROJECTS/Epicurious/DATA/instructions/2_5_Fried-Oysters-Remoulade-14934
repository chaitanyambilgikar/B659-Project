Transfer oysters to a bowl and chill, covered. Clean and dry oyster shells. Line a shallow baking pan with a double layer of paper towels.
Make rémoulade: Finely chop cornichons or dill pickles and in a bowl whisk together with remaining rémoulade ingredients and salt to taste until combined well. Transfer rémoulade to a serving bowl.
In a 4-quart heavy saucepan heat oil over moderate heat until a deep-fat thermometer registers 375°F.
Preheat oven to 200°F.
In a blender blend cornmeal 30 seconds, or until it is powdery, and in a bowl season cornmeal with salt. Drain oysters in a colander and dip each in cornmeal to lightly coat, transferring to a plate. Working in batches of 6, fry oysters, until golden, about 2 minutes. With a slotted spoon transfer oysters as fried to baking pan and keep warm in oven. Return oil to 375°F. between batches.
Serve oysters on shells with rémoulade.

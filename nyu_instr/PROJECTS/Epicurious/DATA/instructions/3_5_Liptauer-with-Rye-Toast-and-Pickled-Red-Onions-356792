Mash garlic and 1/2 teaspoon coarse salt in small bowl with back of spoon until paste forms. Using electric mixer, beat butter in medium bowl until smooth and creamy. Add garlic paste, quark, and next 6 ingredients; fold to combine. Season with salt and more vinegar, if desired. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Let stand at room temperature 1 hour, then stir before using.
Serve with rye toast and drained Pickled Red Onions.
* A slightly tangy, soft unripened cow’s-milk cheese; available at some supermarkets and at specialty foods stores (such as Whole Foods markets) and natural foods stores.
** Tiny brine-packed French pickles; available at some supermarkets and at specialty foods stores.
What to drink: Pair the flavorful Liptauer with a big white Austrian wine. We like the Hiedler 2008 "L&eouml;ss" Gr&euuml;ner Veltliner ($16), a yeasty wine with a nice acidity.

Place all ingredients except onions in heavy large pot. Bring to boil over high heat. Add onions; reduce heat to medium and simmer until crisp-tender, about 10 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer onions to jar with lid. Increase heat to high and boil until liquid is reduced to 1 3/4 cups, about 20 minutes. Pour liquid over onions and cool.
Cover onion mixture and refrigerate until flavors blend, at least 1 week and up to 1 month.

In a blender or food processor blend all crêpe ingredients except chives and butter until smooth and transfer to a bowl. Let batter stand at room temperature, covered, 1 hour. Batter may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.
Add chives to batter and stir well. Heat a 6-inch non-stick skillet over moderate heat until hot. Brush skillet lightly with some butter and remove from heat. Half fill a 1/4-cup measure with batter and pour into skillet, tilting and rotating skillet quickly to cover bottom.
Cook crêpe until underside is golden and top appears almost dry, about 30 seconds. Turn crêpe over with a thin spatula and cook until underside is golden, 15 to 20 seconds more. Slide crêpe onto a kitchen towel and cool. Make more crêpes with remaining batter in same manner, brushing skillet lightly with butter for each crêpe and stacking cooked crêpes on another kitchen towel after they cool. Crêpes may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, stacked between sheets of wax paper and wrapped well in plastic wrap. Bring crêpes to room temperature before using.

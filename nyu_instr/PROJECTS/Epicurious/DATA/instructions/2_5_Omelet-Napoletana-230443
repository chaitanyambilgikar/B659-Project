Cook spaghetti in a 6-quart pot of boiling until al dente. Drain well in a colander, then return to pot and immediately toss with 2 tablespoons butter.
Lightly whisk together eggs, oil, milk, nutmeg, salt, pepper, ham, and mozzarella in a bowl.
Preheat broiler.
Heat remaining 2 tablespoons butter in a flameproof 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderate heat until foam subsides, then cook egg mixture, lifting up cooked edges with a heatproof spatula to let raw egg flow underneath, until set on bottom and almost set but still moist on top, 3 to 5 minutes. Arrange spaghetti over eggs, pressing lightly with spatula to help pasta settle into eggs, then sprinkle with Parmigiano-Reggiano.
Broil omelet 4 to 6 inches from heat until top is pale golden, 2 to 3 minutes.

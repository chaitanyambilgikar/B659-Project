Preheat oven to 350°F. Blend macaroons in processor to coarse crumbs. Spread crumbs on bottom of 13 x 9 x 2-inch glass baking dish. Spoon peaches, pears, pineapple, apricots, and bananas over crumbs. Spoon pie filling over fruit. Process pecans, sugar, flour, and cinnamon in processor until pecans are finely chopped. Add butter. Process until mixture resembles fine meal. Sprinkle over pie filling.
Bake crisp until heated through and bubbling at edges, about 1 hour.

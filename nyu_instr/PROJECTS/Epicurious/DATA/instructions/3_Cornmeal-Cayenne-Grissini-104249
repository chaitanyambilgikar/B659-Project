Stir together warm water and yeast and let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes.
Stir together flour, cornmeal, table salt, and cayenne in a large bowl, then stir in yeast mixture and oil just until a dough forms.
Turn out dough onto an unfloured work surface and knead until smooth and elastic, 8 to 10 minutes.
Transfer dough to an oiled bowl and turn to coat. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let dough rise in a warm place 1 hour, or until doubled in bulk.
Preheat oven to 350°F.
Punch down dough and turn out onto unfloured work surface. Roll 2-teaspoon portions of dough into 10-inch-long sticks and arrange about 3/4inch apart on greased baking sheets.
Brush sticks lightly with oil and sprinkle with kosher salt.
Bake in batches in upper and lower thirds of oven, switching position of sheets halfway through baking, until sticks are crisp and ends are golden, 22 to 25 minutes total. Transfer to racks to cool.

Cook onion in oil in a 3- to 4-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 5 minutes. Stir in remaining ingredients and simmer, uncovered, stirring more frequently toward end of cooking, until plums fall apart and sauce is thickened, about 1 hour. Cool to room temperature. Serve with pork or chicken.

Make marinade: Crush juniper berries and mince garlic cloves. In a large bowl stir together garlic, wine, and juniper berries.
Trim lamb and cut into 2-inch cubes. Stir lamb into marinade. Marinate lamb, covered and chilled, at least 12 hours and up to 1 day. In a large sieve set over a bowl drain lamb, reserving marinade.
Chop onions and mince garlic. In an 8-quart heavy kettle heat oil over moderate heat until hot but not smoking and cook onions with garlic, cinnamon, and saffron, stirring occasionally, until onions are softened. With a slotted spoon transfer onion mixture to a large bowl.
Pat lamb dry and season with salt and pepper. In kettle brown lamb in batches, without crowding, over moderately high heat, stirring occasionally, transferring as browned with a slotted spoon to bowl with onion mixture. Return lamb and onion mixture to kettle and add reserved marinade, demiglace, and jelly. Simmer mixture, covered, stirring occasionally, 45 minutes.
Peel, quarter, and core quinces. Cut quarters lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick slices. With a vegetable peeler remove zest from lemon in lengthwise strips. Diagonally cut celery ribs into 1/2-inch-thick slices.
Add quince and zest to lamb mixture and simmer, covered, stirring occasionally, until quince is tender, about 45 minutes. Stir in celery and cranberries and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until celery is tender, about 15 minutes. Season stew with salt and pepper. (Stew may be made 1 day ahead and cooled completely before being chilled, covered.)
Serve stew with couscous.

Preheat oven to 375°F. Heat oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and garlic. Sauté until onion is tender, about 4 minutes. Stir in chili powder. Add crushed tomatoes and 4 tablespoons juice from olives. Simmer sauce until flavors blend, about 6 minutes. Season with pepper and more olive juice, if desired.
Combine chicken, raisins, and olives in large bowl. Mix in 3 cups sauce. Season filling to taste with pepper.
Spread 1/2 cup sauce over bottom of 13 x 9 x 2-inch glass baking dish. Heat 1 tortilla directly over gas flame or in hot skillet until just softened, about 10 seconds per side. Place on work surface. Spread 1 tablespoon sour cream in strip in center. Top with 1/3 cup filling. Roll up tortilla. Place enchilada, seam side down, in prepared dish. Repeat, making 11 more enchiladas. Spoon remaining sauce over. Cover dish with foil.
Bake enchiladas until heated through, about 20 minutes. Uncover; top with dollops of remaining sour cream. Sprinkle with green onions and cilantro.

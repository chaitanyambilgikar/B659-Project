Squeeze juice from lemon halves into large bowl; add lemon halves. Fill bowl with water. Trim stem of 1 artichoke. Starting at base, bend leaves back and snap off where they break naturally, continuing until all tough outer leaves have been removed. Using small sharp knife, trim outside of base until smooth and no dark green areas remain. Cut artichoke in half lengthwise; cut out any choke. Add to lemon water. Repeat with remaining artichokes.
Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper. Working in batches, add chicken to pot and brown well on all sides, about 12 minutes per batch. Transfer chicken to plate. Drain artichokes. Add artichokes and pearl onions to pot and sauté until onions are golden, about 6 minutes. Add vinegar and stir until evaporated, about 3 minutes. Stir in 1/2 cup water, garlic and bay leaves. Arrange chicken atop vegetables. Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. Cover; simmer until chicken is tender, about 30 minutes. Discard bay leaves.

Make dressing:
Squeeze enough juice from limes to measure 1/4 cup. Wearing protective gloves, coarsely chop chiles. In a blender purée chiles with lime juice, oil, sugar, and salt and pepper to taste. Dressing may be made 2 days ahead and chilled in an airtight container.
Cut onion in half through stem end and thinly slice crosswise. Quarter avocados lengthwise. Peel avocados and cut lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick slices.
Arrange avocado, onion, and cilantro sprigs on a platter and season with salt and pepper. Drizzle dressing over salad.

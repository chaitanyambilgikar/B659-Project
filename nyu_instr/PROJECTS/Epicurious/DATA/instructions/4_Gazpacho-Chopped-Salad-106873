Soak bread in 1/4 cup water 1 minute, then squeeze dry, discarding soaking water.
Mash garlic to a paste with salt using a mortar and pestle (or mince and mash to a paste with a large knife). Mash garlic paste with bread, yolks, and vinegar using mortar and pestle until smooth (or blend together in a mini food processor). Add oil in a slow stream while stirring constantly (or with motor running) to form a thick sauce. Stir in black pepper.
Finely chop egg whites. Divide sauce among 4 salad plates and sprinkle with whites. Scatter tomatoes over whites and season with salt, then sprinkle with bell pepper and ham.

Preheat oven to 325°F. Grease heavy large baking sheet. Blend butter in processor until smooth. Add sugar and process until fluffy. Mix in orange concentrate, orange peel and vanilla. Add flour and process just until dough comes together, scraping down sides of work bowl occasionally.
Form 1 rounded tablespoon of dough into ball. Place on prepared sheet; flatten to 2-inch round. Repeat with remaining dough. Press 1 walnut half firmly onto each round. Bake cookies until just beginning to color, about 12 minutes. Transfer cookies to racks and cool. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Store in airtight container at room temperature.)

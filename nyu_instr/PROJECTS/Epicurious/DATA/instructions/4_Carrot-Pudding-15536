1. Preheat the oven to 300°F. In the bowl of a food processor fitted with the metal blade, or an elecric mixer fitted with the paddle beater, beat the egg yolks and sugar together until light and fluffy. Alternate additions of small amounts of butter and small amounts of flour, until all are incorporated. Add carrots and cheese. Pulse to blend. Pour into bowl and fold in baking powder.
2. Beat the eggs whites until fluffy. Stir small amount into the batter with a whisk. Fold in the remaining egg whites.
3. Pour the mixture into a buttered 3-quart soufflé dish or a 9 x 14-inch pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center of the pudding comes out clean.
4. While the pudding is baking, sauté the walnuts in the butter for about 1 minute, sprinkle with the sugar, and top the pudding. Scoop out helpings and serve.

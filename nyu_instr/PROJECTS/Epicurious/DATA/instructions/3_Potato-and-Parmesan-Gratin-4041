Preheat oven to 400°F. Butter 13 x 9 x 2-inch glass baking dish. Layer 1/3 of potatoes evenly in prepared dish. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Drizzle with 1/3 of melted butter. Top with 1/3 of Parmesan cheese. Repeat layering twice more with remaining potatoes, butter and Parmesan cheese. Pour milk evenly over.
Bake potatoes 15 minutes. Reduce temperature to 350°F. Continue to bake until potatoes are tender, top is golden brown and most of milk is absorbed, about 1 hour longer. Remove from oven; let stand 10 minutes and serve.

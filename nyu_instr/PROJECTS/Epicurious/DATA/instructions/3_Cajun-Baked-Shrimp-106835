Place shrimp in 13x9x2-inch glass baking dish. Melt butter in medium saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in Italian dressing, lemon juice, mint, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, bay leaves, pepper, and salt. Cool sauce to room temperature; mix into shrimp. Refrigerate at least 1 hour and up to 3 hours, tossing occasionally.
Preheat oven to 450°F. Bake shrimp until just opaque in center, about 15 minutes, and serve.

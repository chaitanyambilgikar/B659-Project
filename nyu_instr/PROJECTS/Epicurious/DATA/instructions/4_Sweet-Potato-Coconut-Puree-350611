Preheat oven to 450°F with rack in middle.
Prick sweet potatoes in several places with a fork, then bake on a foil-lined baking sheet, rotating potatoes halfway through baking, until very soft, 45 minutes to 1 hour. When cool enough to handle, halve sweet potatoes and scoop flesh into a bowl.
Meanwhile, bring coconut milk, brown sugar, and 1 teaspoon salt just to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally.
Stir into warm sweet potatoes, then pulse in batches in a food processor until smooth. Season with salt.

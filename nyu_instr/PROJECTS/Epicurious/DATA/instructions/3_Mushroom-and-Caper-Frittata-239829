Preheat broiler. Whisk eggs, 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese, basil, oregano, Dijon mustard, pepper, and salt in medium bowl to blend.
Heat oil in small ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms and capers. Sauté until mushrooms are brown and juices evaporate, about 6 minutes. Pour in egg mixture. Reduce heat to low. Cook without stirring until eggs are almost set, about 4 minutes. Sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoons cheese. Broil until top is brown and set, about 1 minute.
Cool frittata 5 minutes. Run spatula around edges to loosen and slide out onto plate. Cut in half and serve.

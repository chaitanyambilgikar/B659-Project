Mix together the beef, sauces, scallions, and egg in a large bowl. With damp hands, divide the mixture into 8 balls, then shape into flat patties.
Insert a piece of cheese in the center of each patty. Wrap the meat around the cheese and shape into a burger. Place on a lightly floured plate and chill for 30 minutes.
Brush the burgers with oil and cook on a cast-iron grill-pan or under a hot broiler for 5-8 minutes on each side.
Meanwhile, bake the rolls according to the manufacturer's instructions. Split them in half and top the bottoms with the cooked burgers, tomato salsa, and a lettuce leaf.
If you are cooking on a barbecue, place the burgers on a lightly oiled barbecue grill over medium heat, so they do not burn on the outside before being cooked through. Cook for 5-8 minutes on each side.

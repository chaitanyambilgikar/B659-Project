Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350°F. Butter a 9 1/2-inch deep-dish pie plate (1 1/2 quarts).
Simmer rice, milk, water, and salt, uncovered, in a 3-quart heavy saucepan over low heat, stirring frequently, until very thick, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in butter, then yolks and cheese. Transfer to a large bowl and cool to room temperature, then stir in chives and pepper.
Beat egg whites with a pinch of salt in a bowl with an electric mixer at high speed until mixture just holds soft peaks, then fold into rice mixture. Pour into pie plate and bake until golden brown and just set, 20 to 25 minutes.

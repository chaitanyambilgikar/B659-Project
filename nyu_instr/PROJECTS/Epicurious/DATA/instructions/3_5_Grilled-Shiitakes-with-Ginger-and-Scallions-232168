Prepare grill for cooking over medium-hot charcoal (moderate heat for gas). (If using a charcoal grill, open vents on bottom of grill, then light charcoal. When Charcoal turns grayish white (about 15 minutes from lighting), hold your hand 5 inches above grill rack to determine heat for charcoal as follows: Hot: When you can hold your hand there for 1 to 2 seconds; Medium-hot: 3 to 4 seconds; Low: 5 to 6 seconds. If using a gas grill, preheat burners on high, covered, 10 minutes, then, if necessary, reduce to heat specified in recipe.)
While coals are lighting, stir together Sherry, soy sauce, ginger, vinegar, sugar, and 1/2 tablespoon oil in a large bowl until sugar is dissolved.
Toss mushrooms with salt, pepper, and remaining 2 tablespoons oil, then grill on lightly oiled grill rack, covered only if using a gas grill, turning over occasionally, until lightly browned and tender, 4 to 6 minutes total. Transfer mushrooms with tongs to bowl with sauce, then add scallions and toss until combined.

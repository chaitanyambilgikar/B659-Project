Arrange a 9-inch metal cake rack or steamer basket in a 12- to 14-inch wok or a deep 12-inch skillet (with a domed lid) and add enough water to reach just below rack. Cover wok and bring water to a boil.
Score skin of fish in several places, then put on an oiled heatproof plate that will fit into wok or skillet with 1 inch clearance around plate. Stir together Sherry and salt in a small bowl, then rub mixture onto both sides of fish, leaving skin side up.
Heat vegetable oil in a small skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then sauté ginger, scallion, and chiles, stirring, until fragrant but not browned, about 30 seconds, and spoon over fish. Carefully transfer fish (on plate) to rack in wok and cover tightly, then steam until fish is just cooked through, 7 to 8 minutes. Carefully remove plate from wok and sprinkle fish with sesame oil.

Wash leek well in a bowl of cold water, then lift out and drain.
Cook celery, onion, and leek in oil in a 6-quart heavy pot over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 10 minutes.
Add remaining ingredients (vegetables may not be fully submerged) and simmer, covered, until celery and potatoes are tender, about 10 minutes.
Purée in batches in a blender until smooth (use caution when blending hot liquids), then force through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, pressing hard on solids, then discarding them. Set bowl in a larger bowl of ice and cold water. Let stand, stirring occasionally, until cold. Season with salt. Serve chilled or at room temperature.

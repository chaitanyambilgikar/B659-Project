Preheat oven to 375°F and butter a 3- to 4-quart shallow baking dish. Cut bread into 1/2-inch cubes. In 2 shallow baking pans arrange bread in one layer and toast in upper and lower thirds of oven until golden, 10 to 15 minutes.
Quarter kielbasa lengthwise and cut crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick pieces. Chop onions and celery and mince garlic. In a large heavy skillet brown kielbasa over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, and transfer with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain. To skillet add 6 tablespoons butter (do not discard any fat in skillet) and cook onions, celery, and garlic over moderately low heat, stirring, until celery is crisp-tender.
Finely chop apples. Stir apples into vegetable mixture and cook, stirring occasionally, until apple is softened. Mince parsley. In a large bowl toss together bread, kielbasa, vegetable mixture, parsley, broth, and salt and pepper to taste and transfer to baking dish. Stuffing may be made 1 day ahead and cooled completely before being chilled, covered.
Dot stuffing with remaining 2 tablespoons butter and bake, uncovered, in middle of oven until golden, about 30 minutes. (Stuffing may be baked while making gravy for roast goose)

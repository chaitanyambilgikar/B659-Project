Put a flameproof shallow baking pan on rack in upper third of oven and preheat oven to 500°F.
Pat chicken dry. Cut scallions into 2-inch-long pieces, then toss with chicken, oil, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a bowl. Roast, without crowding, in hot pan until chicken is browned in spots and just cooked through, about 25 minutes.
Transfer chicken and scallions to a serving dish, then straddle pan over 2 burners. Add wine and cook over medium heat, scraping up brown bits, 1 minute. Pour sauce over chicken.

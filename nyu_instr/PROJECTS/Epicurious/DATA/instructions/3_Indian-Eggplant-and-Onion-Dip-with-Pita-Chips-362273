Preheat oven to 475°F. Arrange pita wedges in single layer on rimmed baking sheet; brush pita lightly with 1 tablespoon olive oil.
Place eggplant, skin side down, on half of another rimmed baking sheet. Place onions and garlic on other half of sheet. Brush eggplant with 2 tablespoons oil; drizzle onions and garlic with 1 tablespoon oil. Toss vegetables; spread in thin layer.
Bake pita until crisp, about 4 minutes. Roast vegetables until browned and tender, about 30 minutes. Peel garlic. Scoop out pulp from eggplant and transfer to processor. Add onions and peeled garlic; puree until almost smooth. Transfer puree to bowl; mix in mint, cilantro, and garam masala. Season with salt and pepper; serve with pita chips.

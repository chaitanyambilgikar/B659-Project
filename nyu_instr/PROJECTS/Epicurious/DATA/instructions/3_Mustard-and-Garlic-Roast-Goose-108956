For goose: Position oven rack in bottom third of oven and preheat to 425°F. Remove excess fat and skin from main body cavity and neck cavity. Pierce goose with sharp fork, especially where fat is thickest on legs and lower breast. Sprinkle cavities and skin with salt and pepper. Tie legs together to hold shape. Place goose, breast side down, on V-shaped rack set in roasting pan. Add enough water to pan to reach depth of 1/2 inch. Roast 40 minutes. Spoon off fat from surface of liquid in pan; reserve 1/4 cup fat.
Reduce oven temperature to 350°F. Using tongs as aid, turn goose onto 1 side. Roast 30 minutes. Turn goose onto second side. Roast 30 minutes.
Whisk mustard, lemon juice, garlic, salt, pepper, and savory in small bowl to blend. Turn goose breast side up. Brush goose with mustard-garlic mixture. Roast until meat thermometer inserted into thickest part of thigh registers 175°F and juices run clear when thigh is pierced with fork, about 50 minutes. Transfer goose to platter; tent loosely with foil to keep warm. Reserve pan juices.
Meanwhile, prepare stock: Bring all ingredients to boil in large saucepan. Reduce heat to medium and simmer, uncovered, until reduced to 3 cups, occasionally skimming surface, about 1 hour. Strain stock into bowl; spoon off fat.
For gravy: Spoon off fat from top of reserved juices in roasting pan. Add 1/2 cup Port to pan. Place roasting pan atop 2 burners and boil until mixture is reduced to 1 cup, whisking occasionally, about 5 minutes. Whisk flour and reserved 1/4 cup fat in medium saucepan over medium-low heat until roux is light brown, about 5 minutes. Gradually whisk in Port mixture and 2 1/2 cups degreased stock. Simmer until gravy thickens enough to coat spoon, whisking constantly, about 3 minutes. Stir in 2 tablespoons Port. Season with salt and pepper. Carve goose and serve with gravy.

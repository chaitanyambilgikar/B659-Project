On a lightly floured surface, working with 1 half of the pastry at a time, roll out the pastry to form 16- by 12-inch rectangles and transfer each rectangle to a baking sheet. On 1 of the baking sheet draw 2 shallow crosswise lines with a blunt knife, dividing the sheet into thirds, and sprinkle the walnuts over two thirds of the pastry sheet. Cover each pastry sheet directly with the buttered bottom surface of another baking sheet to weight it. Bake the pastry sheets in a preheated 400°F.oven for 5 minutes, remove the baking sheet weights, and with a fork prick the pastry sheet all over. Return the baking sheet weights to the pastry sheets for 10 minutes more, and remove the baking sheet weights. Prick the pastry sheets again, switch the baking sheets in the oven so the pastry sheets bake evenly, and bake the pastry sheets for 7 to 10 minutes more, or until they are crisp and golden. While the pastry sheets are still warm, with a pastry wheel cut each sheet crosswise into sixteen 1-inch strips and cut the strips into sixths, making ninety-six 2-by 1-inch rectangles per sheet. The pastry rectangles may be made 1 day in advance and kept, covered with plastic wrap, on the baking sheets.
In a bowl with an electric mixer beat together the Roquefort, the cream cheese, the lemon juice, the white pepper, and salt to taste until the mixture is creamy and smooth. The filling may be made 2 days in advance and kept covered and chilled. Let the filling return to room temperature before spreading it.
Spread a thin layer of the filling on each of the rectangles without walnuts. To assemble each napoleon stack 2 Roquefort-topped layers and top them with a walnut topped layer.

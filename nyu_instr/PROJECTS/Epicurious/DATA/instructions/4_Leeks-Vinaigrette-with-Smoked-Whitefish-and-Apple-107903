Trim root end of leeks, leaving core intact. Remove any tough outer leaves. Cut each leek in half lengthwise. Bring large pot of salted water to boil. Add leeks; reduce heat to low and simmer until leeks are soft, about 12 minutes. Drain. Arrange leeks on platter. Spoon 1/2 cup vinaigrette over; let stand until leeks cool, about 1 hour. Add apple to remaining vinaigrette. Divide leeks among 8 plates. Spoon fish over leeks. Top fish with apple mixture and serve.

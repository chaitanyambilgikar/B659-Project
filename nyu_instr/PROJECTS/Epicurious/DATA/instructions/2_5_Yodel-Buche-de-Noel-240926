Place Yodels in freezer 5 minutes to firm up chocolate coating, then peel off and discard (or eat!) coating.
Using small sharp knife, cut thin slice off each end of Yodels. Cut 1 Yodel in half crosswise on angle and discard (or eat!) 1 half.
Using toothpick, attach other half of cut Yodel to whole Yodel to form "branch." Using small offset spatula or butter knife, cover Yodels with frosting, drawing spatula in long strokes down length of "log" to give appearance of bark and leaving ends of "logs" uncovered to show spiral pattern. Once branch is secured with frosting, gently remove toothpick.
Decorate as desired with leaves, chopped cherries or red candies for berries, brown candies and/or cocoa powder for earth, and shredded coconut or confectioner's sugar for snow.

1. In a medium saucepan over moderate heat, stir together 1 1/2 cups milk, 1/2 cup sugar, salt, and vanilla and bring to a boil.
2. While the liquid is heating, in a medium bowl, combine the remaining 1/2 cup milk, the remaining 1/4 cup sugar, and the cornstarch and stir to completely dissolve the cornstarch. Whisk in the egg yolks.
3. Temper the egg mixture by gradually adding about 1/3 of the hot-milk mixture, whisking constantly. Add the remaining milk mixture and whisk to combine. Return the mixture to the saucepan and continue cooking over moderate heat, whisking vigorously, until the pastry cream comes to a boil and thickens (the whisk should leave a trail when pulled through the pastry cream), 5 to 7 minutes.
4. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the butter. Transfer the pastry cream to an ice bath and stir occasionally until cool, about 30 minutes.
5. Transfer the pastry cream to a storage container and place parchment or waxed paper directly on the surface to prevent a skin from forming. Cover tightly and refrigerate until needed, up to 3 days.

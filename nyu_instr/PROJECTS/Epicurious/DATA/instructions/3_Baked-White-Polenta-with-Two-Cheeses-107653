Lightly butter 15x10x2-inch glass baking dish. Bring 12 cups water, 1 tablespoon salt, and garlic to boil in heavy large saucepan over high heat. Gradually add cornmeal, whisking until smooth. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook until cornmeal is very soft and mixture is thick and creamy, whisking often, about 12 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in half of cheddar cheese, all of mascarpone, 3 tablespoons butter, and 1/4 teaspoon white pepper. Transfer polenta to prepared dish. (Can be prepared 2 hours ahead. Cover and let stand at room temperature.)
Preheat oven to 400°F. Sprinkle remaining half of cheddar cheese over polenta. Dot with remaining 1 tablespoon butter. Bake polenta until heated through and golden on top, about 25 minutes.
* Italian cream cheese, available at Italian markets and many supermarkets.

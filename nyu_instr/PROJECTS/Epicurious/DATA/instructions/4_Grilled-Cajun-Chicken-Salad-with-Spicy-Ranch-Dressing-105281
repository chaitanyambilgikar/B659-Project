Make seasoning: Mix all ingredients in small bowl to blend.
Make salad dressing: Whisk 3/4cup buttermilk, mayonnaise, chopped green onion, chopped fresh parsley, apple cider vinegar, garlic, lemon peel, and 1 1/2 teaspoons seasoning mixture in medium bowl until well blended. Season dressing to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Store remaining seasoning at room temperature. Cover and refrigerate dressing.)
Rub remaining seasoning mixture onto chicken. Place chicken in medium bowl. Pour remaining 1 cup buttermilk over chicken, turning to coat. Refrigerate at least 30 minutes and up to 3 hours, turning occasionally.
Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Remove chicken breasts from buttermilk, shaking off excess. Grill chicken until just cooked through, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to cutting board and let rest 5 minutes.
Combine mixed greens, pecans, and raisins in large bowl. Toss with enough dressing to coat. Season salad with salt and pepper. Divide salad among 4 plates. Cut chicken on sharp diagonal into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Arrange atop salads and serve.

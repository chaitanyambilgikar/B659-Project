Make custard: In a bowl whisk together sugar and cornstarch and whisk in eggs and a pinch of salt until combined well. In a heavy saucepan heat milk and cream just to a boil. Add milk mixture to egg mixture in a slow stream, whisking, and transfer to pan. Bring custard to a boil over moderate heat, whisking constantly, and boil, whisking, 1 minute. Stir in chopped ginger and cool custard completely, stirring occasionally to prevent a skin from forming. Custard may be made 3 days ahead and chilled, covered.
Assemble trifles: Peel 1 banana and cut into 1/8-inch slices. Lightly brush slices with lemon juice to prevent discoloration. Into a 1-cup stemmed glass, spoon 1/4 cup custard and sprinkle evenly with about 2 1/2 tablespoons cookies crumbs. Drizzle 1 1/2 teaspoons liqueur over crumbs. Arrange some banana slices decoratively around inside of glass, pressing lightly to make adhere, and layer remaining banana slices on crumbs. Sprinkle about 2 1/2 tablespoons cookie crumbs evenly over bananas and drizzle with 1 1/2 teaspoons liqueur. Top crumbs with about 1/4 cup custard and some ginger pieces. Make 3 more trifles in the same manner with remaining bananas, lemon juice, custard, cookie crumbs, liqueur, and ginger pieces. Chill trifles, covered loosely with plastic wrap, at least 3 hours and up to 1 day.

Preheat oven to 400°F. Place a sheet of phyllo on a flat surface such as a cutting board; spray lightly with spray and sprinkle with 1 tbsp sugar. Cover with another sheet of phyllo. Repeat three times, finishing with spray and sugar. Using a pizza cutter or a very sharp knife, cut the phyllo into 3-inch squares. Place each square in a cup on a muffin tin, pressing in gently and fanning phyllo layers so corners don't overlap. Bake 7 to 10 minutes or until golden. Whip yogurt in a small bowl. Fold in Neufchâtel and vanilla (and liquor, if desired). Cover and refrigerate 10 minutes. After cups have cooled, remove them from muffin tin. Add 1 tbsp yogurt mixture to each cup. Top with fruit and serve. (You can also mix fruit directly into yogurt mixture.)

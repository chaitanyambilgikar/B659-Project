Preheat oven to 350° F and butter a 13x9x2-inch baking dish.
In a large non-stick skillet cook lamb or beef in 1 tablespoon oil over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until no longer pink, about 10 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and drain meat in sieve set over a large bowl, reserving any juices. Add water and bread to juices and let stand 10 minutes. Chop onions and in a skillet cook in butter and remaining tablespoon oil over moderate heat, stirring until softened.
In another large bowl combine meat, onion, and all remaining ingredients except bread mixture, lime leaves, eggs, and milk. Squeeze liquid from bread and break into small pieces, dropping into meat mixture. Toss together bread and meat and spread evenly in baking dish. Roll lime leaves into spikes and insert, evenly spaced, in several places into mixture. (Bobotie may be made up to this point one day ahead and chilled, covered. Bring bobotie to room temperature before proceeding.)
Bake bobotie in middle of oven 30 minutes. In a small bowl whisk together eggs and milk until just combined and pour over bobotie. Bake bobotie until custard is set, about 5 minutes more.
Cut bobotie into squares or wedges and serve with rice chutney.

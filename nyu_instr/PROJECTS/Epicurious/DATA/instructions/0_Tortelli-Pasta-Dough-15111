In a food processor blend all ingredients except water with a pinch salt until mixture begins to form a ball. If mixture is too dry, add enough water, a little at a time, to form a stiff dough.
On a lightly floured surface knead dough until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Pasta dough may be made 2 hours ahead and chilled, wrapped well in plastic wrap.

Toss salt and sugar with tomatoes in 2 large bowls, then let stand until very juicy, about 15 minutes.
Cook garlic in oil in a wide 8- to 10-quart heavy pot over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until golden, 3 to 5 minutes, then discard garlic. Carefully add tomato mixture (it may splatter) and basil, stirring to combine. Bring to a boil, covered, stirring occasionally, then reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, stirring more frequently toward end of cooking, until sauce is thickened and reduced by half, 2 to 3 hours.
Force sauce through food mill into a large bowl, discarding solids. Ladle sauce into 1-pint airtight containers and cool completely, uncovered, then freeze, covered.

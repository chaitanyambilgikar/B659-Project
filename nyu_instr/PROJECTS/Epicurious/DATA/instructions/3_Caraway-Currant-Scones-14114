Preheat oven to 400°F. and lightly grease a baking sheet.
Into a large bowl sift together flour, baking powder, salt, and 1 teaspoon sugar. Blend in cold butter with finger-tips until mixture resembles coarse meal. Stir in buttermilk, currants, and caraway seeds until mixture just forms dough.
On a lightly floured surface knead dough gently about 10 times and flatten into a 1 1/2-inch disk. Brush disk with melted butter and sprinkle with remaining teaspoon sugar. Cut dough into quarters with a sharp knife and arrange scones 2 inches apart on baking sheet.
Bake scones in middle of oven 18 minutes, or until pale golden, and cool on a rack. Serve scones warm or at room temperature.

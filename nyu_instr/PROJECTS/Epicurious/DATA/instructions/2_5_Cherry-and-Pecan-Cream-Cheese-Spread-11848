In a small heavy saucepan simmer cherries in water until liquid is reduced to about 1 tablespoon. Remove pan from heat and cool mixture.
In a bowl whisk together cream cheese, pecans, lime juice, thyme, zest, cherry mixture, and salt and pepper to taste until spread is combined well. Spread may be made 2 days ahead and kept chilled, covered.
Serve spread with scones or crackers.

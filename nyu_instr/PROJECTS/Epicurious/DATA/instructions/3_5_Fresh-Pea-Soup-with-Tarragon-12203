In a saucepan cook onion in butter, covered, over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes, or until tender. Add peas and broth and simmer, uncovered, 5 minutes, or until peas are tender. Stir in tarragon.
In a blender purée soup until smooth and pour through a coarse sieve back into pan. Heat soup over moderate heat until hot and remove pan from heat. Add white pepper and salt to taste and stir in all but 2 teaspoons buttermilk.
Divide soup between 2 bowls and gently spoon half of remaining buttermilk onto each serving.

For vinaigrette: Whisk all ingredients in medium bowl to blend. Season dressing to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be made 6 hours ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Rewhisk before using.)
For salad: Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Place beans, radicchio, and artichoke hearts in large bowl. Add 6 tablespoons dressing and toss to coat. Grill vegetables until crisp-tender and browned in spots, turning occasionally, about 3 minutes. Cut beans in half crosswise. Coarsely chop radicchio. Return vegetables to same bowl. Add greens and Asiago cheese. Toss with enough dressing to coat. Season salad to taste with salt and pepper. Serve warm.
*Available at Italian markets, specialty foods stores, and some supermarkets.

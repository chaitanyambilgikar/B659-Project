Preheat oven to 350°F. Place sugar in shallow pan. Add strips of bacon to pan and turn to coat completely with sugar. Transfer bacon to large broiler pan or rack set over baking sheet with rim.
Bake bacon until dark golden brown, turning once, about 8 minutes per side. Using tongs, transfer to rack and cool. (Can be prepared 4 hours ahead. Store in airtight container at room temperature.) Serve at room temperature.

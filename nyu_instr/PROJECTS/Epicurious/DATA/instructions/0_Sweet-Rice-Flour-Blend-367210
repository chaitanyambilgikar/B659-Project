Measure each ingredient by scooping it into a measuring cup (or spoon), leveling it off with a straight edge, such as the back of a knife. In a large mixing bowl, whisk all ingredients together very well until they are evenly distributed. I whisk the ingredients slowly for at least a minute or two, making sure to get to the bottom of the bowl and turning the ingredients over and over.
This recipe can easily be halved, doubled, or tripled.

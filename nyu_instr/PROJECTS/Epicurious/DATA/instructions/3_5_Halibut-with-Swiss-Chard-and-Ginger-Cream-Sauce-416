Brush fish with oil. Mix ginger, shallots and garlic in heavy small saucepan. Rub 1 teaspoon ginger mixture over each fish fillet. Add clam juice and wine to remaining ginger mixture in saucepan. Boil mixture until liquid is reduced to 1/4 cup, about 15 minutes.
Steam Swiss chard until just tender, about 30 seconds. Transfer chard to strainer and rinse with cold water. Drain.
Pat chard dry. Place 1 chard leaf on work surface. Place another leaf next to first, overlapping long sides. Place 1 fish fillet crosswise near 1 end of chard, leaving 2-inch border on short sides of fish. Season fish with salt and pepper. Fold 2 long sides of chard over fish, then roll up fish in chard, enclosing completely. Repeat with remaining chard and fish. (Can be made 8 hours ahead. Cover ginger mixture and fish separately and chill.)
Place steaming rack over boiling water in large Dutch oven. Place fish on rack. Cover; steam until cooked through, about 8 minutes. Transfer to plates.
Meanwhile, add cream to ginger mixture in saucepan. Boil until mixture thickens to sauce consistency, about 5 minutes. Spoon sauce around fish.

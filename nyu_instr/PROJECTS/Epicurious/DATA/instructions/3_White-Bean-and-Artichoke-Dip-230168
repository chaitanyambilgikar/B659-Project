Place garlic and rosemary in a food processor and finely chop. Add lemon juice and blend. Add beans and artichoke hearts and puree until smooth, stopping the machine a few times to scrape down the sides. Salt and pepper to taste. Serve with carrot and celery sticks and/or pita bread (not potato chips!). Dip will keep refrigerated for 2 to 3 days.

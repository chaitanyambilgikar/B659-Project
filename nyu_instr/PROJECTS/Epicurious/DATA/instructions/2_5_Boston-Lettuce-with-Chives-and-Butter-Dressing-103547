Sprinkle chives over lettuce in a large bowl.
Heat butter and garlic in a small heavy saucepan over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until garlic is golden and butter has a slightly nutty aroma (there will be golden-brown bits of milk solids on bottom of pan), about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and add lemon juice and salt and pepper to taste.
Toss salad with dressing and serve immediately.

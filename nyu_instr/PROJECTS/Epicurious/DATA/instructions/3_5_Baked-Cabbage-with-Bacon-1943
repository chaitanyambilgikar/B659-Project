Preheat oven to 375°F. Place bacon in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Sauté until fat begins to render and bacon begins to brown, about 12 minutes. Add cabbage and leek. Sauté until cabbage wilts, about 10 minutes. Add water; bring to boil. Cover pot, reduce heat to medium and simmer until cabbage is tender, about 15 minutes. Uncover, increase heat and boil until all liquid evaporates, stirring often, about 10 minutes. Mix in parsley and green onions. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to 9-inch glass pie dish.
Melt butter in heavy medium skillet over medium-low heat. Add breadcrumbs; stir until crisp, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle breadcrumbs over cabbage mixture. Bake until heated through, about 10 minutes.

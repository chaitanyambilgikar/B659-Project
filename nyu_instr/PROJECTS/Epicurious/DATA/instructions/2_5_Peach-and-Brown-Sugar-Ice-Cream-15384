In a saucepan combine the peaches, the granulated sugar, and 1/4 cup water and simmer the mixture, stirring occasionally, for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the peaches are soft. Purée the mixture in a food processor or blender, force the purée through a fine sieve into a bowl, and let it cool. In the pan, cleaned, cook the brown sugar with 1/4 cup water over moderately low heat, stirring, until it is dissolved. In a large bowl with an electric mixer beat the yolks and the whole egg until they are frothy, beat in the brown sugar syrup, and beat the mixture until it is thick and pale. Stir in half-and-half, scalded, pour the mixture into the pan, and cook it over moderately low heat, stirring with a wooden spoon, to 175°F. on a candy thermometer. Strain the custard through the fine sieve into another large bowl, let it cool, and stir in the peach puré, the cinnamon, the nutmeg, and the peach schnapps. Freeze the mixture in an ice-cream freezer according to the manufacturer's instructions.

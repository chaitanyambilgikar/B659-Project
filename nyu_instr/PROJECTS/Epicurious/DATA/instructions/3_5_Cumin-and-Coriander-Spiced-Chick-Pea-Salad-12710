Make the dressing: In a bowl whisk together the lemon juice, the vinegar, the garlic paste, the gingerroot, the cumin, the cayenne, and salt and pepper to taste, add the oil in a stream, whisking, and whisk the dressing until it is emulsified.
In a large bowl stir together the chick-peas, the bell peppers, the scallions, the coriander, and the dressing and chill the salad, covered, overnight.

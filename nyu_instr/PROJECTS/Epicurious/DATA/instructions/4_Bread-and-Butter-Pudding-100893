Preheat oven to 350°F.
Cut enough baguette into 1-inch cubes to measure 4 cups and in a shallow baking pan toast bread in middle of oven until crisp but not golden, about 5 minutes. Melt butter and in an 8-inch square baking pan toss with bread.
In a bowl whisk together milk, cream, eggs, sugar, vanilla, and a pinch salt and pour over bread, stirring to coat. Chill pudding, covered, 1 hour.
Bake pudding in middle of oven until just set but still trembles slightly, about 50 minutes. Serve pudding warm or at room temperature.

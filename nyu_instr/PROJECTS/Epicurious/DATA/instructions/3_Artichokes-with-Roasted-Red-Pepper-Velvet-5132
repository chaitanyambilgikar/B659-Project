Pour vinegar into small bowl. Cut stems and top 1 1/2 inches off artichokes. Peel away tough bottom outer leaves from artichokes. Dip cut surfaces of artichokes into vinegar.
Cook artichokes in large pot of boiling salted water until knife pierces base easily, turning occasionally, about 30 minutes. Remove artichokes and cool.
Gently open top of each artichoke, spreading leaves. Holding artichoke with 1 hand, gently twist out center cone of artichoke leaves with other hand. Reserve cone. Using melon baller, scoop out choke. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover; chill artichokes and cones separately.)
Place artichokes on plates. Place cones pointed side down in center of artichokes. Spoon 1 tablespoon Roasted Red Pepper Velvet atop each cone. Sprinkle with herbes de Provence. Serve, passing remaining sauce separately.

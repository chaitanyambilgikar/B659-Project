In a small bowl combine well the cumin, the cardamom, the salt, and the pepper. In a large non-stick skillet heat 1 tablespoon of the oil over moderately high heat until it is hot but not smoking and in it cook the tomato and the onion in one layer for 3 minutes. Turn the vegetables, sprinkle them with the spice mixture, and cook them for 3 minutes more, or until they are just tender. Divide the vegetables between 2 heated plates, arranging them in one layer. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the skillet, in it sauté the chops, patted dry, over moderately high heat for 5 minutes on each side for medium-rare meat, and arrange them on top of the vegetables.

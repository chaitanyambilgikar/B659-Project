Preheat oven to 250°F. Combine the first 5 ingredients in a large bowl. Set aside.
Melt butter in a small saucepan over low heat. Add garlic and gently cook to infuse butter, about 5 minutes. Strain into a small bowl, pressing to extract garlic juices; discard garlic. Stir in Worcestershire, Dijon mustard, mustard powder, salt, paprika, and pepper. Pour over mixture in bowl and gently toss to coat.
Divide mixture between 2 baking sheets and spread in an even layer. Bake, stirring every 15 minutes, until dry and toasted, about 1 hour. Sprinkle mixture with a few pinches of paprika. Toss and let cool completely on baking sheets (party mix will become crispy as it cools).
Transfer party mix to a large bowl. Add Terra Stix and toss to mix well. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 week ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.

In a small bowl whisk together the flour, the sugar, the baking powder, and the salt. In a bowl whisk together the egg, 2 tablespoons of the butter, 1/2 cup water, the raisins, and the cinnamon, add the flour mixture, and stir the batter until it is just combined. Heat a waffle iron until it is hot, brush it with the oil, and pour half the batter onto it. Cook the waffle according to the manufacturer's instructions, transfer it to a baking sheet, and keep it warm, uncovered, in a warm oven. Make another waffle with the remaining batter in the same manner. Serve the waffles with the syrup and the additional butter.

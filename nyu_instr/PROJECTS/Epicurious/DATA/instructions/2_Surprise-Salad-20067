Add the mustard and onion juice to the French dressing. While the vegetables are still warm, marinate them separately, each in 3/4 cup of the dressing. Set to chill for at least an hour.
To serve, combine the potatoes and beans with the mayonnaise, and put them in a bowl lined with lettuce. Arrange the diced beets over the beans and potatoes. Rice the egg over these and sprinkle all with the chives and dill. Serve with marinated herring, or with thin rye bread sandwiches of cream cheese and anchovy paste.

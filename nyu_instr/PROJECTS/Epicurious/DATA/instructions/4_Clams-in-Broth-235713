Cook clams: In 5- to 6-quart heavy pot over moderate heat, heat oil until hot but not smoking. Add garlic and sauté until golden brown, about three minutes. Add salt, pepper, and pepper flakes, and sauté until fragrant, about 1 minute. Increase heat to moderately high and add clams, white wine, 1 1/4 cups water, and thyme. Cover and bring to a boil. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until clams open, about 5 to 7 minutes. Discard clams that do not open after 8 minutes.
While clams cook, grill bread: Preheat grill (high heat).
Brush bread slices with olive oil on both sides and grill, flipping once, until golden brown and crispy, about 4 minutes per side. (Alternately, bread may be toasted in broiler until golden brown and crispy.) Keep warm.
When clams are cooked, stir in parsley. Serve clams with grilled bread.

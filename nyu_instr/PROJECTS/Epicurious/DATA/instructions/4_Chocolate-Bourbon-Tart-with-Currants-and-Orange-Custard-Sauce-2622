For Crust: Preheat oven to 350° F. Spray vegetable oil spray on 9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom. Combine ground cookies and butter in processor; blend until very moist crumbs form. Using plastic wrap as aid, press crumbs firmly onto sides, then bottom of prepared pan. Chill 15 minutes. Bake until set, about 8 minutes. Cool.

Bring half and half to simmer in another heavy small saucepan. Gradually whisk half and half into yolk mixture. Return mixture to same saucepan and stir over medium-low heat until custard thicken and leaves path on back of spoon when finger is drawn across, about 4 minutes (do not boil). Pour into large bowl. Add chopped bittersweet chocolate and nutmeg, whisk until melted and smooth. Mix in currants and bourbon. Chill just until cool, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes. Whip cream in medium bowl to stiff peaks. Fold cream into chocolate mixture. Transfer filling to crust. Chill until firm, at least 4 hours or overnight.

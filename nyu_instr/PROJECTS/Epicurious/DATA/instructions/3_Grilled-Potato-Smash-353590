1 Preheat the grill, or preheat the oven to 475°F.
2 Divide the potatoes, oil, salt, garlic, and cumin seeds (if using) between two large lengths of aluminum foil. Fold and scrunch up the sides of each to form two well-sealed pouches.
3 Place the pouches directly on the hot grill (or on a baking sheet in the oven) until the potatoes are soft, 40 to 45 minutes.
4 Dump the pouch contents into a large bowl and squeeze the lemons over everything.
5 Smash the potatoes with a fork, stir in the yogurt, and serve.

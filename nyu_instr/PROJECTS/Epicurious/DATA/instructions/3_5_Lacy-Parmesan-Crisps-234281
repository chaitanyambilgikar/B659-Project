Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 375°F. Line a baking sheet with nonstick liner.
Grate 1 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano using large holes of a box grater.
Arrange 6 mounds (1 rounded tablespoon each) of cheese 3 inches apart on liner, then flatten each mound lightly with a metal spatula to form a 3-inch round.
Bake until golden, 7 to 10 minutes, then transfer crisps with spatula to a rack to cool completely, about 5 minutes.
Repeat procedure with remaining cheese to make more crisps.

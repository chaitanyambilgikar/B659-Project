Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 400°F. Using vegetable peeler, remove peel (colored part only) from orange and 1/2 of lemon in strips. Place peel and sugar in processor and process until peel is finely minced and sugar is moist, about 2 minutes.
Combine 1/2 cup orange sugar, cherries, orange juice concentrate, cornstarch, cinnamon and lemon juice in large bowl. Let stand 10 minutes. Transfer cherry mixture to 9-inch-diameter cake pan with 1 3/4-inch-high sides. Bake until mixture begins to simmer and thicken, about 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine flour, baking powder and salt in medium bowl. Mix in 1/2 cup orange sugar. Gradually pour cream over dry ingredients, tossing until moist clumps form. Gently combine to form dough. Press dough out on lightly floured surface to 6- to 7-inch-diameter round. Cut into 6 wedges. Transfer wedges to top of hot cherry mixture, spacing slightly apart. Bake until biscuits are golden brown and tester inserted in center comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Serve hot.

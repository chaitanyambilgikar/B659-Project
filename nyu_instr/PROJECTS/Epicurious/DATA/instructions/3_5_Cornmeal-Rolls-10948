In the bowl of an electric mixer proof the yeast with the sugar in 1/4 cup of the water for 10 minutes, or until the mixture is foamy. Beat in the remaining 1 cup water, the cornmeal, 2 1/4 cups of the flour, and 2 teaspoons of the salt and with dough hook knead the dough for 5 minutes. Knead in enough of the remaining 1/2 cup flour so that the dough pulls away from the side of the bowl but remains sticky. Turn the dough out into a large bowl, dust it with flour, and let it rise, covered with plastic wrap, in a warm place for 1 1/2 hours, or until it is double in bulk. Punch down the dough. The dough may be made up to this point 1 day in advance and kept covered and chilled. Let the dough rise again, covered, in a warm place for 1 1/2 hours (longer if the dough was chilled), or until it is double in bulk.
Punch down the dough, knead it lightly on a lightly floured surface, and divide it into 16 pieces. Working with 1 piece of dough at a time, keeping the other pieces covered, form the dough into different shapes such as knots and wreaths. (To form wreaths, shape the dough into rings and with scissor snip the out edges at intervals.) Arrange the rolls as they are formed on a greased baking sheet. (Use a black-steel baking sheet for crustier rolls.) Let the rolls rise, uncovered, in a warm place for 30 minutes, or until they are almost double in bulk, brush them lightly with the egg, and sprinkle them with the seeds and the additional salt. Bake the rolls in the upper third of a preheated 450°F. oven for 10 to 12 minutes, or until they are golden brown. Serve the rolls warm.

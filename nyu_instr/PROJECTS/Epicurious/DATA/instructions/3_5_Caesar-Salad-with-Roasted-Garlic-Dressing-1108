Preheat oven to 300°F. Peel off papery outer skin from whole garlic, keeping heads in tact. Place in small casserole dish. Pour vermouth over. Drizzle 1 tablespoon oil over garlic. Season with pepper. Cover; bake until garlic is very soft and pastelike, about 1 1/2 hours. Cool garlic.
Increase oven temperature to 350°F. Mix 2 1/2 tablespoon oil and rosemary on baking sheet. Season with pepper. Add bread cubes and turn cubes in oil mixture to coat. Bake until lightly toasted, about 15 minutes. Cool.
Squeeze garlic to remove cloves from skins. Place in small bowl and mash with fork to form paste. Transfer paste to blender. Add fresh lemon juice, Dijon mustard, anchovy paste, Worcestershire sauce and hot pepper sauce and puree. With machine running, gradually add 1/3 cup olive oil. (Croutons and dressing can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.)
Reserve outer endive leaves for another use. Tear enough inner yellow leaves into bite-size pieces to measure 3 cups. Place in large bowl. Add romaine. Pour dressing over. Toss well. Sprinkle cheese and croutons over salad. Toss gently. Season with pepper and serve.

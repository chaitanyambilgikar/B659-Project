Trim a thin strip down length of rounded side of each celery rib to form a flat bottom, then rest celery on flat bottom. Cut away curved edges with a large knife to form flat-sided pieces of celery, discarding trimmings. Diagonally cut celery into 32 (1 1/4-inch) lengths.
Pulse half of ham in a food processor until finely chopped, then mince remaining ham with a sharp large knife. Stir together finely chopped and minced ham with remaining ingredients and pepper to taste in a bowl, then mound 1 teaspoon of filling onto each piece of celery.

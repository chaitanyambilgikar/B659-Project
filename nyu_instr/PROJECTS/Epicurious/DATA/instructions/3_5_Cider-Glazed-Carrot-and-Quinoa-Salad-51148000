Preheat oven to 450°F. Bring quinoa and 4 cups lightly salted water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer until quinoa is tender, 10-15 minutes. Add onion; cook for 1 minute longer. Drain; return quinoa mixture to saucepan, cover, and let sit for 15 minutes. Fluff with a fork and transfer to a large bowl; let cool.
Meanwhile, lightly coat a large rimmed baking sheet with oil. Whisk cider and honey in a large bowl to blend; season with salt and pepper. Add carrots and toss to coat. Transfer to prepared baking sheet and roast until tender, 15-20 minutes. Let cool.
Whisk vinegar, lemon zest, and lemon juice in a small bowl. Gradually add 1/4 cup oil, whisking until dressing is blended. Season vinaigrette with salt and pepper. DO AHEAD: Quinoa, carrots, and vinaigrette can be made 6 hours ahead. Cover and chill separately.
Add beets, dill, carrots, and half of vinaigrette to quinoa mixture and toss to coat. Add lettuce and remaining vinaigrette and toss to combine.

Preheat oven to 350°F. Combine apple juice, sugar, and butter in a bowl. Add apples and cornstarch. Place one piecrust in a 9" pie pan and fill with mixture. Slice the second piecrust into eight 1/2-inch-thick strips and drape over filled pie shell in a crisscross pattern; pinch edges to fasten to bottom crust. Bake 55 minutes or until golden brown. Sprinkle top with cinnamon.

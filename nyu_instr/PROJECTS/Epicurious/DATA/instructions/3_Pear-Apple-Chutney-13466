Halve and core pears and apples. Cut 2 pear halves and 2 apple halves into 1/4-inch-thick slices and chop remaining pears and apples.
In a saucepan combine sliced and chopped pears and apples with remaining ingredients and bring to a simmer, stirring gently. Simmer chutney, covered, stirring occasionally, until fruit is just tender, 10 to 15 minutes, and cool. Chutney may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered. Serve chutney chilled or at room temperature.

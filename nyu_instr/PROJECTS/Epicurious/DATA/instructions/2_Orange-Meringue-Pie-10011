Make shell: In a large bowl with a pastry blender or in a food processor blend or pulse together flour and shortening until mixture resembles meal. In a small bowl stir together egg yolk, vinegar, and ice water. Gradually add yolk mixture to flour mixture, stirring with a fork until mixture forms a dough. Form dough into a flattened disk and chill, wrapped in plastic wrap, 1 hour or overnight.
Preheat oven to 425°F.
Roll dough into a 12-inch round on a lightly floured surface and fit into a 10-inch (1 1/2-quart) glass pie plate, crimping edge decoratively. Prick shell in several places with a fork and chill 30 minutes.
Line shell with foil and fill with rice. Bake shell in middle of oven 15 minutes. Remove foil and rice carefully and bake shell 12 to 15 minutes more, or until pale golden. Cool shell in pie plate on a rack.
Make filling: Into a 4-quart saucepan sift together sugar, cornstarch, and salt. Gradually whisk in zest, 1 1/2 cups orange juice, and lemon juice. Cook mixture over moderate heat, whisking constantly, until sugar is dissolved. Remove pan from heat and add butter, whisking constantly until melted. Add remaining 2 1/4 cups orange juice and eggs and simmer, stirring constantly, 2 minutes, or until smooth and thickened.
Strain filling through a sieve into a bowl and pour into shell. Cool pie completely.
Make meringue: Preheat oven to 350°F.
In a large bowl with an electric mixer beat egg whites on low speed until frothy. Add cream of tartar and increase speed, beating until whites hold soft peaks. Gradually beat in sugar and vanilla and beat on high speed until meringue holds stiff and glossy peaks.
Spread meringue on top of cooled filling, covering filling completely, and bake pie in middle of oven 15 minutes, or until meringue is golden. Chill pie 3 hours, or until set.

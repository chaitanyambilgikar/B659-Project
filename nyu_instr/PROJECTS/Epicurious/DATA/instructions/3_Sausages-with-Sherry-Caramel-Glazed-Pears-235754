Bring sugar and 1/4 cup water to a boil in a 10-inch heavy skillet, stirring until sugar is dissolved and washing down any sugar crystals on side of skillet with a pastry brush dipped in cold water. Boil syrup, without stirring, gently swirling skillet, until mixture is a deep golden caramel.
Carefully stir in vinegar (mixture will steam vigorously and caramel will harden). Remove from heat and stir until caramel is dissolved, about 30 seconds. Transfer to a heatproof cup and reserve skillet (do not clean skillet).
Peel pears, quarter lengthwise, and core. Toss with 1 teaspoon lemon juice.
Add 1/4 cup water, butter, and shallots to reserved skillet, then cook, uncovered, over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until liquid is evaporated and shallots begin to brown, about 5 minutes.
Add pears and cook, turning occasionally, until golden brown but not soft, about 6 minutes.
Stir in caramel, salt, and pepper, then cook 1 minute. Remove from heat and stir in remaining 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice.
While pears and shallots are sautéing, cook sausages in oil and remaining 1/4 cup water in a 12-inch heavy skillet, covered, over moderate heat, 5 minutes.
Remove lid from skillet and cook sausages, turning occasionally, until liquid is evaporated and sausages are browned and cooked through, about 6 to 12 minutes more. Serve sausages with shallots and pears.

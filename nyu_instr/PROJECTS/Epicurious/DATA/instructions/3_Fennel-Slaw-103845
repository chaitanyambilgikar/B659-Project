Whisk together all ingredients except fennel.
Trim fennel stalks flush with bulb, discarding stalks, and remove any discolored outer layers. Halve fennel through root end and discard core. Thinly slice fennel with a mandoline or other manual slicer.
Toss fennel with enough dressing to coat, then season with salt and pepper.

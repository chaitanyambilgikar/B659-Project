Preheat oven to 400°F. Butter twelve 1/3-cup muffin cups. Combine flour, toasted coconut, sugar, almonds, baking powder, orange peel, baking soda and salt in large bowl. Whisk coconut milk, eggs, butter and vanilla extract in medium bowl to blend. Add egg mixture to flour mixture and stir until combined.
Divide batter among prepared muffin cups. Bake until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 15 minutes. Turn out onto rack and cool slightly. (Can be prepared 1 week ahead. Cool completely. Enclose muffins in resealable plastic bags and freeze. Thaw before serving.)

Combine first 4 ingredients in medium bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Form mixture into 1 1/2-inch-diameter meatballs. Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add meatballs in batches (do not crowd) and cook until brown on all sides, about 8 minutes.
Meanwhile, warm Marinara Sauce in heavy small saucepan over low heat. Pour sauce over spaghetti. Top with meatballs. Serve immediately, passing additional Parmesan separately.

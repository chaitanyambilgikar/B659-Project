Preheat oven to 400°F. To make rub, grind the first three ingredients in a coffee grinder, in a food processor or with a mortar and pestle; mix with sugar and salt. Thoroughly rub mix onto each fillet; set aside 5 minutes. Add oil to a large, oven-safe skillet and heat over medium-high. Sear fillets 1 minute on each side or until browned. Transfer to oven and cook 5 to 10 minutes, depending on doneness.

Preheat oven to 400°F. Butter 11x7-inch glass baking dish. Cook penne pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite. Drain. Arrange a third of pasta in prepared dish. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Arrange half of Fontina cheese slices over pasta. Repeat layering. Top with remaining pasta. Sprinkle pasta with salt and pepper. Dot with butter.
Bake pasta uncovered until Fontina melts, about 10 minutes. Toss pasta. Bake 2 minutes longer. Season pasta to taste with salt and pepper. Sprinkle chopped oregano over pasta and serve immediately.

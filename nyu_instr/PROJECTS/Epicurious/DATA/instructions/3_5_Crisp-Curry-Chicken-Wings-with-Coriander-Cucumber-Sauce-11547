Cut off the wing tips, reserving them for another use such as stock if desired, and halve the wings at the joint. In a bowl stir together the curry powder, 2 tablespoons of the chutney, the lemon juice, the salt, and the cayenne, add the wings, and toss them to coat them well. Let the wings marinate, covered and chilled for at least 4 hours or overnight. In a small bowl stir together the remaining 2 tablespoons chutney and the soy sauce. Arrange the wings, marinade discarded, skin side up, on the oil rack of a broiler pan and bake them in a preheated 475°F. oven for 25 minutes. Brush the wings with the soy-sauce mixture and broil them under a preheated broiler about 4 inches from the heat for 1 to 2 minutes, or until they are crisp.
Make the sauce: In a small bowl stir together the yogurt, the cucumber, the minced coriander, the juice, and salt to taste.
Transfer the wings to a platter, garnish them with the coriander sprigs, and serve them warm or at room temperature with the sauce.

Combine 1 quart cold water and lemon juice in a large bowl. Working with 1 artichoke at a time, bend back outer leaves until they snap off close to base and discard several more layers of leaves in same manner until exposed leaves are pale green at top and pale yellow at base. Cut off leaves flush with top of base and cut a thin slice from end of stem to expose a fresh cross section. Trim dark green fibrous parts from base and stem of artichoke, being careful not to break off stem.
Rub artichoke all over with lemon halves. Quarter lengthwise and remove fuzzy center and any purple leaves. Put in bowl of lemon water.
Have ready a bowl of ice and cold water. Drain artichokes and cook in a large pot of boiling salted water until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain and transfer to ice water to cool. Drain well.

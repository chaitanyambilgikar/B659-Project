In a small saucepan combine the potato, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces, with enough cold water to cover it by 1 inch and simmer it, covered, for 10 to 15 minutes, or until it is very tender. While the potato is cooking, in a small skillet cook the artichoke hearts in the butter with salt and pepper to taste over moderate heat, stirring, until they are very tender. Drain the potato, return it to the pan, and cook it covered, over moderate heat, shaking the pan, for 30 seconds, or until excess liquid is evaporated. Force the artichoke mixture and the potato through a food mill fitted with a medium disk into a bowl, discarding the solids, and season the purée with salt and pepper.

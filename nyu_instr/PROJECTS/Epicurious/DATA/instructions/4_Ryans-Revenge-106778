1. Combine the beer, chili powder, cumin, paprika, bouillon granules, and oregano in a large, heavy pot. Add 1 1/4 cups of water. Bring the mixture to a boil, then remove from the heat.
2. Place 2 tablespoons of oil in a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Brown the meat in small batches, seasoning with salt and pepper. Transfer the meat to the pot with a slotted spoon. Sauté the onions, peppers and garlic over low heat, adding more oil if necessary, until softened, about 8 minutes, then remove to the pot.
3. Stir in tomato sauce, coriander, chili sauce, mole poblano, and sugar. Bring the mixture to a boil; reduce heat and simmer, covered, for 2 hours.
4. Just before serving, stir in lime juice. Serve with grated cheese, if desired.

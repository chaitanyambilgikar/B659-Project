For beef: Preheat oven to 425°F.
Toast peppercorns, cumin, and coriander , then cool completely. Grind spices with red pepper flakes in an electric coffee/spice grinder or with a mortar and pestle. Stir in kosher salt.
Pat beef dry and sprinkle with spices on all sides, pressing to adhere. Heat oil in a large flameproof roasting pan set across 2 burners over high heat until just smoking, then brown beef on all sides, about 2 minutes.
Roast in middle of oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted diagonally 2 inches into center registers 120°F, about 25 minutes. Let beef stand in pan 25 minutes. Beef will continue to cook as it stands, reaching 130°F (medium-rare).
Make salad and slice beef: Whisk together oil, lemon juice, shallot, and salt in a bowl, then add pepper to taste.
Untie beef if necessary, then slice. Toss mizuna with dressing and serve beef topped with salad.

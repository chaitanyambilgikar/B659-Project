Preheat oven to 400°F. Line a 15x11" roasting pan with foil, if desired. Stuff herbs into chicken cavity; tie legs loosely together. Tuck wing tips under.
Place salt and egg whites in a large bowl. Use your hands to blend well, kneading to soften slightly, about 4 minutes. Pack 1/3 of salt mixture onto bottom of pan. Place chicken on top. Pack remaining salt mixture over and around chicken to completely enclose.
Roast until a thermometer registers 165°F when inserted through the salt crust into thickest part of thigh, about 70 minutes. Let rest for 10 minutes. Crack salt with the back of a knife or wooden spoon. Remove salt and skin from chicken; transfer meat to a work surface. Carve and serve.

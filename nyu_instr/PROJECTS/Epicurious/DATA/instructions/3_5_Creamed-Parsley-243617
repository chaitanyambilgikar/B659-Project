Blanch parsley in a large pot of boiling salted water (2 tablespoons salt for 4 quarts water) 20 seconds. Transfer parsley to an ice bath to stop cooking. Spin dry and blot with paper towels.
Cook shallot in butter with garlic and ginger in a heavy medium skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until softened, 3 to 4 minutes.
Add cream, crème fraîche, and orange zest to skillet and simmer, stirring occasionally, 4 minutes. Add mint and remove from heat. Let stand, uncovered, 2 minutes. Discard garlic, ginger, zest, and mint.
Return sauce to a simmer and add parsley, separating gently with a fork. Season with salt and pepper and simmer, tossing gently, until just heated through, about 2 minutes.

Using vegetable peeler, remove strip of peel in thin band around center of each potato. Place potatoes in large saucepan; cover with cold water. Sprinkle generously with salt and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium and cook just until potatoes are tender, about 12 minutes. Drain well. Return potatoes to saucepan. Add butter to pan; stir over medium heat until butter melts and coats potatoes. Sprinkle with chives, salt, and pepper. Transfer potatoes to bowl and serve.

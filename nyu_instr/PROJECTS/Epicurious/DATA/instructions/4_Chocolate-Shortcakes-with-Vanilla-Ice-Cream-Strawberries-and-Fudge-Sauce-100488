Preheat oven to 400°F. Line large baking sheet with parchment paper. Whisk cream, chocolate syrup, vanilla and dissolved espresso powder in small bowl.
Blend flour, 1/2 cup sugar, cocoa, baking powder and salt in processor. Add 1/4 cup chilled butter; process until mixture resembles fine meal. Add chocolate-cream mixture and blend, using on/off turns, until moist clumps form.
Turn dough out onto work surface. Gather dough into ball; divide into 6 equal pieces. Using lightly floured hands, form each piece into 2-inch-high, 2-inch-diameter mound. Place on prepared baking sheet, spacing shortcakes 3 inches apart (shortcakes will spread). Brush tops of shortcakes with melted butter. Sprinkle each with 1 teaspoon sugar.
Bake shortcakes until tester inserted into center comes out with some moist crumbs attached, about 15 minutes. Cool on sheet. (Can be made 6 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature. Rewarm in 350°F oven about 5 minutes before continuing.)
Cut shortcakes horizontally in half. Whisk banana liqueur into warm Fudge Sauce. Spoon scant 1/3 cup warm sauce onto each of 6 plates. Place bottoms of shortcakes onto sauce. Top with scoop of ice cream. Spoon strawberries over. Add shortcake tops and serve.

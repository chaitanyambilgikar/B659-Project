Preheat oven to 350°F. Lightly butter 2 heavy large baking sheets. Soak raisins in enough hot water to cover until soft, about 15 minutes. Drain; set aside.
Mix flour, baking soda and slat in large bowl. Using electric mixer, beat butter and both sugars in another large bowl until light and fluffy. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Mix in vanilla. Add dry ingredients; mix just until blended.Stir in nuts and raisins.
Working in batches and using palms of hands, roll dough into 3/4-inch balls. Arrange on baking sheets, spacing evenly. Bake until cookies are golden brown, about 12 minutes. Transfer baking sheets to racks; cool 5 minutes. Transfer cookies to racks; cool completely. (Can be prepared 2 days ahead. Store cookies in airtight container at room temperature.)

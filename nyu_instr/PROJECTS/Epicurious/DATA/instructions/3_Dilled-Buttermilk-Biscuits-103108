Preheat oven to 400°F. Whisk buttermilk, egg and dill in small bowl to blend. Whisk flour and next 3 ingredients in large bowl to blend. Add shortening and butter to dry ingredients; cut in with fork until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add buttermilk mixture and stir just until moist dough forms.
Using floured hands, gently knead dough on well-floured work surface until dough just holds together. Pat out dough to 9x6-inch rectangle (about 3/4 inch thick). Cut dough into six 3-inch squares. Transfer squares to ungreased baking sheet, spacing 2 1/2 inches apart. (Can be prepared 8 hours ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
Bake biscuits until puffed and golden brown, about 12 minutes.

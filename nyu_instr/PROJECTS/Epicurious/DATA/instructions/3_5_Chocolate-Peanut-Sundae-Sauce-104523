Bring 1 cup water to boil in medium saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in sugar and cocoa powder. Whisk constantly until bubbles form around edge of pan. Simmer until sauce thickens slightly, whisking occasionally, about 3 minutes. Reduce heat to low and whisk in peanut butter. Simmer until sauce thickens and is smooth, whisking occasionally, about 3 minutes longer. Remove from heat; add vanilla. Cool slightly. (Can be made 1 week ahead. Cool completely, then cover and refrigerate. Transfer to small glass bowl. Reheat in bowl over saucepan of simmering water or in microwave.)

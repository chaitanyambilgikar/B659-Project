Cook potatoes in large saucepan of boiling salted water until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain. Return to saucepan; mash.
Combine bread cubes, green onions, 1/2 cup milk, and tarama in processor. Process until smooth paste forms. Transfer mixture to bowl. Add 1 whole egg and 1 cup mashed potatoes (reserve any remaining potato for another use); stir to blend well. Cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours and up to 1 day.
Lightly beat egg whites and remaining 2 tablespoons milk in medium bowl to blend. Place breadcrumbs on plate. Form 2 tablespoons tarama mixture into ball; press to flatten slightly. Dip into egg-white mixture, then coat on both sides with breadcrumbs. Repeat with remaining tarama mixture.
Pour equal amounts olive oil and safflower oil into heavy large saucepan to reach depth of 1 inch. Attach deep-fry thermometer to side of saucepan and heat oil over medium-high heat to 350°F. Working in batches, add tarama croquettes to skillet and fry until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Transfer croquettes to platter. Serve hot, passing lemon wedges separately.

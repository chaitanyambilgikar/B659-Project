Toss zucchini with 3/4 teaspoon salt in a colander set over a bowl and let drain 20 minutes. Squeeze handfuls of zucchini in a kitchen towel to remove excess moisture.
Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium heat, then cook bread crumbs, zest, thyme, and 1/8 teaspoon salt, stirring, until crumbs are golden, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and wipe out skillet, then cook garlic in remaining 3 tablespoons butter over medium-high heat, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add zucchini and sauté until softened slightly, 2 to 3 minutes. Serve zucchini topped with bread crumbs.

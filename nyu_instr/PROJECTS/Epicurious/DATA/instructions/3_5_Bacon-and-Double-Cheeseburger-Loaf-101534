Preheat the oven to 350°F. In a medium skillet, cook the bacon over medium heat until limp and some of the fat is rendered, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the bacon from the skillet and reserve it.
In a large mixing bowl, use your hands to gently but thoroughly mix together the meat, bread crumbs, 1/2 cup of the cheese, onion, mayonnaise, relish, mustard, salt, pepper, and egg. Pat the mixture into a shallow 2-quart baking pan. Spread the top of the loaf with ketchup, then lay the bacon strips over the ketchup. Bake until the loaf is firm and the bacon is crisp, 45 to 50 minutes, sprinkling the top the loaf with the remaining 1/2 cheese to melt during the last 5 to 10 minutes of baking. Let the meatloaf stand in the baking dish for 10 minutes, then cut into squares to serve.

Cut the dates into small pieces and combine them with the sugar and honey. Add the water and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer gently. Melt the butter in a heavy skillet and add the Cream of Rice. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the Cream of Rice is a golden brown. Add the date mixture and the spices and mix thoroughly. Cook, stirring constantly, until thickened. This will take about 5 minutes. Stir in the coconut and remove from the stove.
Spoon into a large bowl or individual dishes and serve warm or cool with whipped cream.

Heat oil in medium saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic, cumin, and paprika and sauté until garlic is golden, about 2 minutes. Add tomatoes, cilantro, and parsley. Cook until tomatoes are juicy, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Rewarm over medium heat, stirring frequently.)

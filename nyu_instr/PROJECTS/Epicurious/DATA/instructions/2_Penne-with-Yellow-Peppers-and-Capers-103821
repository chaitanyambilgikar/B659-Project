Heat oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderate heat until hot but not smoking, then add bell peppers, onion, garlic, and anchovy. Lower heat to moderately low and cook, covered, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are very tender and lightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir in capers and vinegar.
Meanwhile, cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water until al dente. Drain, reserving 1/2 cup cooking water. Add pasta to pepper mixture and toss, adding enough cooking water for sauce to coat pasta. Season with salt and pepper and toss with basil.

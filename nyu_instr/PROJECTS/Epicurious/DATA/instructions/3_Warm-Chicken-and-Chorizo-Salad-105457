Heat a nonstick skillet or stove-top grill pan, add the chorizo slices or chunks, and sauté gently on all sides until the juices run and the edges are slightly crisp. Set aside.
Mix the vinaigrette ingredients together in a small bowl or pitcher. Use some of the mixture to brush the zucchini halves, then add them to the still-hot pan and cook for 5 minutes on each side or until hot and golden.
Put the chicken into a large salad bowl and add the lettuce leaves and olives. Drizzle over the remaining vinaigrette, then add the chorizo and its juices, and the cilantro or parsley. Toss well, then serve immediately with garlic bread, toasted ciabatta, or warmed focaccia.

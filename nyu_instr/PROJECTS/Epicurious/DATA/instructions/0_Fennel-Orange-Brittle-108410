Line a large baking sheet with a sheet of foil, then lightly oil foil. Cook sugar in a dry 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderate heat, undisturbed, until it begins to melt. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, until sugar is melted into a deep golden caramel. Immediately remove from heat and stir in fennel seeds and zest, then quickly pour onto baking sheet, spreading with back of spoon before syrup hardens.
Cool on baking sheet 5 minutes, then break into pieces and pulse in a food processor until finely ground.

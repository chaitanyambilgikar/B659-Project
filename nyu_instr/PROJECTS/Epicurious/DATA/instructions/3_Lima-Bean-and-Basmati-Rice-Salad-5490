Mix yogurt and 1 1/2 teaspoons garlic in small bowl. Cover and chill 1 hour. Heat 1 teaspoon oil in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat. Add rice; stir until coated with oil, about 2 minutes. Add curry powder, turmeric and 1 1/2 teaspoons garlic and stir 1 minute. Add 2 cups water and salt and bring to boil. Add lima beans. Reduce heat to medium-low; cover and simmer until rice is tender and water is absorbed, about 15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Cool. Stir in remaining olive oil.
Transfer rice mixture to large bowl. Spoon Tomato-Onion Topping over. Top with 1/4 cup yogurt mixture. Serve, passing remaining yogurt mixture separately.

For chimichurri sauce: Whisk all ingredients and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt in medium bowl. Let stand at room temperature 2 hours.
For beef: Whisk all ingredients except beef in large bowl; whisk in 1 tablespoon salt. Add beef; toss to coat. Cover and chill 1 hour, turning occasionally.
Prepare barbecue (high heat). Thread beef with some marinade still clinging onto 8 skewers. Grill skewers until beef is charred on all sides and cooked to desired doneness, about 5 minutes for medium-rare.
Place 1 skewer on each plate. Pass chimichurri sauce alongside.

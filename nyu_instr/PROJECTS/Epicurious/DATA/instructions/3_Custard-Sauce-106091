Bring milk with zest to a simmer in a small heavy saucepan over moderate heat. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, 20 minutes.
Whisk together yolks, sugar, and a pinch of salt. Whisk in milk with zest, then transfer mixture to cleaned saucepan.
Cook over moderate heat, stirring constantly, until custard thickens enough to coat back of a wooden spoon (170°F on an instant-read thermometer). Immediately pour through a fine sieve into a bowl. Discard zest and stir in vanilla. Cool to room temperature, stirring occasionally. Chill custard, its surface covered with wax paper (to prevent a skin from forming), until cold, at least 1 hour.

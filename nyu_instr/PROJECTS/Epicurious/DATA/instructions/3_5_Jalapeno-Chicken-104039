Preheat oven to 350°F. Starting at neck end, carefully run fingers between skin and breast meat of chicken, loosening skin. Place chili rounds, spaced slightly apart, on breast meat under skin. Toss 4 lemon wedges, onion, 1/2 tablespoon oil and soy sauce in small bowl to coat. Stuff lemon mixture into main cavity of chicken. Rub outside of chicken with remaining 2 tablespoons oil; sprinkle with salt. Place chicken on rack in roasting pan. Roast chicken until golden brown and juices run clear when thigh is pierced with knife, about 1 1/2 hours. Transfer chicken to platter. Serve with remaining lemon wedges.

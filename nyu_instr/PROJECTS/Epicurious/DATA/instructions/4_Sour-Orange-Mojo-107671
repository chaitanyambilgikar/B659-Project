In a mortar mash the raw garlic, Scotch bonnet, salt, and cumin until fairly smooth. Scrape this into a bowl and set aside.
In a saucepan over medium heat, warm the oil until just hot and pour it over the garlic-chili mix, stirring the ingredients. Remove the pan from the heat and let it stand for 10 minutes.
Whisk in the sour orange juice and the vinegar. Season with pepper. Refrigerated, this will keep up to 3 months.

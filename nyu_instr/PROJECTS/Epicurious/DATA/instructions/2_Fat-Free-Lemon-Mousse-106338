Pour 2 tablespoons water into small saucepan; sprinkle gelatin over. Let stand until gelatin softens, about 10 minutes. Stir over very low heat just until gelatin dissolves, about 1 minute. Stir in fat-free half and half, 2 tablespoons sugar, and grated lemon peel. Stir over very low heat until sugar dissolves, about 2 minutes (do not boil). Transfer gelatin mixture to large bowl. Set bowl in another large bowl filled halfway with ice water; stir until mixture is cool, about 5 minutes.
Using electric mixer, beat egg whites with cream of tartar in medium bowl until soft peaks form. Gradually add 2 tablespoons sugar and beat until stiff but not dry. Fold egg whites into gelatin mixture. Divide mousse among 4 wineglasses. Chill until mousse is softly set, at least 4 hours and up to 1 day. Serve mousse cold.

In a small saucepan, bring 1/2 cup tomato juice to a boil. Lower heat and let simmer until tomato juice is reduced to 1/4 cup. Whisk in 1 tablespoon butter, off the heat, until creamy. Set aside.
In a heavy medium pot, bring 2 1/2 cups water and 1 cup tomato juice to a boil.
Lower heat to medium. Slowly add cornmeal, letting it slip through your fingers. Stir constantly with a wooden spoon, making sure that no lumps form.
Stir until thick, but still runny and creamy, about 8 to 10 minutes. Cut 3 tablespoons butter into small pieces. Add bit by bit, stirring constantly. Season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Spoon immediately into 4 flat soup plates and drizzle warm reduced tomato juice over the top. Serve immediately.

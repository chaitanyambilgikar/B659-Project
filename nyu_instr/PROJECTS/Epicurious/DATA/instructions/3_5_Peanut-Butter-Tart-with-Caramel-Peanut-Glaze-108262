For crust: Blend first 3 ingredients in processor to combine. Add butter; using on/off turns, cut in until coarse meal forms. Add egg yolk, cream, and vanilla extract; process until moist clumps form. Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk. Wrap in plastic and chill at least 1 hour and up to 1 day.
Preheat oven to 350°F. Roll out dough on lightly floured surface to 11-inch round. Transfer dough to 9-inch fluted tart pan with removable bottom. Fold in overhang to form double-thick sides. Pierce dough all over with fork; freeze 15 minutes.
Bake crust until golden brown, about 25 minutes. Transfer to rack and cool completely. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.)
For filling: Stir 1/3 cup brown sugar, 3 tablespoons cream, and butter in medium saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Cool completely.
Using electric mixer, beat cream cheese, peanut butter, and vanilla in medium bowl until smooth. Stir in brown sugar mixture.
Using electric mixer, beat remaining 2 tablespoons brown sugar and 1/4 cup cream in another medium bowl until peaks form. Fold into peanut butter mixture. Transfer to crust; smooth top with spatula. Chill until set, about 3 hours.
For caramel-peanut glaze: Stir brown sugar, butter, 1/4 cup water, 2 tablespoons cream, and corn syrup in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat to high and boil without stirring until candy thermometer registers 238°F, about 7 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in remaining 2 tablespoons cream and peanuts. Cool just to lukewarm, about 15 minutes.
Pour glaze atop filling, smoothing with spatula. Chill tart until set, about 30 minutes. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Keep chilled.) Cut into wedges and serve.

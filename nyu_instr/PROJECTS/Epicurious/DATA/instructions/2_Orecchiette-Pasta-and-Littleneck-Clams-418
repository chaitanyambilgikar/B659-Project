Cook orecchiette in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite. Drain. Return to pot. Mix in oil, 2 tablespoons parsley and oregano.
Meanwhile, combine clams, wine, shallot, garlic and thyme in large Dutch oven. Cover; boil until clams open, about 8 minutes (discard any that do not open).
Add pasta to clams and stir to blend. Cook over medium-high heat until pasta absorbs some clam juices, about 3 minutes. Season with pepper. Transfer to large bowl. Sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoons parsley and serve.

Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add 2 1/2 cups chopped red onions, 1 ounce finely chopped smoked ham, 3 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme and bay leaves and sauté until onions are tender and golden, about 8 minutes. Add chicken pieces, 3 cups baby lima beans, Italian-style tomatoes with their juices and minced garlic cloves and bring mixture to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover and simmer until chicken pieces are cooked through and lima beans are tender, about 25 minutes. Discard bay leaves. Season mixture to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer paella to large serving bowl. Sprinkle with remaining 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme and serve.

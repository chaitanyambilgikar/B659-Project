Position the racks in the lower and upper third of the oven and preheat the oven to 450°F. Line two baking sheets with Silpats or parchment paper.
Trim the ends of the squash and cut off the neck portions from the bulbs. Place the 4 pieces of squash cut side down on a board, and cut into 1/4-inch slices. Toss with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper.
Lay the slices on the prepared baking sheets and roast for about 20 minutes, until golden brown and soft. Rotate the baking sheets halfway through cooking.
Meanwhile, prepare the vinaigrette and cook the pancetta.
To Make the Vinaigrette: Combine the remaining 1/2 cup olive oil, the vinegar, nibs, and shallot in a small bowl. Season with salt and pepper.
In a large skillet, cook the pancetta over medium heat until crisp, 10 to 15 minutes, turning to brown evenly. Drain on paper towels. When it is cool, chop or crumble into small pieces.
Place the squash in a large bowl, add about 1/4 cup of the vinaigrette, and toss gently to coat. Arrange the slices on individual plates or a large platter. Drizzle with remaining vinaigrette and top with the pancetta. Serve warm.

1. Preheat oven to 325°F.
2. Whisk together the eggs, milk, salt, and pepper; set aside.
3. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the leek and onion with a pinch of salt. Cook until tender, about 5 minutes.
4. Add the carrot; cook for 1 minute more. Remove from heat.
5. Grease a 6-cup muffin tin. Divide the cheese among the cups, then the vegetables.
6. Pour in the egg mixture until each cup is three-quarters full. Add a few potato chips to each.
7. Bake until cooked through, 12 to 15 minutes. Run a knife around the edges to loosen; serve.

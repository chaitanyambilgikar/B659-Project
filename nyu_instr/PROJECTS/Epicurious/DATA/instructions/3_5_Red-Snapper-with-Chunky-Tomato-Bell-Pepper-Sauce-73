Preheat oven to 400°F. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in heavy medium skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and sauté 1 minute. Add wine and bring to boil. Add marinara sauce, roasted peppers and half of basil and cook until reduced to thick sauce, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. (Sauce can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Reheat before continuing.)
Pour remaining 1 tablespoon oil into small baking dish. Add fish; turn to coat. Season with salt and pepper. Spoon sauce over fish. Bake just until cooked through, about 20 minutes. Sprinkle remaining basil over and serve.

Place the beans in a nonreactive pan. Cover with the 3 quarts of water, add the bay leaves, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer the beans for 2 1/2 to 3 hours, stirring frequently and adding more water if necessary to keep them well covered.
Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a sauté pan or skillet. Sauté the bell peppers, shallots, and onions over medium heat until the onions are translucent, about 15 minutes.
Add the garlic, cumin, dried and fresh oregano, and sauté for an additional 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool slightly. Transfer to a blender and purée until smooth.
When the beans are almost tender, add the puréed mixture, sugar, and salt to the beans and cook until just tender, 20 to 30 minutes. Adjust the seasonings, garnish with the red onion and sour cream, and serve.

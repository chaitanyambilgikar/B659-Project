Make tapenade: Blend all tapenade ingredients in a food processor until finely chopped but not puréed, 2 to 3 seconds.
Make tartines: Lightly toast bread and rub 1 side of each slice with garlic. Spread each with 1 tablespoon cheese and about 2 1/2 tablespoons tapenade. Cut each tartine into 8 wedges.

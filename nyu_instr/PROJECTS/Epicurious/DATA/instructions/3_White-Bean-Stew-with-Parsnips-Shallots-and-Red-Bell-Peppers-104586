Preheat oven to 375°F. Combine parsnips and shallots in medium roasting pan. Drizzle with oil. Sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon thyme, sugar, salt and pepper; toss to coat. Dot with butter. Roast until vegetables are tender and deep golden brown, stirring occasionally, about 1 hour 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine 8 cups water, beans, 1 teaspoon salt, bay leaf and remaining 1 teaspoon thyme in heavy large pot. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover and simmer until beans are almost tender, stirring occasionally, about 1 hour 15 minutes (some liquid will remain). Mix vegetables into beans, cover and cook until beans are tender, thinning with more water if needed, about 15 minutes. Discard bay leaf. Meanwhile, char peppers over gas flame or in broiler until blackened. Enclose in paper bag 10 minutes. Peel, seed and coarsely chop peppers; stir into beans. Season stew with salt and pepper.

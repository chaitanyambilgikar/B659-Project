Preheat a waffle iron until hot.
Whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt, then mix in rice with your fingertips. Stir in milk, yolk, and butter until just combined. Whisk egg white until it just holds stiff peaks, then fold into batter gently but thoroughly.
Lightly brush waffle iron with oil and cook waffles according to manufacturer's instructions.

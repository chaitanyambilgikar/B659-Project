Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and onions and cook, stirring, until translucent, about 8 minutes.
Add the chopped tomatoes, green and red peppers, cayenne pepper, white wine, and sugar. Season with salt and pepper to taste, reduce the heat to low, and cook gently, stirring occasionally, for 35 minutes.
Heat the butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Pour in the beaten eggs, season with salt and pepper, and stir with a fork until they are cooked through. Remove from the heat.
In a nonstick pan over medium heat, brown the ham slices lightly on both sides, about 3 minutes on each side.
To serve, combine the scrambled eggs with the pepper and onion mixture and top each serving with a slice of ham.
Note: To peel tomatoes, place in boiling water for 30 seconds, plunge into cold water, and peel with a sharp knife.

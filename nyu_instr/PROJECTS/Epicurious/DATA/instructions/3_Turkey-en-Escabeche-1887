Place turkey in deep skillet. Add stock, half of onion, 1/3 cup vinegar, oil, peppercorns, allspice, bay leaves, rosemary, thyme and 1/2 teaspoon salt; bring to simmer. Cover and cook 20 minutes. Turn turkey, cover and continue simmering until cooked through, about 20 minutes. Transfer turkey, onion and herbs to large bowl. Add bell pepper and remaining onion. Pour hot cooking liquid over. Cover and chill overnight.
Remove turkey from liquid (if liquid has gelled, place over very low heat just until liquefied, but do not warm). Cut turkey from bones. Thinly slice meat. Arrange on platter. Add remaining 3 tablespoons vinegar to cooking liquid. Season with salt and pepper. Spoon vegetables and liquid over turkey.

For filling: Combine all ingredients in heavy large skillet. Stir over high heat until sugar dissolves and mixture comes to boil. Boil until very thick, stirring frequently, about 13 minutes. Cool in pan. (Can be prepared 2 days ahead. Transfer to small bowl, cover and refrigerate.)
For crust: Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350°F. Line 11-inch tart pan with removable bottom with heavy-duty foil, pressing firmly into scalloped sides of pan. Grease foil and dust with matzo cake meal. Finely grind nuts, sugar, salt and cloves in processor. Add egg and extract and process until mixture just holds together. Reserve 1/2 cup dough for another use. Using moistened fingertips, press remaining dough onto bottom and up sides of prepared pan. Bake until crust is golden, crinkled and feels dry, about 13 minutes. Cool crust completely in pan on rack. Remove tart pan sides. Carefully peel foil off crust. Return crust to pan. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Wrap tightly and store at room temperature.)
Spread filling over crust. Starting at edge of tart, cover tart with berry slices in overlapping concentric circles, with first circle leaning against crust edge. (Can be prepared 3 hours ahead. Chill.)
Remove tart from pan. Cut into wedges and serve.

Coarsely chop oats in a food processor and transfer to a large bowl. Pulse together flour, butter, brown sugar, baking powder, and salt in processor until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add milk and blend until mixture just forms a dough. Add to oats and knead until just incorporated.
Halve dough and pat each half into a 5- by 3-inch rectangle. Chill, wrapped well in plastic wrap, until firm, about 3 hours.
Preheat oven to 350°F.
Cut 1 rectangle crosswise into scant 1/4-inch-thick slices and bake on an ungreased large baking sheet in middle of oven until undersides are a shade darker, about 20 minutes. Transfer to a rack to cool and make more biscuits with remaining dough.

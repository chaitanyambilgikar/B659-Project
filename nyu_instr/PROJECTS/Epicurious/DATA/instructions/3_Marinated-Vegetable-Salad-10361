In a small bowl whisk together the vinegar, the mustard, the red pepper flakes, and salt and black pepper to taste, add in the oil in a stream, whisking, and whisk the dressing until it is emulsified. In a steamer set over the boiling water steam the onions, covered, for 2 minutes, add the carrots, the broccoli, and steam the vegetables for 3 minutes, or until they are crisp-tender. Transfer the vegetables to a colander and let them cool. In a bowl combine the steamed vegetables, the bell peppers, and the olives, toss the mixture with the dressing, and chill the salad, covered, for at least 4 hours or overnight.

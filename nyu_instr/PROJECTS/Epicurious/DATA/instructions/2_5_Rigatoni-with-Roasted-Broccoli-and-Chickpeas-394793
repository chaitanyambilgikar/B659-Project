Heat oven to 450°F. In a small saucepan over medium-high heat, sauté anchovies with oil and garlic until anchovies dissolve and garlic browns. Add chickpea liquid and bouillon to anchovies; cook, stirring, until bouillon dissolves. Pour anchovy mixture into roasting pan; add chickpeas and broccoli; stir to coat. Roast 20 minutes. Cook rigatoni as directed on package until al dente. Drain rigatoni, reserving 1 cup cooking liquid. Add pasta to chickpea-broccoli mixture; roast until pasta is completely cooked, adding reserved cooking liquid a little at a time and stirring to reach desired consistency, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from oven; let sit 5 minutes; serve topped with Romano.

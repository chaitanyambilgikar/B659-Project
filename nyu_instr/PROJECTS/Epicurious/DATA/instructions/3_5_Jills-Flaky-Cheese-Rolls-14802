Unroll croissant dough and cut into squares (if you bought the kind that is pre-cut into triangles then form squares by "glueing" two of them together with a little water).
Spread cream cheese as thickly as you want onto the dough and sprinkle chives on top.
Roll dough up like a jelly roll (rolling it in a crescent shape will make the cheese run out while baking). Pinch the edges closed if you want. Bake according to directions on dough package.
Serve to hungry guests.

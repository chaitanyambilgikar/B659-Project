Heat oil in heavy large ovenproof skillet over medium heat. Add fennel and half of garlic and sauté until almost tender, about 5 minutes. Pour in 1/3 cup chicken broth and sprinkle over half of fennel seeds. Cover and simmer until fennel is very tender and liquid is absorbed, about 10 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Cool.
Starting 1/2 inch up on 1 long side, cut through tenderloin to within 1/2 inch of opposite side. Open as for book. Continue cutting through thick portion of tenderloin until meat forms 1;/2-inch-thick rectangle. Spread fennel mixture evenly over pork. Beginning at 2 long end, roll pork up jelly roll style. Tie pork with stirring to secure. (Can be prepared 8 hours ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
Preheat oven to 425°F. Place pork in same skillet. Rub pork with remaining garlic clove and 1/4 teaspoon fennel seeds. Season with salt and pepper. Roast in oven until pork is cooked through, about 25 minutes. Remove pork from skillet and keep warm. Pour remaining 1/3 cup chicken broth into skillet. Boil until reduced by half, about 1 minute. Remove string from pork. Cut pork into 1-inch pieces. Divide between plates, cut side up. Spoon sauce over pork and serve.

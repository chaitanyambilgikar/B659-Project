Melt butter in heavy large saucepan over medium heat. Add leeks and potato; sauté until leeks are slightly softened but not brown, stirring often, about 5 minutes. Add 3 cups broth; bring to boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until vegetables are very tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Add watercress and spinach; stir until wilted, about 1 minute. Cool slightly.
Working with 1 cup at a time, puree soup in blender until smooth. Transfer soup to large bowl. Stir in lemon juice; season with salt and pepper. Chill until cold, about 2 hours. Thin with more broth, if desired.
Ladle soup into bowls. Garnish center of each with hard-boiled eggs and small watercress sprigs.

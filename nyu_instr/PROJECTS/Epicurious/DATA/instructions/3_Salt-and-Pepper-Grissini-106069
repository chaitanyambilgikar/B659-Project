Whisk together flours, baking powder, baking soda, sugar, and 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, then stir in buttermilk and butter with a fork. Transfer to a lightly floured surface and gently knead 5 or 6 times.
Preheat oven to 350°F.
Form dough into a log and cut into 16 pieces. Roll each piece into a 10-inch-long rope (if dough sticks, lightly flour work surface) and arrange 1/2 inch apart on 2 parchment-lined large baking sheets.
Brush breadsticks with beaten egg white and sprinkle with pepper and remaining kosher salt (to taste). Bake in upper and lower thirds of oven, switching position of sheets halfway through baking, until golden and crisp, 20 to 22 minutes total. Transfer to racks to cool.

Melt 1/4 cup butter in large pot over high heat. Add shallots and thyme; sauté until shallots begin to brown, about 4 minutes. Add all mushrooms; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Sauté until juices evaporate, about 10 minutes. Add Madeira; toss until evaporated, about 1 minute. Set aside.
Cook haricots verts in medium pot of boiling salted water until crisp-tender, about 4 minutes. Drain. Let stand until ready to use, up to 2 hours.
Add remaining 1 tablespoon butter to mushrooms in pot. Add haricots verts. Toss over medium-high heat until butter melts and vegetables are heated through, adding broth by tablespoonfuls if mixture is dry, about 3 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer vegetables to bowl and serve.

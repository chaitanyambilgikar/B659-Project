Split the rolls crosswise, leaving the halves barely attached. Pull out some of the soft insides to make room for the gelato. Place a scoop of gelato into each brioche and sprinkle the chocolate over the exposed gelato. Close up and serve immediately. (Other traditional fillings include lemon, espresso, pistachio, and almond granita or gelato. For alternative toppings, try toasted coconut, pralines, or chopped almonds, walnuts, or pistachios.)

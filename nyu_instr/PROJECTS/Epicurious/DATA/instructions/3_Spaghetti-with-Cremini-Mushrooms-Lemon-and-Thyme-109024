Cook pasta in a large pot ofboiling salted water until barely al dente.
While pasta is cooking, stir together bread crumbs, 1 tablespoon olive oil, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a bowl until combined well. Transfer to a 12-inch heavy skillet and cook over moderate heat, stirring, until golden, 3 to 5 minutes, then return to bowl.
Heat 2 tablespoons butter and remaining 2 tablespoons oil in skillet over moderately high heat until foam subsides, then sauté mushrooms, stirring, until golden, about 4 minutes. Add zest and garlic and sauté, stirring, until mushrooms exude liquid, about 3 minutes. Add Worcestershire sauce and lemon juice and cook until most of liquid is evaporated, about 2 minutes. Stir in thyme, pepper, and remaining 3/4 teaspoon salt.
Reserve 1 cup pasta cooking water, then drain pasta in a colander.
Transfer mushrooms to pasta pot, then add 1/2 cup reserved cooking water and bring to a boil. Stir in parsley and remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Return pasta to pot and add cheese, tossing to combine. If pasta seems dry, moisten with more cooking water.
Serve pasta sprinkled with bread crumbs and additional cheese.

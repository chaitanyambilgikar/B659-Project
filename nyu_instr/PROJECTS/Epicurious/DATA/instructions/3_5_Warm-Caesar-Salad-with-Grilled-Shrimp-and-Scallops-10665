In a small bowl whisk together half the garlic paste, 2 tablespoons of the oil, and salt and pepper to taste, add the bread cubes, and toss the mixture well. Bake the bread cubes on a baking sheet in the middle of a preheated 350° F. oven for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the croutons are golden.
In a large bowl whisk together the remaining garlic paste, 2 tablespoons of the remaining oil, the anchovy paste, the lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste until the dressing is combined well. In a bowl toss the shrimp and the scallops with the remaining 1 tablespoon oil and salt and pepper to taste and grill them in a ridged grill pan or on an oiled rack set about 6 inches over glowing coals for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, or until the shrimp are cooked through and the scallops are opaque. Transfer the shell fish to the large bowl, add the romaine and 1 tablespoon of the Parmesan, and toss the salad well. Divide the salad between 2 plates and sprinkle the croutons and 1/2 tablespoon of the remaining Parmesan over each serving.

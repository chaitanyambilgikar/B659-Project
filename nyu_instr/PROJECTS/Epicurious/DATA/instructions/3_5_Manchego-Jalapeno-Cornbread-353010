Preheat the oven to 400°F. Grease an 8-inch-square baking pan. Combine the cornmeal, flour, 4 ounces of the grated Manchego, the sugar, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl. Mince 1 tablespoon of the jalapeños and combine it with the milk, oil, and eggs in a small bowl; mix well. Add the milk mixture to the flour mixture and stir just until blended. Pour into the prepared pan.
Lay the remaining jalapeño slices on top of the batter approximately 3 inches apart (the idea is for each piece of cornbread to get a slice of jalapeño on top) and sprinkle with the remaining 2 ounces of Manchego. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until a wooden pick inserted into center comes out clean. Serve warm.

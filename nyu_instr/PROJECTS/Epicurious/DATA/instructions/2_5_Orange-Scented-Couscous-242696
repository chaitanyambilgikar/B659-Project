Mix 2 cups water, 2 tablespoons juice, oil, and peel in medium saucepan; bring to boil. Stir in couscous; cover and remove from heat. Let stand until liquid is absorbed and couscous is tender, about 12 minutes. Fluff with fork, adding orange juice by tablespoonfuls to taste. Season with salt and pepper.

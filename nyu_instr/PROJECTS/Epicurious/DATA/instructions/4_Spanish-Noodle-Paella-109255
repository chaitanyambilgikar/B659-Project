Place 1 tablespoon water in cup; mix in saffron. Heat oil in large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion, bell pepper, 3 tablespoons parsley, and garlic. Sauté until onion is lightly browned, about 4 minutes. Mix in tomatoes. Simmer until almost all tomato juices have evaporated, about 3 minutes. Stir in tomato paste, paprika, and saffron mixture. (Sauce base can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.)
Bring clam juice to boil in large wide pot over medium-high heat. Add lobster. Cover; boil until lobster is red, about 4 minutes. Remove pot from heat. Using tongs, transfer lobster to rimmed baking sheet; reserve lobster broth in pot. Cool lobster 15 minutes. Twist tail off body. Cut tail in half lengthwise; remove meat. Twist off claws. Split claw shells with cleaver and remove meat. Cut meat into 1- to 1 1/2-inch pieces. Strain juices from sheet into 4-cup measuring cup. Strain in broth from pot. If necessary, add enough water to measure 3 cups broth mixture.
Heat sauce base in paella pan or very large skillet over medium heat. Add noodle pieces; stir 1 minute. Add 3 cups broth mixture; bring to boil, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat and simmer until noodles are almost tender, about 12 minutes. Mix in mussels and 1 cup water. Cover and cook until mussels open, about 5 minutes; discard any that do not open. Mix in shrimp, scallops, and lobster. Cover; simmer until seafood is just cooked through, adding water by 1/4 cupfuls if paella is dry, about 6 minutes. Uncover; simmer until noodles are tender, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper; sprinkle with 1 tablespoon parsley.

Using small sharp knife, cut diagonal slits on both sides of fish at 1-inch intervals. Arrange fish on rimmed baking sheet. Sprinkle fresh orange juice and salt into slits and cavities of fish. Fill cavities with orange slices (about 3 per fish). Cover loosely and let stand at room temperature at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour.
Spray grill racks and fish generously with nonstick spray. Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Place saucepan with orange-saffron butter at edge of grill to warm through, stirring occasionally. Arrange fish on barbecue. Grill until just opaque in center, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer to plates. Serve with warm seasoned butter.

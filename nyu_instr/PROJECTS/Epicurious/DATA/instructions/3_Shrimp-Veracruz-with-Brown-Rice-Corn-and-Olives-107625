Combine 6 cups water, 2 cups rice, and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt in heavy large saucepan. Bring to boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium, cover, and cook just until rice is tender, about 30 minutes. Stir in corn, then drain. Transfer rice mixture to large bowl. Refrigerate until cold, stirring occasionally, about 1 hour. Mix in green onions, bell peppers, and olives.
Boil shrimp in large pot of boiling salted water until cooked through, about 3 minutes. Drain; set aside. Blend salsa, oil, lime juice, cumin, and lime peel in processor until dressing is smooth. Stir half of dressing into rice mixture. (Can be made up to 8 hours ahead. Cover shrimp, rice mixture, and remaining dressing separately and chill.)
Mix shrimp and remaining dressing into rice mixture. Season salad with salt and pepper. Transfer salad to large platter. Garnish with lime wedges.

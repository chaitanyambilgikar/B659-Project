Make dressing: Combine all the ingredients except the oil. When the salt is fully dissolved, add oil.
Yield: 3/4 cup (150 ml).
Make salad: 1. Have ready a large saucepan of boiling water (enough to cover the lobster) and a bowl of iced water. Add a pinch of sea salt to the boiling water and scald the lobster over high heat for 4 minutes. Plunge the lobster into the iced water, then remove the meat from the shell. Cut into bite-size pieces.
2. Bring about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of oil in a small saucepan to 320°F (160°C). Deep-fry the garlic slices until crisp.
3. Lightly grill the mushroom caps.
4. Arrange the salad greens, mushrooms, and lobster on a serving dish. Pour the Spicy Lemon Dressing over all and decorate with the garlic chips.

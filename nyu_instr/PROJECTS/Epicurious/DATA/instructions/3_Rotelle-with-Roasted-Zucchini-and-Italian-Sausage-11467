Arrange the zucchini in a jelly-roll pan, drizzle it with the oil, and roast it in the middle of a preheated 450°F. oven, stirring occasionally, for 15 to 20 minutes, or until it is golden. While the zucchini is roasting, discard the casings from the sausage, in a heavy skillet cook the meat over moderate heat, stirring and breaking up the lumps, until it is no longer pink, and transfer it with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain. In a large bowl stir together the zucchini, the sausage, the mint, the yogurt, and salt and pepper to taste. In a kettle of boiling salted water boil the rotelle until it is al dente, drain it well, and toss it with the zucchini mixture.

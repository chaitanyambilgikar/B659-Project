For sauce: Whisk all ingredients in medium bowl to blend. Season to taste with salt and pepper. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and refrigerate.
For corn dogs: Using on/off turns, blend shrimp and coarse salt in processor until coarsely chopped. Add egg, cream, Worcestershire sauce, Cajun seasoning, and hot pepper sauce. Process until smooth. Mix lobster, corn, and green onions in large bowl. Add shrimp puree; fold in until blended.
Divide mixture into 12 equal portions (scant 1/3 cup each). Using moistened hands, form each into 3x11/2-inch log and place on baking sheet, spacing apart. Insert ice-pop stick into 1 end of each log, pushing through almost to other end. Cover and chill at least 4 hours and up to 6 hours.
Beer batter: Whisk first 4 ingredients in medium bowl. Whisk in beer.
Add enough oil to heavy large saucepan to reach depth of 3 inches. Attach deep-fry thermometer to side of pan. Heat oil to 350°F. Dip 1 corn dog into batter; turn to coat corn dog plus 1/2 inch of stick. Let float in hot oil. Repeat with 3 more corn dogs. Fry until golden brown and crisp and centers are cooked through, occasionally grasping sticks with tongs to turn carefully, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Repeat in 2 more batches with remaining corn dogs and batter. Serve hot with sauce for dipping.

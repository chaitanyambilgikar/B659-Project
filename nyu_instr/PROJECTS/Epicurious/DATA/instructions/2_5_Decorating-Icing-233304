Beat together all ingredients in a large bowl with an electric mixer at medium speed until just combined, about 1 minute.
Increase speed to high and continue to beat until icing holds stiff peaks, about 3 minutes in a stand mixer or 10 minutes with a handheld. If not using icing immediately, cover surface with a dampened paper towel, then cover bowl with plastic wrap.

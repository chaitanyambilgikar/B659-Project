Serve pie with Hot Caramel Sauce.
To make Hot Caramel Sauce: Combine brown sugar, corn syrup, whipping cream, butter and salt in heavy medium saucepan. Stir over low heat until sugar dissolves, about 4 minutes. Increase heat to medium-high. Boil sauce without stirring until mixture registers 238°F (soft-ball stage) on candy thermometer, about 11 minutes. Cool slightly. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Reheat over low heat, stirring constantly.) Makes about 2 cups.

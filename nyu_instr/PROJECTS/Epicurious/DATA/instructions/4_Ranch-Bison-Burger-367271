Cut 2 ounces cheddar into 1/4-inch dice; grate remaining 2 ounces cheddar. In a bowl, combine diced cheddar, bison, jalapeño, zest, chili powder, salt and pepper. Form bison mixture into four 3/4-inch-thick patties. Coat a grill rack or grill pan with cooking spray; heat over medium-high heat. Cook patties 5 minutes; flip and top each with 1/4 of grated cheddar; grill until internal temperature reaches 160°F, about 5 minutes. Place a patty on bottom of each roll. Garnish with zest and onion, lettuce, pickled jalapeño and ranch dressing, if desired. Top with other half of roll.

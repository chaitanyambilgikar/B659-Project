In a small bowl soak porcini in 3 cups of boiling water 30 minutes. Remove porcini, squeeze out excess liquid, and reserve soaking liquid. Rinse porcini to remove any grit and pat dry. Chop porcini. Line a sieve set over a bowl with a dampened paper towel or coffee filter and pour reserved soaking liquid through it.
In a 6-quart kettle bring 5 quarts salted water to a boil for pasta.
In a large heavy skillet cook shallot, garlic, and fresh mushrooms with salt and pepper to taste in butter over moderate heat, stirring until mushrooms are tender. Add wine, stock, and porcini soaking liquid and boil until liquid is reduced by half.
Cook pasta in boiling water until al dente.
While pasta is cooking, add cream and porcini to wine mixture and boil sauce until thickened, about 5 minutes. Drain pasta in a colander and transfer to a large bowl. Add sauce, Parmesan, and truffle oil and toss well. Season pasta with salt and pepper to taste.

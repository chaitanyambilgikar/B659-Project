1. Cut tomatoes into different shapes (thin wedges, halves, dice); place in a bowl. Combine with the onion, half of the parsley, corn, basil, lemon zest, juice, pepper, and 4 tablespoons oil. Set side.
2. Rub butter on the skin side of the fish; season both sides with salt and pepper. Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Cook fish, skin-side down, until golden brown, about 6 minutes. Turn carefully; cook 3 to 4 minutes more.
3. Spoon tomato mixture onto 4 plates; top with a fillet. Drizzle with lemon juice; garnish with remaining parsley and serve.

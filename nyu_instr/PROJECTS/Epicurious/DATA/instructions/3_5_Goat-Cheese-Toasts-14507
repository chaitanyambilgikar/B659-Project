On a baking sheet broil the bread slices under a preheated broiler about 3 inches from the heat for 1 to 2 minutes on each side, our until they are golden, and brush on side of each toast lightly with the oil. spread the oiled sides evenly with the goat cheese, covering them completely, and sprinkle the cheese with pepper to taste. Return the goat cheese toasts to the broiler and broil them for 1 minute, or until the cheese is melted slightly and glistening. Serve the toasts warm or a room temperature.

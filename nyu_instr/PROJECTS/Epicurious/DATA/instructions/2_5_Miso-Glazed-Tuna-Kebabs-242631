Heat miso, mirin, sugar, and water in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring, until sugar has dissolved. Remove from heat and whisk in mayonnaise, then cool to room temperature.
Put tuna in a sealable bag (or nonreactive shallow dish). Pour marinade over tuna and marinate, chilled, at least 1 hour.
Prepare grill for direct-heat cooking over hot charcoal (high heat for gas).
Thread tuna onto skewers, leaving a small space between each piece. Put on a tray.
Generously oil grill rack, then grill skewers, turning once, until just pink in center, about 4 minutes total. Let stand 5 minutes.

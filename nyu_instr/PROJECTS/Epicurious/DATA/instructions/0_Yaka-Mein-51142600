Cook spaghetti according to package directions. While spaghetti is cooking, bring stock and Cajun Seasoning to a boil in a large pot. Add meat and simmer 5 minutes. Reserving stock, strain meat out. Set meat aside and keep warm. Bring stock back to a boil and stir in soy sauce. Simmer 1 minute.
To assemble, place drained spaghetti in 6 individual bowls. Divide meat and egg halves over spaghetti. Ladle on broth and sprinkle with green onions.

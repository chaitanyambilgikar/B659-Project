Lightly oil 6-cup ring mold. Place raspberry Jell-O in large bowl. Bring wine to simmer in small saucepan. Add wine to Jell-O and stir until Jell-O is dissolved, about 2 minutes. Stir in orange juice and lemon juice. Place bowl in larger bowl filled with ice and water. Cool until Jell-O begins to set slightly, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, grate 1 tablespoon peel from oranges. Cut remaining peel and white pith from oranges; discard. Cut between membranes; release segments.
Add orange segments and peel, 1 cup grapes and 1 cup strawberries to Jell-O; stir to blend well. Pour mixture into mold. Chill at least 6 hours or overnight.
Run knife around mold sides to loosen Jell-O. Place mold in bowl filled with enough hot water to come halfway up sides of mold for 30 seconds. Place platter atop mold; invert Jell-O onto platter. Garnish with additional fruit.

Exact quantities cannot be given for the tutti-frutti. Preferably, start at the beginning of the fresh fruit season — if you start later, the variety of fruits will be more limited. Pour 1 bottle of brandy into a large crock or big preserving jar. Add hulled, washed and drained strawberries and their weight in sugar. Cover the crock and let it stand in a cool place. As other fruits come into season, add them in any desired quantity with their weight in sugar. Add more brandy if the fruits are not completely covered. You may add other berries, cherries, seeded grapes, peeled and pitted peaches, peeled and cored pears, pitted and halved plums or apricots. When the crock is full, cover securely. Leave 3 months before using.

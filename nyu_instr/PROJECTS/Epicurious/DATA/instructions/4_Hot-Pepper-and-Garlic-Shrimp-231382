Pat shrimp dry. Cook garlic, red pepper flakes, and sea salt in oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately low heat, stirring occasionally, until garlic is pale golden, 4 to 5 minutes. Increase heat to moderately high, then add shrimp and sauté, turning occasionally, until shrimp are just cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in lemon juice, then transfer to a serving bowl. Serve warm or at room temperature.

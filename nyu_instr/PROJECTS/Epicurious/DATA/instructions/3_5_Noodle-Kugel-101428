Preheat the oven to 350°F. Boil the noodles until al dente, and drain. In a large mixing bowl, combine drained noodles and remaining ingredients (through and including vanilla extract) and toss well. Transfer the mixture to a buttered 13 x 9 x 2-inch baking dish, and bake 40 minutes, uncovered. Cover with foil and bake an additional 20 minutes, or until cooked through. Remove from oven and let cool before cutting into squares. Serve warm or at room temperature with sour cream and/or fresh berries on the side, if desired.

Bring clam juice to simmer in large skillet over medium heat. Add shrimp; cover and simmer until opaque, turning once, about 2 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer shrimp to cutting board; coarsely chop shrimp. Place shrimp in small bowl. Boil cooking liquid until reduced to 2 tablespoons, about 2 minutes. Cool.
Mix onions and next 5 ingredients in large bowl to blend. Stir in shrimp, cooking liquid and crabmeat. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and chill. Preheat oven to 375°F. Lightly brush oil over both sides of each bread slice. Arrange bread on baking sheet in single layer. Bake until bread is crisp and golden, about 4 minutes per side. Cool. (Seafood salad and toasts can be made 1 day ahead. Keep seafood salad chilled. Store toasts airtight at room temperature.)
Spread seafood salad evenly over toasts. Arrange on serving dish. Garnish with lemon wedges and serve.

In a bowl whisk together the soy sauce, the gingerroot, the honey, the Sherry, the vinegar, and the garlic paste. Flatten the chicken breast halves between sheets of plastic wrap until they are about 1/2 inch thick and let them marinate in the soy mixture, turning them once, for 20 minutes. Transfer the chicken, reserving the marinade in a small saucepan, skin sides down, to the oiled rack of a broiler pan and broil it under a preheated broiler about 6 inches from the heat for 5 minutes. While the chicken is cooking boil the reserved marinade until it is reduced by half. Brush the chicken with some of the marinade, turn it, and brush it with the remaining marinade. Broil the chicken for 6 to 8 minutes more, or until it is just cooked through, transfer it to a cutting board, and cut it on the diagonal into 1/2-inch-thick slices.

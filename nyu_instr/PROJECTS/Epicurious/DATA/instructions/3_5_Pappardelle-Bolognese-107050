Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add bacon; sauté until beginning to brown, about 6 minutes. Add onion, celery, carrot, garlic, and thyme; sauté 5 minutes. Add veal and pork; sauté until brown and cooked through, breaking up meat with back of fork, about 10 minutes. Add wine and bay leaves. Simmer until liquid is slightly reduced, about 10 minutes. Add broth and tomato puree. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer until sauce thickens, stirring often, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cool slightly. Refrigerate uncovered until cold, then cover and keep chilled. Bring to simmer before using.)
Boil pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite, stirring often. Drain. Transfer to pot with sauce; toss. Serve with Parmesan.

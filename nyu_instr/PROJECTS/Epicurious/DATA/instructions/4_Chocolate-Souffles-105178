Butter and flour ten 3/4-cup ramekins. Melt chocolate and butter in medium bowl set over pan of simmering water, stirring occasionally. Remove bowl from over water and cool chocolate mixture to lukewarm.
Using electric mixer at high speed, beat sugar, eggs, yolks, and salt in large bowl until batter falls in heavy ribbon when beaters are lifted, about 6 minutes. Sift flour over mixture and fold in. Gradually fold in lukewarm chocolate mixture. Divide mixture among prepared ramekins. (Can be prepared ahead. Cover soufflés individually with plastic and refrigerate up to 1 day or freeze up to 1 week.)
Preheat oven to 400°F. Place ramekins on baking sheet; bake soufflés until puffed and beginning to crack on top (centers will still be soft), about 18 minutes (19 minutes if frozen), and serve.

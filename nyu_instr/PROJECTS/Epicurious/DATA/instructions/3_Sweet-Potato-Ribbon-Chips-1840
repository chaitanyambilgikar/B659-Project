Place potato flat on work surface, holding one end. Using vegetable peeler and starting at center of potato, shave into long, wide ribbons in quick strokes. Turn potato and continue shaving opposite end. Turn potato over and repeat process for each side. Repeat with remaining potatoes.
Heat oil to 375°F in heavy, wide, 4-inch-deep pot. Shake one handful of potatoes in oil; do not crowd. Fry until crisp and slightly golden, stirring occasionally, 30 to 60 seconds. Remove with slotted spoon; drain on paper towels. Season with salt. Repeat with remaining potatoes in batches. (Can be prepared 6 hours ahead. Cover lightly and store at room temperature.)

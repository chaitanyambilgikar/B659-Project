Whisk together flour, cornmeal, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Whisk in egg, milk, and 1/2 tablespoon oil until combined.
Brush a griddle or a 12-inch (nonstick or well-seasoned cast-iron) skillet with oil and heat over moderate heat until hot. Using a scant 1/8 cup batter for each cake, cook corn cakes in batches of 4 until bubbles appear on surface and undersides are golden, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Turn over with a spatula and cook until undersides are golden, about 45 seconds more. (Corn cakes will be thin.) Transfer to a plate and keep warm, covered. Stir batter and brush griddle or skillet with oil between batches.

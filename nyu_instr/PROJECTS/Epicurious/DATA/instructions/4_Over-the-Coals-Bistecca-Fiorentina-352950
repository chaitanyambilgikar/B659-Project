Prepare a hot fire in a campfire or wood-fired grill, then let the coals burn down to hot chunks of embers (a 6- to 7-second fire).
Place the steak directly on the hot coals and sear. Turn the steak and season generously with salt and pepper. Cook for 5 to 6 minutes, until the steak is charred on one side and can easily be removed from the coals. Turn and season with more salt, pepper, and the thyme. Cook for 5 to 6 minutes on the second side for medium-rare. If using a grill, the time needed for cooking will be 5 minutes more or so per side since the meat is above the coals rather than in the coals. Remove from the heat and let rest for 5 minutes.
Toss the arugula with the garlic, the 2 tablespoons olive oil, the lemon juice, and salt to taste.
Carve the steak into 1/4-inch-thick diagonal slices. Serve immediately, topped with the arugula salad, coarse sea salt or smoked salt, and shavings of Parmesan cheese. Drizzle with more olive oil if desired.

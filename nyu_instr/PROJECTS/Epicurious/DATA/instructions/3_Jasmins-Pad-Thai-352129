Get your mise completely ready to go, because this dish only takes about 5 minutes to cook.
In a wok (of course you can use a frying pan, but it's just not the same; even those cheap stainless steel ones work better than a pan), fry the red onion in a little peanut or olive oil. Add the shrimp (or calamari, chicken, or pork). Cook for a minute. They'll continue so donít worry too much if theyíre still slightly opaque, and move them over to the side. Make a well in the center. Crack the egg in there and scramble with a fork till cooked. Push over to the side along with the shrimp.
Break the noodles in half (unless your wok is the huge industrial size), and add to the center with about 1/4 cup of the stock, the Ô¨Å sh sauce, tamarind sauce, palm sugar (dissolve it in a little hot water if too thick), and red chile Ô¨Çakes. Mix well into the noodles, leaving the shrimp and scrambled egg off to the side.
Cook the noodles in the sauce for a few minutes, stirring lightly to ensure that they donít clump together. The noodles should be just softenedóyou want them nice and chewy. Taste and adjust the seasoningóand add more stock if necessary.
Now add the bean sprouts and the scallions, stir everything together, and heat it through. Immediately turn onto large plate and top with the chopped cashews. Garnish with lime and cucumber slices.
You now just need a pair of chopsticks and an ice cold Singha.

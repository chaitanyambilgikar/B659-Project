1. Rinse the toast, and pat it dry. Place in a Dutch oven, and pour in enough water to come halfway up the sides of the roast. Cover and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for about 1 hour, turning occasionally. Remove the beef from the pan, setting it side until cool enough to handle. Reserve the cooking liquid in the pan.
2. Make several slits along the top of the beef. Combine the salt, pepper, cloves, nutmeg, mace, marjoram, savory, thyme, and parsley, and rub the mixture into the slits and over the surface of the roast. Coat all over with the egg yolk.
3. Return the roast to the Dutch oven. Pour in the red wine and balsamic vinegar, stirring to combine with the cooking liquid. Cover and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat, cover, and simmer for about 1 hour, until the roast is tender. Add the onion, cover again, and continue simmering for about 1 hour more, turning occasionally and stirring the gravy until the beef is fork-tender.
4. Transfer the roast to a cutting board, and cover loosely with aluminum foil. Stir the gravy, and bring back to a simmer. Add more salt and pepper, if necessary, and whisk in the butter, stirring until dissolved and the gravy is smooth.
5. To serve, cut the beef into thin slices, and arrange on a platter. Pour some of the gravy over the beef. Surround with boiled potatoes, and pour more gravy over the potatoes. Pour the remaining gravy into a sauceboat, and serve on the side. Garnish the roast and potatoes with orange slices, and send to the table.

Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat and add a generous amount of kosher salt. Stir in the bucatini, return the water to a boil, and cook the pasta, stirring occasionally to prevent the strands from sticking together, until it's al dente. (Since cooking times vary, for perfectly cooked pasta, refer to the package instructions for the recommended time and taste the pasta frequently while it cooks.)
Put the tapenade in a large skillet.
Drain the pasta and quickly add it, still dripping with water, to the skillet with the tapenade. Place the skillet over medium heat and cook the pasta, gently stirring to coat the pasta with the tapenade, until it's warmed through, about 1 minute.
Turn off the heat, add the basil, parsley, and sun-dried tomatoes and toss to combine.
Use tongs to lift the pasta out of the skillet and pile it onto four plates, dividing it evenly and twisting it into high mounds.
Finish each serving with a drizzle of olive oil, a pinch of sea salt, freshly ground black pepper, and Parmesan cheese shavings.

Thinly sliced green onion tops Whisk first 4 ingredients and 1 tablespoon water in small bowl to blend. Set sauce aside.
Heat 1 teaspoon vegetable oil and 1/4 teaspoon sesame oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add bok choy; cook until wilted and brown in spots, turning often with tongs, about 3 minutes. Divide bok choy between 2 plates. Add remaining 1 teaspoon vegetable oil and 1/4 teaspoon sesame oil to same skillet. Sprinkle scallops with pepper; add to skillet. Sear scallops until brown and just opaque in center, about 1 1/2 minutes per side. Remove pan from heat. Place scallops between bok choy. Add miso sauce to skillet; stir just until warm, about 3 seconds (if too thick, add more water by teaspoonfuls). Drizzle sauce over scallops and bok choy. Sprinkle with green onions.

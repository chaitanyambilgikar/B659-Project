Stir together cabbage, wasabi mayonnaise, and vinegar in medium bowl. Let stand 15 minutes. Sprinkle fish fillets on both sides with salt and pepper. Place panko in shallow dish. Dredge fish in panko, turning to coat evenly.
Heat oil in heavy large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add fish and cook until golden brown and opaque in center, about 4 minutes per side.
Meanwhile, toast sandwich buns.
Place 1 bun bottom on each of 4 plates. Top each with fish. Squeeze lemon over fish. Spoon slaw over. Cover with bun tops and serve.

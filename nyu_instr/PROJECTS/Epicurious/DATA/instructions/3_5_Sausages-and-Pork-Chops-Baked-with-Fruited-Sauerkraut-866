Preheat oven to 350°F. Cook bacon in heavy large Dutch oven over medium-high heat until brown and almost crisp, about 5 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towels. Add pork chops to Dutch oven; cook over medium-high heat until golden, about 6 minutes per side. Transfer to plate. Add sausages to Dutch oven; stir until golden, about 3 minutes. Transfer to plate with pork chops. Reduce heat to medium. Add onions and carrots to Dutch oven and sauté until tender, about 8 minutes.
Add broth, wine, sauerkraut, and bacon to Dutch oven; stir to blend. Cover and bake 45 minutes.
Mix apricots and prunes into sauerkraut. Arrange pork chops and sausages over sauerkraut. Cover Dutch oven; bake until chops are cooked through and most of liquid is absorbed, about 30 minutes. Serve hot, passing mustards separately.

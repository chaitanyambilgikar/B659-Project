1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Spray a 9-by-5-inch loaf pan with cooking spray.
2. In a large bowl, combine all the ingredients but the hard-boiled eggs.
3. Press half the mixture into the pan, then gently press in the hard-boiled eggs, end to end. Mold the remaining mixture on top.
4. Cover with foil and bake until the juices run clear when you poke the loaf with a sharp knife, 1 1/2 hours.
5. Remove from oven and let cool for 30 minutes. Take the loaf from the pan, let it cool completely, then wrap it well and chill overnight.

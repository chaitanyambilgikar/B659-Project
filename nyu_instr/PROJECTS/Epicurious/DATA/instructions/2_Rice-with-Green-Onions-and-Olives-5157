Using vegetable peeler, remove peel (yellow part only) from lemon in long strips.
Heat olive oil in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat. Add sliced green onions and sauté until soft, about 2 minutes. Add 3 cups water, rice, 1 teaspoon salt and lemon peel. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to low. Cover and cook without stirring until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, about 20 minutes. Discard lemon peel. Mix chopped olives and parsley into rice. Cover and let stand 2 minutes. Transfer to bowl.

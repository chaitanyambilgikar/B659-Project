1. Transfer the turkey to a platter and pour any juices that have accumulated in the cavity into the roasting pan.
2. Chop the giblets until quite fine but not into a purée.
3. If the pan is swimming in juices, pour all the juices into a glass pitcher and skim off and discard the fat with a ladle. If you're making gravy, put 3 tablespoons (45 milliliters) of the fat back in the roasting pan.
4. If there are less than 2 cups (500 milliliters) of juices in the roasting pan, put the pan on the stove over high heat. Move the pan around every couple of minutes so it's heated evenly. Continue in this way until a brown crust forms on the bottom of the pan and the only liquid in the pan is a layer of shiny liquid fat. Pour out the fat; if you're making gravy, leave 3 tablespoons (45 milliliters) of the fat in the pan.
5. If you're making gravy, add 3 tablespoons (45 milliliters) of flour to the fat in the pan and stir over medium heat until it smells toasty, about 3 minutes. Whether making a jus or gravy, add the broth and bring to a simmer. Scrape the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon to dissolve the juices. Stir in the giblets. Whisk in the butter, if using. Season with salt and pepper.

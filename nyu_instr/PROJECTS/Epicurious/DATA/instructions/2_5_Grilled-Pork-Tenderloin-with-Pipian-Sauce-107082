Place pork between 2 sheets of waxed paper. Pound to 1/4- to 1/2-inch thickness. (Can be made 4 hours ahead. Cover; chill.)
Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add next 5 ingredients. Sauté until seeds are lightly browned, about 4 minutes. Set aside.
Place 4 cups water, tomatillos, and jalapeño in small saucepan. Simmer over medium heat until tomatillos are soft and olive-green color, about 15 minutes. Drain, reserving 1/4 cup cooking liquid. Transfer tomatillos, jalapeño, reserved 1/4 cup liquid, cilantro, lettuce, broth, radishes, and seed mixture to blender. Blend sauce until smooth, stopping occasionally to push down ingredients.
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in large skillet over medium heat. Add sauce; cook until thickened, about 4 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.)
Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Sprinkle pork with salt and pepper. Grill until cooked through, about 2 minutes per side. Divide among 4 plates. Stir sauce over medium heat until heated through. Spoon sauce over pork.
* Green tomato-like vegetables with paper-thin husks. Available at Latin American markets and some supermarkets.

Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms, onion and bell pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until pepper begins to soften, 4 to 5 minutes. Add beans, paprika, garlic powder and black pepper. Cook, smashing beans with the back of a spoon, 1 to 2 minutes more. Transfer mixture to a bowl and mix in eggs, mustard, Worcestershire sauce and breadcrumbs. Form into 4 patties. Wipe out skillet; heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil over medium heat and cook burgers until brown and feels firm, 6 to 7 minutes each side. Place on buns; top with barbecue sauce, lettuce and tomato.

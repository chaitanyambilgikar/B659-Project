1. If using anchovies packed in salt, cover in water and soak in a glass bowl for 30 minutes. Drain well. Using a paper towel, remove the outer skin. Split the fillet to remove the bone. Place the anchovies in a small bowl and add red pepper flakes. Pour over olive oil to cover. If using anchovies packed in oil, simply remove the anchovy fillets from the oil and transfer to a small bowl. Add red pepper flakes and pour over fresh olive oil. Set aside.
2. Meanwhile, roast peppers on their sides on racks of gas burners and turn flame on high. (Or broil on rack of a broiler pan about 2 inches from heat.) Roast, turning with tongs, until skins are blackened, 5 to 8 minutes.
3. Transfer roasted peppers to a bowl, then cover and let steam 10 minutes. Peel, seed, and cut into strips. Set aside.
4. In a large bowl toss eggplant, zucchini, and red onions with olive oil. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Grill vegetables over medium heat on a grill pan or grill in batches on a rack set about 4 inches over glowing coals, turning them, for 10 to 15 minutes, or until tender.
5. Arrange roasted peppers, grilled vegetables, and olives on a large platter. Place the bowl of anchovies on the platter. Serve with crusty bread.

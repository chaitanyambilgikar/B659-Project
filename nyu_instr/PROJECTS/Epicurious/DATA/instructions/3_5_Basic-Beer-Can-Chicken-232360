Apply your favorite spice rub, if desired, under and on skin of one 3- to 4-pound whole chicken. Add salt and pepper to taste.
"Stand" the chicken onto an open beer can (filled halfway with beer or seasoned liquid from the article in the August issue) so that the can is inside the cavity. Stand upright on grill. Grill, covered, over indirect medium heat (see specifics below) until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh reads 175°F.
For charcoal grill:Rake hot coals to the sides and roast chicken over drip pan containing a half an inch of water for one hour. Add 12 more briquets; leave uncovered until smoking. Recover and continue cooking.
For gas grill: Leave one burner off and put chicken over unlit burner for cooking time.

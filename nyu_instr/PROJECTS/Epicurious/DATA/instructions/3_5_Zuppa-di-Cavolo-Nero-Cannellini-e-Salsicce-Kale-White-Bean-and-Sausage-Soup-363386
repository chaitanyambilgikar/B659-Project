Sauté the crumbled sausage in the oil until browned, and reserve. Sauté the onions and garlic until translucent.
Add to the chicken stock in a big pot. Add the wine and cook until the alcohol has evaporated, then add the thyme and kale. Bring to a boil, then cover and simmer for 15 minutes. Add the cooked sausage and the beans and simmer another 15 minutes.

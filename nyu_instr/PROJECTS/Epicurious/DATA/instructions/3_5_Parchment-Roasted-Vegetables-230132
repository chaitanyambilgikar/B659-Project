Preheat oven to 400°F. Wash and thinly slice vegetables (use a mandoline for more uniform results). Place in a large bowl and toss vegetables with remaining ingredients. Cut a sheet of parchment the size of a cookie sheet and line pan with it. Spread vegetables without overlapping; season with salt and pepper. Bake until vegetable edges are golden brown, about 30 minutes.

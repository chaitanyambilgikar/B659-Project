Cook onion, garlic, salt, and black pepper in oil in a 2- to 3-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until golden, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer to a blender and purée with cashews, tomato paste, cayenne, and 2 cups broth until very smooth, about 1 minute. Return to saucepan and stir in remaining 1 cups broth, then simmer, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 1 minute. Season soup with salt.

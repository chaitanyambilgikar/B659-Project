Preheat oven to 250°F. Line 2 cookie sheets with parchment paper. Trace six 3-inch circles on each paper.
Using electric mixer, beat first 3 ingredients to soft peaks. Gradually add sugar and beat to stiff glossy peaks. Transfer whites to pastry bag fitted with 1/4-inch plain tip. Beginning in the center of each circle, pipe concentric circles to fill traced circle. Bake until meringues are dry, about 2 hours.(Can be prepared 2 days ahead. Store in oven.)
Gently spread 1/4 cup yogurt evenly on 6 meringues. Top with remaining meringues. Freeze until firm.
Place cocoa and espresso in sieve. Lightly sprinkle over tops of meringue and serve immediately.

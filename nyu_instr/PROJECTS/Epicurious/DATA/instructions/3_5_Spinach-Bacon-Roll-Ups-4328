Cook bacon in heavy large skillet over medium heat until crisp; drain. Crumble bacon into medium bowl; stir in spinach and next 5 ingredients.
Heat 1 tortilla in large skillet over high heat until warm and pliable, about 1 minute per side. Transfer to work surface. Spread 1/3 of filling over tortilla, leaving 1/2-inch border. Roll up tightly, enclosing filling. Wrap in plastic. Repeat with remaining 2 tortillas and filling. Chill until filling is firm, at least 1 hour or up to 4 hours.
Preheat oven to 400°F. Remove plastic; slice off unfilled ends. Cut rolls crosswise on slight diagonal into 3/4-inch-thick slices. Arrange on large baking sheet. Bake until heated through, about 7 minutes.

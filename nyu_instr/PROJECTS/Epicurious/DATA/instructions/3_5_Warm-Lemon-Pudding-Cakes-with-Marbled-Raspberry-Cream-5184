Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter six 3/4-cup soufflé dishes or custard cups. Place dishes in large roasting pan. Using electric mixer, beat 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar, 6 tablespoons butter and lemon peel in medium bowl until well blended. Add egg yolks 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in flour, then lemon juice. Gradually mix in milk (mixture will be thin and may look curdled).
Using clean dry beaters, beat egg whites in large bowl until soft peaks form. Add remaining 2 tablespoons sugar and beat until stiff but not dry. Fold whites into yolk mixture in 3 additions (mixture will be runny).
Divide pudding-cake mixture among prepared soufflé dishes. Pour enough hot water into roasting pan to come halfway up sides of dishes.
Bake pudding cakes until puffed and firm to touch, about 25 minutes. Transfer dishes to plates. (Can be prepared 8 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.) Sprinkle with powdered sugar. Top with dollop of Marbled Raspberry Cream.

In a large saucepan of salted boiling water cook shrimp 1 minute, or until just cooked through. Drain shrimp well and cool completely.
Chop shrimp and in a bowl toss with mayonnaise, celery, herbs, lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste. Make 4 sandwiches with shrimp salad, watercress sprigs, and bread, pressing together gently.

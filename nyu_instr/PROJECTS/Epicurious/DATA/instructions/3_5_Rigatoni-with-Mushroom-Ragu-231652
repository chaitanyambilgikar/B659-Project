Cook garlic in 1/4 cup oil in a wide 4- to 6-quart heavy pot over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until pale golden, about 1 minute. Add mushrooms, rosemary, sugar, salt, and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms are tender, 4 to 6 minutes (liquid will not have evaporated).
Force tomatoes with their juice through food mill (if using), adding to mushrooms in pot. Stir sauce and bring to a boil, then boil, stirring occasionally, until thickened, 15 to 20 minutes. Discard rosemary.
While sauce is boiling, cook pasta in a 6- to 8-quart pot of boiling salted water until al dente, then drain in a colander. Add pasta to sauce along with cheese and remaining tablespoon oil, then toss over moderate heat until well coated, about 1 minute. Serve immediately with additional cheese.

In a kettle cook the onion in the butter over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until it is softened, add the garlic, and cook the mixture for 1 minute. Stir in the wine, simmer the mixture for 2 minutes, and stir in the cream and the bread crumbs. Bring the cream mixture to a simmer, add the zucchini and the mussels, and steam the mixture, covered, for 3 minutes, or until the zucchini is crisp-tender and the mussels are opened. Discard any unopened mussels. Stir in the parsley and salt to taste, divide the mussel mixture between 2 soup plates, and serve it with the bread.

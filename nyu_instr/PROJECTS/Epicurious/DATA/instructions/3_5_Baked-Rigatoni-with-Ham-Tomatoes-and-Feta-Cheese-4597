Preheat oven to 375°F. Butter 13 x 9 x 2-inch glass baking dish. Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite. Drain. Place in prepared baking dish. Mix in ham, tomatoes, feta cheese, mozzarella cheese and thyme. Pour cream over. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and toss to blend. Cover with foil.
Bake pasta 15 minutes. Uncover and stir to coat pasta evenly with melted cheeses. Cover again. Bake until heated through, about 30 minutes longer.

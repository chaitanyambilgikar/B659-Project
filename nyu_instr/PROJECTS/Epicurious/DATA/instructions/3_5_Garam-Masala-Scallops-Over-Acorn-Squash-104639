Prepare squash: Preheat oven to 375°F.
Halve squash lengthwise, reserving 1 half for another use. Halve remaining squash piece diagonally crosswise and season with salt. Arrange wedges, cut sides up, in a small roasting pan filled with 1/2 inch water. Cover roasting pan tightly with foil and roast until tender, about 1 hour.
Prepare scallops after squash has been roasting 30 minutes: Pat scallops dry and season with salt. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 10-inch nonstick skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then brown scallops on both sides, 4 to 6 minutes total (scallops will be almost cooked through). Remove from heat. Add turmeric and toss until scallops are yellow, then transfer to a bowl.
Cook jalapeño, garlic, ginger, and 1 tablespoon lime juice in remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil in skillet over moderately high heat, stirring, 1 minute. Add water and simmer until water is evaporated and chile mixture is softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Add cream and garam masala and simmer 2 minutes. Remove from heat and cover.
When squash is tender, add remaining 2 teaspoons lime juice and scallops with any liquid that has accumulated in bowl to sauce and simmer until scallops are just cooked through and sauce is slightly thickened, about 2 minutes.
Put a squash wedge on each of 2 plates and spoon scallops and sauce over squash.

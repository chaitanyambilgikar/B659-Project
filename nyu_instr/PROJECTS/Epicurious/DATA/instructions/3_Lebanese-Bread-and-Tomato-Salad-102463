Preheat oven to 375°F.
Split pita loaves and toast on a baking sheet in middle of oven until golden, 10 to 15 minutes. Cool pitas on a rack and break into bite-size pieces.
While pitas are toasting, whisk together lemon juice, pomegranate molasses, and salt to taste in a serving bowl, then whisk in oil until emulsified.
Add pitas to dressing with remaining ingredients and toss to combine.

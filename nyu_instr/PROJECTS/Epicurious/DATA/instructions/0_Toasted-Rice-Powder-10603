In a dry small heavy skillet (not nonstick) toast rice over moderate heat, stirring, until deep golden, about 5 to 8 minutes, and transfer to a bowl to cool. In an electric coffee or spice grinder or in a blender grind rice to a powder. Sift powder through a fine sieve into a bowl. Powder keeps in a tightly sealed jar 1 month.

Heat oven to 350°F. Butter a 9" pie pan. In pan, mix cherries with 1 tablespoon sugar, juice and 1 tablespoon flour. In a food processor, pulse remaining 1/2 cup sugar, remaining 1/3 cup flour, pistachios, oats, walnuts, cardamom and salt until nuts are finely chopped, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in butter; sprinkle topping over cherries. Bake until juices bubble thickly and topping is browned, 25 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.

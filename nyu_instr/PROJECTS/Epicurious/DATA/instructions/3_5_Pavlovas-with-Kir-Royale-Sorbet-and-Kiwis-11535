Onto prepared baking sheet spread meringue with the back of a spoon into 3 1/2- to 4-inch rounds, making them slightly higher around the edges to form shells. Bake meringues in lower third of oven 1 hour, or until crisp on outside but soft in middle.
Peel parchment carefully form meringues and cool meringues on a rack. Meringues keep in an airtight container 1 day.

Preheat oven to 400°F. Line baking sheets with Silpat or parchment.
Sprinkle some cheese on a work surface and cover it with a puff pastry sheet. Then sprinkle more cheese evenly over pastry sheet and roll it out into a 10-inch square with a rolling pin. Fold in two opposite sides of the square so that the sides meet in the center. Fold in same sides of the pastry again to meet in center.
Fold one half of the pastry over the other. Cut pastry crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Dip cut sides of each piece in cheese and arrange, a cut side down, on lined baking sheet. Repeat with three remaining pastry sheets.
Bake palmiers in batches in middle of oven until golden on bottom, about 12 minutes. Turn over and bake until golden on bottom, 5 to 7 minutes more, then transfer to a rack to cool completely.

Drain oysters. Beat eggs in a medium bowl to blend. Add oysters and turn to coat completely. Pour half of saltine crumbs into a 13x9x2" baking dish. Working in batches, lift oysters with a slotted spoon, allowing excess egg to drain back into bowl, and transfer to baking dish. Scatter remaining crumbs over oysters and toss to coat. Cover dish and chill for 2-3 hours.
Line a plate with paper towels. Pour oil into a medium heavy skillet to a depth of 1/2". Prop deep-fry thermometer in skillet so bulb is submerged. Heat oil over medium heat to 375°F. Working in batches, fry oysters, turning once, until coating is crisp and deep golden brown, about 1 minute per batch. Transfer to paper towels; season with salt.

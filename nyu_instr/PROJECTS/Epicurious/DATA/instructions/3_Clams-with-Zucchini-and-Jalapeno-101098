Scrub clams well and in a large bowl cover with salted cold water. Cut zucchini into 2 x 1/2-inch sticks. Wearing rubber gloves, halve jalapeño lengthwise and discard seeds from one half. Finely chop jalapeño and onion. In a large saucepan heat 2 tablespoons butter over moderately high heat until foam subsides and sauté zucchini, jalapeño, and onion, stirring, until zucchini is crisp tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer zucchini mixture to a bowl.
In pan melt remaining tablespoon butter over moderately high heat and add clams and wine. Steam clams, covered, over moderately high heat 5 to 8 minutes, checking them every minute after 5 minutes and transferring them with tongs as they open to a serving bowl. Reserve cooking liquid in pan. (Discard clams that are unopened after 8 minutes.) Stir zucchini mixture into reserved cooking liquid and pour over clams.
Serve clams with bread.

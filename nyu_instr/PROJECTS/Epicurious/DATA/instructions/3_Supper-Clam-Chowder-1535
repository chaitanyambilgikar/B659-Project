Cook chopped bacon in heavy large saucepan over medium heat until fat is rendered and bacon begins to brown. Add onions and sauté until tender, about 10 minutes. Add potatoes and red bell pepper and sauté 1 minute. Add reserved liquid from canned clams, milk and bottled clam juice. Simmer chowder uncovered until vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes.
Add corn and clams to chowder; simmer until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Mix in 3 tablespoons chopped thyme. Season to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Bring to simmer before serving.) Ladle chowder into bowls. Garnish with additional thyme and serve.

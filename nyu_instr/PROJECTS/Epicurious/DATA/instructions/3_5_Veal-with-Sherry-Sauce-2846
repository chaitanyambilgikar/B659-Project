Melt 2 tablespoons butter with 2 tablespoons olive oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Season veal with salt and pepper. Dredge veal in flour, shaking off excess. Add veal to skillet in batches and sauté until golden brown and cooked through, about 1 minute per side. Transfer veal to platter. Cover with foil and keep warm.
Add broths, Sherry, lemon juice, garlic and Worcestershire sauce to same skillet. Bring to boil over high heat, scraping up any browned bits from skillet. Cook until sauce is reduced to 3/4 cup, about 10 minutes. Pour sauce over veal. Sprinkle with parsley and serve.

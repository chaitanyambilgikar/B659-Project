Stir together soy sauce, Sherry, cornstarch, sugar, and salt.
Heat a wok or deep heavy skillet over high heat until hot but not smoking, then stir-fry sausage 2 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to a plate.
Add garlic and ginger to fat remaining in wok and stir-fry until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
Add peas and stir-fry 1 minute. Return sausage to wok, then add water and boil, stirring occasionally, until peas are crisp-tender, 1 to 2 minutes.
Stir sauce again and add to peas along with scallions. Boil, stirring, until sauce is thickened and no longer cloudy, about 2 minutes. Season with pepper.

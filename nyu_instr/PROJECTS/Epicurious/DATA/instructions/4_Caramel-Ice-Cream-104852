Split vanilla bean in half lengthwise. Scrape seeds into large saucepan; add bean. Add sugar and 1/4 cup water and stir over medium-low heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat and boil without stirring until syrup turns deep amber color, occasionally brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush and swirling pan, about 8 minutes. Remove from heat. Add cream (mixture will bubble vigorously). Stir over low heat until any caramel bits dissolve, about 4 minutes. Add milk; bring to simmer. Whisk yolks in large bowl to blend. Gradually whisk caramel mixture into yolks. Return custard to saucepan and stir over medium-low heat until custard thickens and leaves path on spoon when finger is drawn across, about 5 minutes (do not boil). Strain custard into large bowl; refrigerate until cold.
Process custard in ice cream maker according to manufacturer’s instructions. Transfer ice cream to covered container and freeze until firm.

Make crust: Pulse flour, 10x sugar, cornstarch, and salt in food processor. Add butter, pulse until resembles cornmeal.
Press firmly into baking sheet about 1/4-inch thick. Refrigerate. Then bake until golden brown, approximately 20 minutes at 350°. Cut into rectangles while still warm and set aside to cool.
Make chocolate filling: Scald heavy cream, add chopped chocolate. Turn off heat and stir until smooth. Pour into baking sheet pan 1/4 to 1/2-inch thick and freeze.
Once frozen, cut into rectangles the same size as your crust rectangles. Keep frozen.
Make vanilla cream: Whip heavy cream. Add sugar and vanilla. Fold together with cheese. Set aside.
To assemble: Take two rectangles of pastry. Place one piece of frozen chocolate on one of them. Place both in the oven at 350°F for 15-20 minutes, until chocolate is warm and soft and crust is done baking.
Remove from the oven. Spoon some of the cheese and whipped cream mixture on top of the chocolate. Place the other piece of crust on top.
Drizzle with melted chocolate.

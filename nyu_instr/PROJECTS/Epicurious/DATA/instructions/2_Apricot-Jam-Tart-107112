Blend flour, sugar, lemon peel, baking powder, and salt in processor until combined. Add butter; using on/off turns, cut in until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add 2 eggs; using on/off turns, process until moist clumps form. Gather dough into ball. Flatten into disk. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate overnight. Let soften slightly before rolling out.
Preheat oven to 375°F. Butter 9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom. Set aside 1/3 of dough. Roll out remaining dough on lightly floured surface to 14-inch round. Transfer to prepared tart pan. Trim overhang to 1 inch. Fold in dough to make double-thick sides. Freeze crust 15 minutes. Sprinkle amaretti crumbs in crust. Spoon jam into crust, smoothing with spatula.
Roll out reserved dough to 11x6-inch rectangle. Cut into eight 1/2-inch-wide strips. Arrange strips atop jam to form lattice. Brush lattice with beaten egg.
Bake tart until crust is golden, about 45 minutes. Cool at least 6 hours to allow jam to set. Cut into wedges and serve.

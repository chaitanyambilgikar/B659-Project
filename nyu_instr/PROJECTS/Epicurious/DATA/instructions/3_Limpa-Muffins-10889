Preheat oven to 425°F. and butter twelve 1/3-cup muffin tins.
In a bowl whisk together flours, baking powder, salt, aniseed, and caraway seeds. In a small bowl whisk together milk, egg zest, butter, and molasses. Add milk mixture to flour mixture, stirring until just combined (do not overmix).
Divide batter evenly among muffin tins and bake in middle of oven 15 to 20 minutes, or until a tester comes out clean.

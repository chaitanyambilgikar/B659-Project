Preheat oven to 400°F. Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in heavy medium ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Add carrots, 5 unpeeled garlic cloves, and thyme. Sauté until carrots color, about 6 minutes; set aside. Arrange romaine, cut side up, in 15x10x2-inch baking dish. Add broth and 2 tablespoons olive oil; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cover with plastic wrap, then foil. Roast lettuce until tender, about 35 minutes. Uncover lettuce; roast until lightly browned, about 12 minutes.
At the same time, place skillet with carrots and garlic in oven alongside lettuce; roast carrots until golden and tender, about 40 minutes. Cut carrots lengthwise in half; set roasted carrots and garlic cloves aside. Drain and cool lettuce.
Meanwhile, combine beans, cilantro, bay leaf, cayenne, and 1/2 cup olive oil in saucepan. Cover; cook over medium-low heat until beans are tender, about 25 minutes. Discard bay leaf. Peel roasted garlic; add to beans. Mash until almost smooth. Season hummus with salt and pepper.
Heat 3 tablespoons vegetable oil in small skillet over medium heat. Add minced garlic; sauté until pale golden, about 3 minutes. Pour mixture into small bowl; whisk in lime juice and cumin.
Spread hummus on toast slices. Top each with 1 romaine half, folded to fit, 4 carrot halves, and 1 generous tablespoon dressing. Using vegetable peeler, shave Parmesan ribbons over each.

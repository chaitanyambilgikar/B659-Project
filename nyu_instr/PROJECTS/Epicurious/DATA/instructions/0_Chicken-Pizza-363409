Preheat the oven to 350°F.
Roll the pizza dough out and fit onto two 15-inch pizza pans. Drizzle 1 tablespoon of olive oil and 1 teaspoon of garlic on each pizza crust, followed by 1/2 cup each of the mozzarella cheese and 1/2 cup of the cheddar cheese. Scatter half of the bell pepper, sliced onion, chicken, and bacon on top of the cheeses.
Sprinkle another 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese and 1/2 cup cheddar cheese over each pizza and drizzle each pizza with 1 tablespoon more of olive oil. Bake the pizzas for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the crusts are lightly browned. Slice each pizza into 8 pieces.

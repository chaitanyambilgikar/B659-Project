Rinse rice well in a large sieve under cold running water, then transfer to a bowl. Add 2 cups cold water and let stand for 1 hour. Drain rice.
Heat clarified butter in a small skillet over moderate heat until hot but not smoking, then cook raisins and nuts, stirring, until golden, about 2 minutes.
Bring milk to a simmer in a 3- to 4-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat. Transfer 2 tablespoons milk to a cup, then add saffron and let stand. Add rice to remaining simmering milk and cook, stirring frequently, until rice is tender, about 10 minutes. Add sugar and simmer, stirring frequently, until mixture is thickened to a loose pudding consistency, about 35 minutes more. Stir in raisin-nut mixture, saffron milk, and cardamom and simmer 2 minutes more. Serve warm.

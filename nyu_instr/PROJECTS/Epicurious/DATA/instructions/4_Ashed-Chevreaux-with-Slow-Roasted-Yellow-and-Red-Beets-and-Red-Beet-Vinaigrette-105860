For the Beet Powder: 1/2 cup finely chopped beet (chopped in a food processor; or use the pulp left after juicing beets in a juicer)
Blot the beet pulp with paper towels to extract excess moisture. Line a microwave tray with a piece of parchment paper and spread the beets on it in a thin, even layer. Microwave on low power for 30 to 40 minutes, or until the beets are completely dried out but still maintain their color. Let the beets cool to room temperature. Grind the beets to a powder in a coffee or spice grinder. Store in a covered plastic container.
For the beet glaze: Heat the beet juice to a simmer in a small saucepan and cook until there are large bubbles forming at the top. Add the red wine vinegar and reduce until the liquid has a syrupy consistency. Pour into a small squeeze bottle.
Preheat the oven to 300º F.
Wrap the yellow beets and red beets separately in aluminum foil, adding 1 tablespoon of the canola oil to each. Roast for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, or until they are tender.
Peel the cooked beets. Cut the yellow beets into twelve 1/8-inch slices, then cut them with a cutter into 2-inch rounds. Cut the red beets into 36 batons about 1 inch long by 1/4 inch thick. Season all the beets with a little olive oil and salt.
To complete: Pipe some beet glaze in dots of decreasing size down one side of the plate. Place a round of yellow beet in the center of the plate. Top each with 6 red beet batons laid side by side and another slice of yellow beet. Lay a wedge of cheese over each slice.
Toss the beet greens with a little olive oil and salt. Stack a small pile of greens on each round wedge of cheese and sprinkle the plates with beet powder.

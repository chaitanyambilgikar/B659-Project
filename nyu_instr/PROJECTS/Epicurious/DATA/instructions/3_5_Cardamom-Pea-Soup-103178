Cook onion and ginger in butter in a 3- to 4-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until onion is softened. Add cardamom and cook, stirring, 30 seconds. Add broth and bring to a boil. Add peas and simmer, uncovered, until very tender, about 10 minutes. Purée soup in 3 batches in a blender until very smooth, at least 1 minute per batch (use caution when blending hot liquids). Return to pan, then season with salt and pepper and reheat.

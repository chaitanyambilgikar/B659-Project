Preheat oven to 325°F. Heat wok or heavy large skillet over high heat until very hot. Add first 4 ingredients and stir-fry until pork is brown and onion is tender, about 5 minutes. Mix in bok choy, red bell pepper and mushrooms and stir-fry until red bell pepper is just crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Add bean sprouts, sake, hoisin and soy sauce and stir-fry until bean sprouts are crisp-tender, about 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, wrap tortillas or crepes in foil. Place in oven to warm, about 8 minutes. Divide pork mixture among tortillas and roll up to enclose pork mixture. Serve immediately.

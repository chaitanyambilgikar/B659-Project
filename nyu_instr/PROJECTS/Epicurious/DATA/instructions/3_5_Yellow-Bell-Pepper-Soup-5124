Preheat oven to 400°F. Line 2 large baking sheets with heavy-duty foil. Toss bell peppers with oil in large bowl. Arrange in single layer on baking sheets. Roast until peppers are tender and beginning to brown, stirring occasionally, about 50 minutes.
Transfer peppers to heavy large saucepan. Add 4 1/2 cups broth. Boil 8 minutes to blend flavors. Cool slightly. Working in batches, puree mixture in blender. Return to saucepan. Mix in half and half and sugar. Thin soup with more broth if desired. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover; chill. Rewarm over medium heat before continuing.)
Spoon soup into bowls. Garnish with parsley sprigs and serve.

Bring stock to a bare simmer in a medium saucepan, then keep at a bare simmer.
Whisk together 2 tablespoons oil, lemon juice, scallion, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper in a medium bowl to make vinaigrette.
Cook leeks in 2 tablespoons oil in a 4-quart heavy pot over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until softened but not browned, 7 to 8 minutes. Transfer to a plate.
Add remaining tablespoon oil and rice to pot and cook, stirring constantly, until rice is coated evenly, about 1 minute. Add wine and briskly simmer, stirring, until most has been absorbed, about 1 minute.
Add 1 cup hot stock and briskly simmer, stirring constantly, until stock has been absorbed. Continue simmering and adding hot stock, 1 cup at a time, stirring constantly and allowing each addition to be absorbed before adding the next, until 1 cup stock is left, 15 to 18 minutes. Add peas, leeks, and remaining cup stock and cook, stirring, until rice is just tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in butter and cheese, then remove from heat.
When last cup of stock has been added to risotto, heat grill pan over high heat until hot. 3When risotto is done, season squid with 1/8 teaspoon salt and oil grill pan. Grill squid, pressing down with a spatula and turning halfway through, until opaque and just cooked through, about 1 minute total. Toss with enough lemon vinaigrette to coat.
Serve risotto topped with calamari and drizzled with any remaining lemon vinaigrette.

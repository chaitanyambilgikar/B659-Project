To Make The Waffles Preheat a waffle iron according to the manufacturer's directions. Preheat the oven to 200°F.
In a food processor, pulverize the pecans until finely ground. Add the eggs, butter, honey, vanilla, baking soda, and salt, and blend well.
Grease the waffle iron using a partially wrapped stick of cold butter. Hold the butter by its wrapped end and rub the other end all over the waffle iron's cooking surface. Add 1/4 cup batter and cook for a few minutes, until golden brown. Set right on the oven rack to crisp up and keep warm while you cook more.
To Prepare The Bananas Melt the butter with the oil in a sauté pan over medium heat. Add the bananas and cook for about 6 minutes, turning once, until golden brown. Set aside.
Mix the honey and cinnamon until well blended.
Place the waffles on warmed plates, top with the bananas, honey, and serve.

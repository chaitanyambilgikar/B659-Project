Make butter: In small bowl, combine raisins and 1/2 cup hot water. Cover and let soak 2 hours, then drain.
In food processor, combine butter, raisins, capers, and lemon zest and pulse until well combined. Stir in chives. Transfer to large sheet of wax paper and roll into 6-inch-long log. Wrap in wax paper and refrigerate at least 1 hour to allow flavors to develop.
Make salmon: Season salmon fillets with salt and pepper. In 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderately high heat, heat 1 tablespoon oil until hot but not smoking. Add 4 fillets, skin-sides-up, and sear until undersides are well browned, about 4 minutes. Turn fillets over and sear until just cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes more. Transfer to serving platter and keep warm. Wipe pan clean, heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil, and repeat with remaining 4 fillets.
Slice log of butter into 8 coins. Top each salmon fillet with 1 coin and serve immediately.

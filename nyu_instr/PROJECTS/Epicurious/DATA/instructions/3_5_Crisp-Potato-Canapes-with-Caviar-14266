In a 2-quart saucepan bring 1 quart salted water to a boil.
Cut potatoes crosswise into 1-inch-thick slices. Put slices flat on a cutting board and cut each slice into the largest possible rectangle, discarding excess. Halve each rectangle crosswise to form 2 cubes, each about 1 inch in size.
Simmer potatoes 5 minutes, or until just tender, and drain. Pat potatoes dry thoroughly. With a small melon-ball cutter or knife, scoop out an indentation about 1/3 inch deep in 1 side of each potato cube. Potatoes may be prepared up to this point 1 day ahead and chilled in an airtight container.
In a heavy saucepan heat 1 1/2 inches oil over moderate heat until a deep-fat thermometer registers 350°F. Fry potatoes until golden, 3 to 5, minutes, and transfer with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain. Potatoes may be fried 8 hours ahead and kept, covered loosely, at room temperature. Recrisp potatoes in a 375°F. oven 5 minutes.
Fell indentation in each potato cube with sour cream and top with caviar. Garnish canapés with chives.

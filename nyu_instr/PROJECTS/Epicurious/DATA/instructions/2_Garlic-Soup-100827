Separate garlic head into cloves. Smash cloves with flat side of a heavy knife and peel them. In a 2-quart saucepan bring water, garlic, bay leaf, and thyme to a boil and simmer, covered, 45 minutes.
Discard bay leaf and thyme sprigs and force mixture through a sieve into another saucepan. In a large bowl whisk together yolks, Parmesan, and 2 tablespoons oil until combined well. Add 1/2 cup hot garlic broth to yolk mixture in a slow stream, whisking, and whisk yolk mixture into remaining hot garlic broth. Cook soup over moderately low heat, whisking constantly, until slightly thickened and a thermometer registers 170°F. (do not let boil), about 10 minutes.
Tear bread into pieces and divide among 4 soup bowls. Ladle soup over bread and drizzle with remaining tablespoon oil.

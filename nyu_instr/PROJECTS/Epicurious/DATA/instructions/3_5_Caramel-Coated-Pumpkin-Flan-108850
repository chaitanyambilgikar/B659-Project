Preheat oven to 325°F. Combine 1 cup sugar and 1/3 cup water in small saucepan. Stir over medium-low heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat and bring to boil, brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush. Boil without stirring until syrup is deep amber color, occasionally brushing down sides and swirling pan, about 12 minutes. Immediately pour caramel into 7- to 8-cup soufflé dish (7 1/2x3 1/2 inches), tilting and rotating dish to coat bottom and 2 inches up sides thickly. Place dish in 13x9x2-inch metal baking pan.
Whisk pumpkin, condensed milk, sugar, and spices in large bowl to blend. Whisk in eggs and yolks, then cream and vanilla. Pour custard into prepared dish. Pour enough hot water into baking pan to come 1 1/2 inches up sides of dish.
Bake flan until deep brown on top and firmly set in center and blade of small sharp knife inserted into center comes out clean, about 2 hours 10 minutes. Remove flan from water; cool 1 hour. Refrigerate uncovered until very cold, at least 6 hours. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and keep refrigerated.)
Cut around flan to loosen. Place platter on flan dish. Holding platter and flan dish together, invert, allowing flan to settle onto platter. Scrape out any caramel syrup remaining in dish and drizzle over flan. Surround flan with frosted grapes. Cut flan into wedges; serve with grapes.

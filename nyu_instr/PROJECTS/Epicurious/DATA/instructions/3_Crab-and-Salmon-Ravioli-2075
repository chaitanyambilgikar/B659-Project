For Ravioli: Lightly sprinkle large baking sheet with flour. Bring medium saucepan of water to boil. Add carrot and ginger and blanch 1 minute. Drain and cool.
Remove any bones from salmon. Chop salmon coarsely. Transfer to processor. Add cream and egg white; puree. Transfer to bowl. Mix in carrot, ginger, crab, onion, celery, cilantro, lemon juice, salt and pepper. Place 1 gyoza wrapper on work surface. Place 1 level tablespoon filling in center. Brush edges with water. Cover with another gyoza wrapper and press firmly around edges to seal. Transfer to prepared sheet. Repeat with remaining gyoza wrappers and filling. (Can be made 8 hours ahead. Cover with plastic and chill.)
Bring large saucepan of water to boil. Add gyoza in batches and cook until tender, about 3 minutes per batch. Using slotted spoon, transfer gyoza to another baking sheet. Cover with foil.
Meanwhile Prepare Vinaigrette: Combine oil, vinegar and lemon juice in large skillet. Stir over medium heat until warm. Add tomatoes, snow peas and celery; stir just until heated through, 2 minutes. Add chives. Divide mixture among plates. Place ravioli atop vinaigrette.

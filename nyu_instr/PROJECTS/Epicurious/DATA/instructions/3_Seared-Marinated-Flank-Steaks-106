Cut steak in half crosswise. Using long sharp knife, split each steak in half, creating a total of 4 thin steaks. Combine wine, soy sauce, garlic, rosemary and thyme in 9x13-inch pan. Add steaks and turn to coat. Season generously with pepper. Cover and refrigerate 4 to 8 hours, turning occasionally.
Heat oil in heavy large skillet over high heat until almost smoking. Add 1 steak at a time and cook to desired doneness, about 2 minutes per side for medium-rare. Transfer to platter and let stand while cooking remaining steaks.

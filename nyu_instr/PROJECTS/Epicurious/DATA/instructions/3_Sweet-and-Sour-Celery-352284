Cut a round of parchment paper to fit just inside a wide heavy 6-to 8-quarts pot, then set round aside.
Simmer water, lemon juice, oil, honey, 3/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in pot, stirring, until honey has dissolved. Stir in celery (but not leaves) and cover with parchment round. Simmer until tender and liquid is reduced to about 1/4 cup, 35 to 40 minutes.
Meanwhile, coarsely chop reserved leaves.
Serve celery sprinkled with celery leaves and parsley.

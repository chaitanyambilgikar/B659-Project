In a large saucepan of boiling salted water cook the macaroni until it is tender and drain it very well (do not rinse it). Spread the macaroni out in a well-oiled jelly-roll pan and let it cool, tossing it to coat it with the oil in the pan. In a kettle fry the macaroni in batches in 1 inch of 350°F. vegetable oil for 2 minutes, or until it is pale golden, and transfer it with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain. In a small bowl combine well the curry powder, the salt, and the cayenne. In a bowl toss the macaroni with the sesame oil, add the curry mixture, and toss the mixture well.

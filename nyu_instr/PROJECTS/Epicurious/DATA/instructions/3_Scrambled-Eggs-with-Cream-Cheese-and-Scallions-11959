In a small non-stick skillet cook the scallions in the butter over moderately low heat, stirring, until they are soft. In a bowl whisk together the eggs, the cream cheese, and salt and pepper to taste, pour the egg mixture into the skillet, and cook the mixture over moderate heat, stirring, for 3 to 4 minutes, or until it is cooked through.

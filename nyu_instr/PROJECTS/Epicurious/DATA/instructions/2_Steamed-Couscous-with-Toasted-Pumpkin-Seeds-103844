Soak couscous in water to cover 10 minutes, then drain. Steam couscous in a steamer (lined with cheesecloth if holes are large) set over 1 inch simmering water, tightly covered, 20 minutes. Transfer couscous to a bowl and fluff with a fork. Pour 1 cup water over couscous and season with salt. Let stand, uncovered, 10 minutes.
While couscous stands, toast pumpkin and fennel seeds in oil in a skillet over moderate heat, stirring constantly, until pumpkin seeds are puffed and beginning to pop, 4 to 5 minutes. Season with salt.
Return couscous to steamer and steam, tightly covered, 20 minutes more. Transfer couscous to bowl and toss with pumpkin and fennel seeds.

Add gelatin mixture, stirring until dissolved, then cool 10 minutes. Purée in a food processor until smooth, then add yogurt and blend until combined. Freeze in ice cream maker.
Spread cookie crumbs evenly over bottom of an 8-inch springform pan. Spoon frozen yogurt gently over crumbs and carefully smooth top. Wrap pan in plastic wrap and freeze until yogurt is firm, at least 2 hours.

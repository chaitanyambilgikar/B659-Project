Preheat oven to 350° F. Sift 1/2 cup sugar and flour into medium bowl 3 times. Using electric mixer, beat egg whites, cream of tartar and salt in large bowl until soft peaks form. Gradually add remaining 1 cup sugar, beat until very stiff peaks form. Fold in flour mixture in 3 additions; fold in vanilla extract. Transfer batter to ungreased 10-inch-diameter by 4-inch-deep angel food cake pan.
Bake until cake is brown and crusty on top and tester inserted near center comes out clean, about 50 minutes. Turn pan upside down and fit center onto slender bottle neck. Cool cake completely. Cut around pan sides to loosen cake. Turn cake out onto platter. Cut into wedges. Serve with strawberries and Devonshire Cream.

Cover potato with cold water by 1 inch in a 2- to 3-quart saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, until potato is just tender, about 30 minutes. Drain, then cool on a plate at room temperature at least 4 hours, or chill, uncovered, in refrigerator overnight.
Put flour in a large bowl. Peel potato, then force it through food mill into flour. Add egg and 1/2 teaspoon salt and knead lightly in bowl until dough just comes together. Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth, about 1 minute. (Dough will have consistency of a soft cookie dough.)
Roll dough into a 12-inch log with your palms on a lightly floured surface and cut into 24 (1/2-inch) pieces. Roll each piece into a ball, then roll each ball into a 2-inch-long log with tapered ends and curl into a crescent. Transfer crescents to a plastic-wrap-lined baking sheet.
Bring 2 1/2 quarts water to a boil with 1 tablespoon salt in a 13- by 9- by 2 1/2-inch (3 1/2- to 4-quart) metal roasting pan, straddled across 2 burners. Add dumplings 1 at a time and, when first few dumplings rise to surface, reduce heat to a bare simmer and poach 5 minutes (do not let boil). Transfer dumplings with a slotted spoon to a large bowl of ice water and let stand 1 minute. Drain, then pat dry with paper towels.
Heat butter in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderate heat until foam subsides, then sauté dumplings, turning over once with a spatula, until golden brown, about 7 minutes total. Sprinkle with pepper, nutmeg, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt.

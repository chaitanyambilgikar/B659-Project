Bring first 3 ingredients to simmer in heavy small saucepan. Reduce heat to low. Add chocolate and stir until melted and smooth. Pour into medium bowl. Refrigerate until cool but not set, stirring occasionally, about 25 minutes.
Beat 3/4 cup chilled cream in another medium bowl to soft peaks. Add sugar and beat until stiff. Fold cream into white chocolate mixture.
Place scant 1/4 cup sliced berries in each of four 8- to 10-ounce wineglasses. Press 3 kiwi slices against sides of each glass. Spoon 1/3 cup cream mixture into each glass. Spoon scant 1/4 cup sliced berries in center of each, pressing into center so berries do not show at sides of glasses. Spoon remaining cream over; smooth tops. Cover and chill at least 2 and up to 6 hours.
To serve, using small knife, make lengthwise cuts in whole strawberries without cutting through stem ends. Fan 1 strawberry atop each dessert. Attach lime slice to rim of each glass.

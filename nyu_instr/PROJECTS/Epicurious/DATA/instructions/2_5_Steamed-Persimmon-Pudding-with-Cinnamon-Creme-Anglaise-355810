Butter and flour one 8-cup metal pudding mold with center tube and lid, then generously spray mold with nonstick spray. Butter, flour, and spray lid. Bring large kettle of water to boil. Place round cake rack in bottom of deep pot large enough to hold pudding mold. Whisk 1 1/2 cups flour and next 5 ingredients in medium bowl. Using electric mixer, beat sugar and butter in large bowl until fluffy. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Add flour mixture and beat until blended. Beat in persimmon puree and lemon juice.
Spoon batter into pudding mold; cover with lid. Place pudding mold on cake rack in pot. Add enough boiling water to come halfway up sides of mold. Return water to boil, cover pot, then reduce heat and simmer until top of pudding feels firm to touch and tester inserted near center comes out clean, adding more simmering water to pot to maintain water level, about 2 hours.

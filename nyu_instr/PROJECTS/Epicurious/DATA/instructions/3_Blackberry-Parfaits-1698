Whisk blackberry spread, 1 tablespoon amaretto and 1 teaspoon vanilla in small bowl until smooth.
Whisk sugar, flour, cornstarch, and salt in heavy medium saucepan to blend. Gradually whisk in milk. Whisk in egg. Add butter. Whisk over medium heat until mixture comes to boil and thickens, about 6 minutes. Boil 1 minute longer, whisking constantly. Remove from heat. Whisk in almond extract, 1 tablespoon amaretto and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla.
Spoon 1 teaspoon blackberry spread mixture into bottom of each four 1-cup stemmed glasses. Top each with 4 blackberries, then with about 3 tablespoons hot pudding. Repeat layering twice more. Divide any remaining blackberries among glasses. Refrigerate until cold, about 3 hours. (Blackberry parfaits can be prepared 1 day ahead. Keep refrigerated.)

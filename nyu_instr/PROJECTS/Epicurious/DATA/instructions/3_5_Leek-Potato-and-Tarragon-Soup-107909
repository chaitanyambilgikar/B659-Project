Melt butter in heavy large pot over medium heat. Add leeks, onion, garlic, and 2 tablespoons water. Cook until leeks are just golden, about 10 minutes. Add potatoes and broth; bring to boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 10 minutes. Mix in tarragon. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cool slightly. Cover and refrigerate. Rewarm before continuing.) Stir in cream and yogurt. Season soup to taste with salt and pepper.

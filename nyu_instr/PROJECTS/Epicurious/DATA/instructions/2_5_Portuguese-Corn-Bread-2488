Mix 1 cup cornmeal, pepper and salt in large bowl of electric mixer fitted with dough hook. Add 1 cup boiling water and mix until smooth. Let cool to 120°F., about 20 minutes. Mix in yeast and sugar, then 1/4 cup hot water and 1 tablespoon oil. Mix in remaining 1/2 cup cornmeal. Add 1 cup flour and mix until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes.
Cover bowl with damp towel and let dough rise in warm draft-free area until puffy, about 45 minutes.
Grease 9-inch metal pie pan with oil. Knead enough bread flour into dough to make it nonsticky. Knead on floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Knead into a ball. Place in pan. Flatten to fill bottom of pan. Cover with towel; let rise in warm draft-free area until doubled, about 50 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350°F. Score top of bread in ticktacktoe pattern. Bake until bread is light brown on top and sounds hollow when tapped on bottom, about 45 minutes. Remove from pan; cool on rack. Serve warm or at room temperature. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cool. Wrap tightly. Before serving, wrap in foil and warm in 350°F. oven 15 minutes.)

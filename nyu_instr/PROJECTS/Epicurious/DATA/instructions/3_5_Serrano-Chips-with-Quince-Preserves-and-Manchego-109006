Cut ham into 32 (3- by 2- by 2-inch) triangles. Heat 1/4 inch of oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderate heat until hot but not smoking, then fry ham in 4 batches, turning occasionally, until crisp and a shade darker, about 1 minute. Transfer to paper towels to drain.
Using a cheese plane or vegetable peeler, shave 32 small pieces of cheese from wedge. (Each piece should be about 1 inch square.) Top each ham chip with 1/8 teaspoon quince preserves, then press cheese squares into preserves.

Heat 1 tablespoon oil in heavy large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion, celery, garlic and bay leaf; sauté until onion is golden and tender, about 7 minutes. Add 3 1/4 cups broth, garbanzo beans, tomato paste and crushed red pepper. Bring to boil. Add macaroni; reduce heat to medium and boil gently until macaroni is very tender, adding more broth by 1/4 cupfuls if mixture is dry, about 15 minutes (mixture will be thick but some broth should remain). Season with salt and pepper. Discard bay leaf. Stir in parsley and 1 tablespoon oil.
Ladle pasta mixture into 4 bowls. Top each serving with 1 tablespoon freshly grated Parmesan cheese.

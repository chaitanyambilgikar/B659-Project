Heat 3 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and sauté until cooked through, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to plate; tent with foil to keep warm. Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil to drippings in skillet. Add sun-dried tomatoes, shallots and garlic. Reduce heat to medium and sauté until shallots are tender, about 5 minutes. Add cream and bring to boil, scraping up any browned bits. Mix any accumulated juices from chicken into sauce. Simmer until sauce thickens slightly, about 3 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer chicken to plates. Spoon sauce over and serve.

For cauliflower: Sauté bacon in heavy large skillet over medium heat until brown and crisp. Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towels to drain. Add cauliflower to drippings in skillet and sauté until crisp-tender and beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes, lemon juice, capers, and thyme; simmer 1 minute to blend flavors. Remove from heat.
For skate: Whisk rice flour, Cream of Wheat, and herbs in large shallow bowl to blend. Sprinkle fish with salt and pepper. Coat fish on both sides with flour mixture. Heat oil in another heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add fish. Sauté until brown and just opaque in center, about 3 minutes per side.
Rewarm cauliflower mixture over medium heat. Mix in bacon and croutons. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Spoon cauliflower mixture into center of 2 plates; top with fish.

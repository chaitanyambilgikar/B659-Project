Make crust Preheat the oven to 350°F.
Combine the graham cracker crumbs and the sugar. Slowly pour in the melted butter, then the egg whites, mixing to incorporate. Place approximately 3 ounces of the crust in each of 8 4-inch tart molds and press down with your fingertips until crust covers bottom and sides of molds. Bake for approximately 12 minutes just to set the shells. Remove from the oven and let cool.
Make chocolate cream Bring the milk and cream to a boil in a heavy-sided saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the chocolate and stir until smooth. Let cool until room temperature and whisk in the egg. Pour enough chocolate cream in each shell to reach just under the top of the edge. Place back in the oven and bake approximately 10 minutes or until chocolate is just set. Remove from the oven and let cool.
Make marshmallow Combine half of the water, half of the corn syrup, and all of the sugar in a heavy-sided saucepan and heat over medium-high heat until it reaches 240°F (measure with a candy thermometer). Combine the rest of the water and the powdered gelatin and place in a double boiler over medium heat. Cook, stirring until the gelatin is completely dissolved.
Combine the rest of the corn syrup and the vanilla extract in the bowl of a standing mixer with the whisk attachment. Turn to low speed and add the hot corn syrup mixture slowly until well combined. Turn the mixture up to medium high and whip for approximately one minute. Add the gelatin mixture and whip approximately 10 minutes or until the mixture becomes thick and foamy.
Place approximately 3 tablespoons of the marshmallow mixture on top of tarts, leaving a half-inch border around the edge. Place back in the oven for 12 minutes or until the marshmallow is slightly hard to the touch. Be careful not to overcook, as the marshmallow will begin to break down and deteriorate.
Remove and let cool. Serve on individual serving plates.

Preheat oven to 325°F.
Pulse 3 3/4 cups (1 1/4 pounds) almonds with sugar, zest, and baking powder in a food processor until finely ground. Add egg whites, honey, and marmalade and blend just until dough forms a ball (dough will be very sticky).
Roll tablespoons of dough into 1-inch balls and arrange about 1 inch apart on 2 parchment-paper–lined baking sheets. Flatten each ball into a 1 1/2-inch round with moistened fingers.
Gently press a whole almond into center of each cookie. Bake in middle of oven until tops of cookies are light brown, about 20 minutes, then cool on baking sheets on racks.
Dust with confectioners sugar.

Simmer cobs in clam juice in a large pot over medium heat for 5 minutes. Remove cobs and set liquid aside. Put oil in the same pot and cook leeks and celery on low for 15 minutes. Stir in garlic, clam-and-cob liquid, milk, potatoes, and cayenne. Simmer 5 minutes; add corn kernels and scallops. Whisk together half-and-half and flour to form a smooth slurry; add to pot. Cook for 5 minutes. Salt. Heat oven to 350°F. Coat a baking sheet with cooking spray; lay prosciutto on sheet and bake 10 minutes. Crumble into soup. Garnish with herbs.

Melt 2 tablespoons butter in large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add shallots; sauté 5 minutes. Add wine, bay leaf and 1 tablespoon thyme; boil until mixture is reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Add beets and 4 cups stock; bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, until beets are tender and liquid is reduced to 1 cup, about 50 minutes.
Place salmon on rimmed baking sheet. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in small saucepan; brush over salmon. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Mix panko, horseradish and 1 tablespoon thyme in small bowl.

Preheat oven to 475°F. Bake salmon just until cooked through and top is golden brown, about 8 minutes.

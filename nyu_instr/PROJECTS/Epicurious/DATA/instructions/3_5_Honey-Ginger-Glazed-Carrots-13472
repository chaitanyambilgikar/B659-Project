In a kettle cover carrots with salted water by 2 inches and boil, uncovered, until tender, about 10 minutes.
While carrots are cooking, cook honey, butter, and gingerroot over moderate heat, stirring, until butter is melted.
Drain carrots well and in a bowl toss with honey glaze and salt and pepper to taste.

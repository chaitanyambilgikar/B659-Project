Preheat oven to 350°F. Arrange game hens, breast side up, in 13x9x2-inch metal baking pan. Brush hens with butter and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Bake uncovered 25 minutes.
Meanwhile, whisk crushed pineapple, maple syrup, lemon juice, mustard and soy sauce in medium saucepan to combine. Baste hens with some of pineapple mixture. Continue roasting until meat thermometer inserted into thickest part of thigh registers 180°F, basting occasionally with more pineapple mixture, about 45 minutes.
Transfer roasted game hens to serving platter. Tent with aluminum foil to keep warm. Scrape pan juices into remaining pineapple mixture. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until pineapple sauce is reduced to 2/3 cup, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes. Sprinkle hens with chopped fresh parsley. Serve hens warm, passing pineapple sauce separately.

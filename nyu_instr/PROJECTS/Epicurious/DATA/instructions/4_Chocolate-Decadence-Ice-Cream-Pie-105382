Make crust: Preheat oven to 325°F. Butter 9-inch-diameter metal pie pan or glass pie dish. Mix cookie crumbs and melted butter in bowl until crumbs are evenly moistened. Press crumb mixture firmly onto bottom and up sides of prepared pan. Bake until crust is set, about 10 minutes. Cool completely.
Make bittersweet chocolate sauce: Combine cream, butter, and corn syrup in medium saucepan. Bring to simmer. Remove from heat. Add bittersweet chocolate; let stand 1 minute. Whisk until melted and smooth. Stir in vanilla. Let stand at room temperature until cool and slightly thickened, about 20 minutes.
Place alternate scoops of chocolate-chocolate chip ice cream, chocolate fudge brownie ice cream, and cookies-and-cream ice cream in single layer in cooled crust. Drizzle 1/2 cup chocolate sauce over ice cream. Freeze pie until sauce sets, about 10 minutes. Top pie with scoops of remaining ice cream, alternating flavors and mounding in center. Drizzle 1/3 cup sauce over. Freeze pie until firm, at least 2 hours. (Can be prepared 5 days ahead. Cover tightly and keep frozen. Cover and refrigerate remaining chocolate sauce.)
Stir white chocolate in top of double boiler set over barely simmering water just until melted and smooth. Using small spoon, drizzle white chocolate in thin lines over ice cream pie. Freeze until white chocolate is firm, about 10 minutes. Stir bittersweet chocolate sauce over low heat just until warm. Serve pie with warm chocolate sauce.

Stir together cheese, mayonnaise, onion, and cayenne.
Cut out 4 rounds from each bread slice using cutter and arrange on a baking sheet. Bake toasts until tops are crisp and just golden, 3 to 4 minutes. Cool toasts slightly on baking sheet on a rack. (Leave oven on.)
Top each toast with a rounded 1/2 teaspoon cheese mixture, spreading to edge with a small offset spatula or knife. Bake toasts until topping is puffed and golden, about 6 minutes.

Bring the bouillon to a boil in a medium-small saucepan. Add the carrots, and lower the heat to a simmer. Cook for 5 minutes, or until the carrots are just tender, then add the zucchini, optional summer squash, and corn. Simmer for another 5 minutes, or until all the vegetables are perfectly tender.
Stir in the peas, tofu, and cooked pasta, and simmer for just a couple of minutes longer. Serve hot or very warm in small bowls with small spoons.

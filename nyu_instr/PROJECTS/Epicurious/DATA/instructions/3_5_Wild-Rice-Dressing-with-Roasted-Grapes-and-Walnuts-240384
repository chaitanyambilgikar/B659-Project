Melt butter in heavy large saucepan over medium heat. Add shallots and celery. Cook until soft, stirring frequently, about 8 minutes. Add wild rice, 4 1/2 cups broth, thyme, and 1/2 teaspoon coarse salt; bring to simmer. Cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer 30 minutes. Add brown rice, cover, and simmer until rice is tender but firm, adding more broth by 1/4 cupfuls if dry, about 40 minutes longer. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Cool slightly; cover and chill. Rewarm over medium-low heat before using, adding more broth by 1/4 cupfuls if dry.
Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350°F. Place grapes on rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle with oil; toss. Roast grapes until beginning to wrinkle, about 15 minutes. Transfer to bowl; toss with vinegar. DO AHEAD: Can be made 4 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.
Add grapes and any juices, walnuts, and orange peel to hot rice; toss well. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Make the croutons: In a baking pan toss the bread cubes with the oil, the pepper, and the salt and toast them in the middle of a preheated 350°F. oven, tossing them occasionally, for 15 minutes, or until they are golden. The croutons may be made 2 days in advance, cooled, and kept in an airtight container.
Make the pan roast: In a saucepan cook the shallot in the butter over moderately low heat, stirring occasionally, until it is softened, stir in the flour, the tomatoes, the basil, the Tabasco, and the paprika, and cook the mixture, stirring, for 8 minutes. Add the reserved oyster liquor, strained through a fine sieve to remove any grit, stir in the half-and-half and the milk, and heat the mixture over moderately low heat, stirring and being careful not to let it boil, until it is hot. Add the oysters and salt to taste and heat the pan roast until it is hot, being careful not to let it boil.
Divide the pan roast among 6 shallow bowls and garnish it with the croutons and the parsley.

Place eggplant pieces in large colander set over bowl. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon salt. Let stand 1 hour. Pat eggplant dry with paper towels; set aside. Char peppers over gas flame or in broiler until blackened on all sides. Enclose in paper bag 10 minutes. Peel and seed peppers; cut into 1/2-inch-wide strips and set aside.
Heat 6 tablespoons oil in heavy large pot over medium heat. Add onions and sauté until light golden, about 10 minutes. Mix in garlic. Add eggplant, zucchini, tomatoes, half of parsley, bay leaves, 1 teaspoon pepper, honey, and cumin. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes. Add bell peppers; cook uncovered 10 minutes longer, stirring occasionally. (Can be made 6 hours ahead. Chill. Rewarm before continuing.)
Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in small saucepan over low heat. Add anchovies, oregano, and remaining parsley; stir 1 minute. Add to vegetable mixture. Stir in olives. Season with salt and pepper. Serve warm or at room temperature.

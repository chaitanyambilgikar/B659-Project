First: Prepare the Spicy Asian Marinade as directed in the recipe. Put the chicken breasts in a bowl, pour in the Spicy Asian Marinade, and toss lightly to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for an hour, or longer if possible.
Second: Prepare a medium-hot fire for grilling or preheat a gas grill or the broiler. If grilling, brush the rack with olive oil and place the meat 3 inches from the source of the heat. Grill, covered, 5 to 7 minutes per side, or until the chicken is opaque all the way through. Alternatively, you can heat a nonstick skillet until very hot over high heat and sear the chicken until done, about 8 to 10 minutes, turning once. Remove from the heat and cool slightly. Cut the chicken meat across the grain into thin slices. Serve with a vegetable and rice or noodles. or use in salads or stir-fried dishes.

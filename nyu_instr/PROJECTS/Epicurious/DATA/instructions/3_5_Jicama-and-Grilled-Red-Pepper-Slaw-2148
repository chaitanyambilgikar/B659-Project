Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Place smoke chips in 8x6-inch foil packet with open top. Set packet atop coals about 5 minutes before grilling. Brush green onions with 1 1/2 tablespoons oil. Grill until lightly browned, turning often, about 4 minutes. Cut onions into 1/4-inch pieces. Place in large bowl. Grill peppers until lightly charred, turning often, about 10 minutes. Enclose in paper bag; let stand 10 minutes. Peel and seed peppers; cut into 1/4-inch-wide strips. Add to onions.
Whisk orange juice, lime juice, honey, cumin and 3 tablespoons oil in small bowl. (Vegetables and dressing can be made 8 hours ahead. Cover separately and refrigerate.) Add jicama and dressing to grilled vegetables; toss to coat. Season with salt and pepper.

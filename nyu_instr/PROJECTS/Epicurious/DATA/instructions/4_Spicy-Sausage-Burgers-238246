1. Combine the chuck, sirloin, sausage meat, and salt and pepper in a bowl. Using your hands, mix well. Form into 6 patties. Refrigerate until ready to grill.
2. Prepare a charcoal or gas grill: Lightly spray the grill rack with vegetable oil cooking spray. Light the coals or heating elements, and let them burn or heat until hot.
3. Grill the burgers for about 5 minutes. Turn and grill for 4 to 6 minutes longer for medium-well burgers. Be sure the burgers reach 155°F so that the pork is thoroughly cooked.

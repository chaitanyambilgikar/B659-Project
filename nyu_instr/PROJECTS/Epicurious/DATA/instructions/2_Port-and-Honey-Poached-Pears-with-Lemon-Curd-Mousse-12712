In a large heavy saucepan simmer the wine, the Port, and the water with the sugar, the honey, the zest, and the cloves, stirring, until the sugar is dissolved and add the pears, peeled, halved, and cored. Simmer the pears, covered, turning them occasionally, for 10 to 15 minutes, or until they are tender, transfer them and the zest with a slotted spoon to a shallow bowl or serving dish, and boil the poaching liquid until it is reduced to about 1 1/2 cups. Let the poaching liquid cool, pour it over the pears, and chill the mixture, covered, until it is cold. The poached pears may be made 2 days in advance and kept covered and chilled. Serve the poached pears with the lemon curd mousse.

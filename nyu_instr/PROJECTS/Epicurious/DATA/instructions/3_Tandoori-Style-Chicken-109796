Mix first 7 ingredients in small bowl to blend. Using sharp knife, cut three 3/4-inch-deep diagonal slashes in each chicken piece. Divide chicken between 2 large bowls and rub with spice mixture. Let stand 10 minutes. Divide yogurt and onions between same bowls. Toss chicken to coat. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
Preheat oven to 500°F. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with foil; place cooling racks on prepared baking sheets. Using slotted spoon, transfer chicken thighs to 1 sheet and chicken breasts to second sheet, spacing pieces slightly apart (make sure that chicken pieces do not touch and are covered in yogurt mixture). Bake until chicken is cooked through, about 30 minutes for breasts and about 40 minutes for thighs. (Chicken can be made 1 day ahead. Refrigerate until cold, then cover and keep refrigerated.) Place chicken on large platter. Serve cold or at room temperature.

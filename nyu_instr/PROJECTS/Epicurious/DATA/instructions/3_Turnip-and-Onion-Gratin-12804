In a bowl toss the turnips and the onion with the cornstarch, 1/4 cup of the Parmesan and salt and pepper to taste and transfer the mixture to a buttered 9-inch-square baking dish, patting it down. Drizzle the cream evenly over the mixture, sprinkle the mixture with the remaining 1 tablespoon Parmesan, and bake the gratin in the middle of a preheated 375°F. oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the top is golden.

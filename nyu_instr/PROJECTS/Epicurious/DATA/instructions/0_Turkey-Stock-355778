Heat oil in heavy large pot over high heat. Working in batches, add turkey parts and sauté until deep brown, about 15 minutes per batch. Return turkey parts to pot. Add vegetables and 18 cups water. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer stock 3 hours. Strain into large bowl. If necessary, return stock to same pot and cook until reduced to 4 cups stock (not including layer of fat). Cool stock slightly. Chill uncovered until cold, then cover and keep chilled up to 4 days. Remove and reserve fat layer on top before using.

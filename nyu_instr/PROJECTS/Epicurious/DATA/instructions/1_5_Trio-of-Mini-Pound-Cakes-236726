Make batter Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter 9 (4-ounce) disposable mini loaf pans. (If using nondisposable metal pans, butter them, then line with parchment paper and butter paper.)
In medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt. In large bowl, using electric mixer fitted with whisk attachment, beat butter at high speed until creamy, about 3 minutes. Add sugar and beat until mixture is light and somewhat fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well at low speed after each addition, then beat in vanilla. Add 1/3 of flour mixture and beat at low speed until not quite combined, about 30 seconds. Add 1/3 of milk and and beat at low speed until not quite combined, about 30 seconds. Repeat with remaining flour mixture and milk, adding in 2 more batches of each. Beat at low speed just until smooth.
Pour 1/3 of batter into medium bowl. Gently stir in poppy seed-lemon juice mixture and lemon zest. Divide among 3 of prepared pans.
Pour 1/2 of remaining batter into medium bowl. Gently fold in chocolate chip-flour mixture and mashed banana. Divide among 3 of prepared pans.
Divide remaining vanilla batter among remaining 3 prepared pans.
Place all pans on large baking sheet. Bake until cakes are puffed and firm to touch and tester inserted into the center comes out with few crumbs attached, about 30 to 40 minutes. Cook on rack.
When cool, wrap each cake in plastic wrap, then parchment or wax paper. Label, stack in groups of 3 (1 of each kind), and tie together with ribbon or twine.

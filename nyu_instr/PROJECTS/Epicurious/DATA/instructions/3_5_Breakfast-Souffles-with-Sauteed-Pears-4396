Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter six 2/3-cup soufflé dishes or custard cups. Melt 6 tablespoons butter in large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in 6 tablespoons sugar. Add pears and sauté until tender and golden, about 5 minutes. (Can be prepared 2 hours ahead. Cover and let stand at room temperature.)
Using electric mixer, beat cream cheese, egg yolks and vanilla in large bowl until light and fluffy. Sift flour and cornstarch into cream cheese mixture. Stir just until blended (do not overmix).
Beat egg whites in another large bowl until foamy. Add cream of tartar and beat until firm peaks form. Add remaining 1/3 cup sugar; beat egg whites until glossy. Stir 1 cup of egg whites into cream cheese mixture to lighten. Using rubber spatula, gently fold in remaining whites. Divide among prepared dishes.
Bake soufflés until just set and slightly brown on top, about 25 minutes. Rewarm pears over medium-low heat. Remove soufflés from oven. Run tip of small knife around sides of soufflés to loosen. Using oven mitts for protection, turn soufflés out onto plates. Serve warm with sautéed pears.

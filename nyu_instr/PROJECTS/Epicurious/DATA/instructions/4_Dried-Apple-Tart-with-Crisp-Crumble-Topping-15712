Make filling: In a heavy 5-quart kettle simmer filling ingredients with a pinch salt, covered, until apples are fully plumped, about 15 minutes. Uncover mixture and simmer, stirring occasionally, until thick and any excess liquid is evaporated or absorbed, about 1 hour. (Reduce heat as liquid is evaporated or absorbed and stir mixture frequently toward end of cooking to prevent scorching.) Discard cinnamon sticks. Filling may be made 2 days ahead and cooled before being chilled, covered.
Make topping: Cut butter into 1/2-inch pieces. In a food processor pulse butter, flour, and granulated sugar until crumbly. Transfer topping to a bowl and chill, covered, until ready to use.
Make pastry dough when filling and topping are done: Preheat oven to 375°F.
Cut butter into 1/2-inch pieces. In cleaned food processor pulse together pastry dough ingredients and a pinch salt until mixture begins to gather together.
Press dough evenly onto bottom and up side of an 11-inch tart pan with a removable fluted rim. Line shell with foil and bake in middle of oven until shell is set, about 12 minutes. Gently remove foil (if foil sticks to shell, leave foil on and bake about 2 minutes more) and bake shell until edge is golden, about 5 minutes (tart shell will not be completely cooked).
Immediately spoon filling into shell and crumble topping evenly over filling. Bake tart in middle of oven 30 minutes, or until topping is golden. Cool tart in pan on a rack. Tart may be made 1 day ahead and kept, covered and chilled, in pan. Reheat tart, uncovered, if desired or bring to room temperature before serving. Remove side of pan.
Serve tart with whipped cream or ice cream.

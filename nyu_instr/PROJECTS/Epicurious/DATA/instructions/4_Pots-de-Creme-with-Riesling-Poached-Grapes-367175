Bring wine, grapes, and 4 tablespoons sugar to a boil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring to dissolve sugar. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until mixture measures 2 cups, about 1 hour; chill.
Preheat oven to 325°F. Using an electric mixer, beat yolks, 6 tablespoons sugar, and salt in a large bowl until pale yellow, about 2 minutes.
Bring cream to a simmer in a medium saucepan over medium heat; gradually whisk into yolk mixture. Whisk in milk and sour cream. Pour through a fine-mesh sieve set over a medium pitcher. Divide among ramekins; cover each with foil and place in a large roasting pan. Add enough hot water to pan to come halfway up sides of ramekins.
Bake pots de crème until just set in center, about 1 hour. Uncover and chill until cold, about 3 hours. Spoon grapes over.

1. Place the beans in a large pot and cover them with cold water. Cover pot, bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat, then remove from the heat and let sit for 1 hour. Drain and reserve.
2. Place the shallots and 3 tablespoons of the butter in a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat and cook, stirring, until the butter is melted and the shallots have begun to sizzle. Continue to cook, stirring often, until the shallots begin to turn translucent, about five minutes. Add the pre-cooked beans, stir, then cover with the water. Increase the heat to medium high. When the water boils, reduce the heat again so the water is simmering very gently. Cover, and cook until the beans are soft and some are beginning to fall apart, 1 1/2 hours. Season with salt to taste, and keep warm.
3. Heat a cast-iron skillet over medium heat until it is hot but not smoking. Add the ham slices and cook until they are golden on each side, about 4 minutes per side.
4. Stir the remaining butter into the beans, adjust the seasoning, and divide them among four plates. Lay a slice of ham next to the beans, and serve, with the peppermill alongside.

Preheat oven to 450°F.
Toss vegetables with oil, salt, and pepper in a bowl, then spread in an oiled large shallow (1-inch-deep) baking pan. Roast vegetables in middle of oven, stirring occasionally, until tender, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool in pan on a rack, then coarsely mash with a potato masher and stir in basil.

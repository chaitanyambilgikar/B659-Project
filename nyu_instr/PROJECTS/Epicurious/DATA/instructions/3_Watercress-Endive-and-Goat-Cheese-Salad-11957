In a small bowl toss the bread cubes with 1 tablespoon of the oil and salt to taste and on a baking sheet toast them in the middle of preheated 350°F. oven for 10 minutes, or until they are golden. Transfer the croutons to a salad bowl and let them cool. In another small bowl whisk together the lemon juice, the mustard, the thyme, and salt and pepper to taste, add the remaining oil in a stream, whisking, and whisk the dressing until it is emulsified. To the croutons add the watercress, the endive, the goat cheese, and the dressing and toss the salad well.

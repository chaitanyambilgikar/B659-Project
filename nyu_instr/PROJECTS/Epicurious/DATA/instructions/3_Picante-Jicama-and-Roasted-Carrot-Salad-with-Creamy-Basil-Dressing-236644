Preheat oven to 350° F. Spray large rimmed baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray. Spread carrots on sheet, then very lightly spray carrots. Roast until tender, 30 to 40 minutes. Let cool.
In dry skillet over moderate heat, toast pine nuts, stirring constantly, until fragrant and light golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Immediately transfer to plate and let cool.
In small bowl, toss jicama with lemon or lime juice, chile powder, and cayenne, if using.
To serve, divide mixed baby greens among 4 salad plates and top each with 4 carrots. Mound 1/3 cup jicama atop each portion. Sprinkle each salad with 2 tablespoons pine nuts and garnish each plate with 2 endive, radicchio, or red-leaf lettuce leaves; 2 orange slices; and 2 fig halves, if using. Drizzle 1 tablespoon basil dressing over each salad and serve immediately.

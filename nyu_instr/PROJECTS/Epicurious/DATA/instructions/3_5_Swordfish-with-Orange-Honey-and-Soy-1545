Combine orange juice, honey, soy sauce, lemon juice, garlic powder and ginger in 8x8x2-inch glass baking dish and stir. Add fish and turn to coat. Let marinate at room temperature 1 hour, turning occasionally.
Preheat broiler. Remove fish from marinade; place on broiler rack. Transfer marinade to small saucepan and boil 1 minute. Broil fish until just opaque in center, basting occasionally with marinade, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer fish to plates and serve with rice.

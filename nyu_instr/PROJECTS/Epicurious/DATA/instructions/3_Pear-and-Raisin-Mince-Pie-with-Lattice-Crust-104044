For crust: Blend flour, salt and sugar in processor. Add butter; using on/off turns, process until butter is cut into 1/4-inch pieces. Add 6 tablespoons ice water. Using on/off turns, blend until dough comes together, adding more water by tablespoonfuls if dough is dry. Gather into ball; divide into 2 pieces. Flatten pieces into disks; wrap in plastic. Chill at least 30 minutes and up to 1 day.
For filling: Mix first 7 ingredients in bowl. Mix in pears and cornstarch. Position rack in center of oven; preheat to 400°F. Roll out 1 dough disk on lightly floured surface to 13- to 14-inch round. Transfer to 9-inch-diameter glass pie dish; spoon in filling. Roll out second dough disk to 12-inch round; using ruler as aid, cut dough into 3/4-inch-wide strips. Lay strips over filling, spacing 3/4 inch apart. Lay additional strips at right angle to first strips, forming lattice. Trim overhang to 3/4 inch. Fold dough edge and strip ends under; crimp to seal. Brush dough strips (not edge) with yolk mixture.
Bake pie until crust is golden and pears are tender, about 50 minutes; cool.

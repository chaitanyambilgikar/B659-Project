Pat salmon dry and with a sharp knife cut into roughly 1/3-inch cubes. In a medium bowl lightly beat egg and gently stir in salmon and remaining ingredients until just combined.
Heat a 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderate heat and, working in batches, drop 2-tablespoon measures of salmon mixture about 1 inch apart into skillet. Cook cakes until undersides are golden, about 1 minute. Turn cakes over and cook until just cooked through, about 1 minute more. Transfer cakes as cooked to a platter. Salmon cakes may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered. Bring cakes to room temperature before serving.
Garnish cakes with lime wedges and serve with dipping sauce.

Preheat broiler. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil. Toss lemon, shallots, sugar, and 1/4 cup oil in a large bowl to coat. Season with salt and pepper. Spread mixture out evenly on prepared sheet; set bowl aside.
Broil lemon-shallot mixture until beginning to char in spots, 8-10 minutes. Turn lemon rounds and shallot slices over and broil until almost completely charred, 6 minutes, watching closely (once they begin to char, they can darken very quickly; discard any burnt lemon or shallot). Let cool.
Coarsely chop mixture. Place in reserved bowl and stir in vinegar, chives, Dijon mustard, and remaining 1/2 cup oil. Season with salt and pepper. DO AHEAD: Chutney can be made 5 days ahead. Cover and chill. Bring to room temperature before serving.

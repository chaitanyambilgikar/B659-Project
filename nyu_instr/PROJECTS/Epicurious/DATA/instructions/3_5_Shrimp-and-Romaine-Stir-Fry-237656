Make sauce: Stir together all sauce ingredients in a small bowl.
Make stir-fry: Heat oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then stir-fry garlic and ginger until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add shrimp and stir-fry until almost cooked through, about 3 minutes. Add half of romaine and stir-fry until it begins to wilt, then add remaining romaine and stir-fry until just wilted and shrimp are just cooked through, about 1 minute. Stir sauce, then add to stir-fry and simmer, stirring, 2 minutes.

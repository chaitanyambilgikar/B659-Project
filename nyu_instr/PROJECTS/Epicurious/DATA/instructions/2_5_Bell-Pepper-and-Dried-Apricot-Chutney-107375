Bring all ingredients to a boil in a nonreactive 2-quart saucepan, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, until chutney is thickened but still saucy, about 50 minutes. Cool chutney, uncovered, then chill, covered, stirring occasionally, at least 2 hours (to allow flavors to develop) and up to 1 week.

If using Spanish chorizo, finely chop, then cook in oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderate heat, stirring, until browned, 4 to 5 minutes. If using Mexican chorizo, remove from casings and cook (without oil) in skillet, stirring and breaking up meat, until bubbling and completely separated, 4 to 5 minutes.
Whisk eggs together in a bowl and stir into chorizo. Cook, stirring, until eggs are scrambled and just set, about 5 minutes. Serve immediately.
* Available at Latino markets.

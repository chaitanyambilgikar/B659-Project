Remove any bones from salmon and discard. Place salmon in bowl or shallow casserole. Cover with teriyaki sauce. Marinate for 5 minutes
Meanwhile, trim roots from scallions. Trim 2 bunches of scallions so that each scallion has only 1 inch of green on top. Place trimmed scallions in nonstick skillet with enough salted water to cover. Bring to a boil, lower heat, and cook until scallions are soft, about 5 minutes. Keep warm.
Remove salmon from marinade. Reserve marinade. Press 1/2 teaspoon of butcher-grind black pepper into skinless side of each salmon fillet. Heat 1 very large or 2 smaller nonstick skillets until very hot. Put salmon skin side up in pan(s) and cook over medium-high heat for 3 minutes. Turn over and cook 2 more minutes.
Meanwhile, finely dice remaining scallions so that you have 1/2 cup. Add to reserved marinade. Add marinade and 1/4 cup water to salmon. Heat for 1 to 2 minutes, until salmon is cooked as desired. Serve immediately with boiled scallions.

Preheat oven to 500°F. and heat a baking sheet in lower third of oven 5 minutes.
Fold each sheet of foil in half crosswise to crease, and then unfold.
On a plate coat red snapper fillets with oil and sprinkle with pepper and salt to taste. On each sheet of foil put 1 fillet to one side of crease and sprinkle with 2 teaspoon lemon juice, 1/4 teaspoon thyme, and half of any oil remaining on plate. Top each fillet with 3 lemon slices.
Working with 1 foil package (papillote) at a time, fold left half of foil over fillet. Starting at 1 corner of crease, fold edge of foil over in triangles, following a semicircular oath around fillet (each fold should overlap previous one), smoothing out folds as you go and tucking last ford under, until papillote is completely sealed. Put papillotes on hot baking sheet and bake in middle of oven 5 minutes.
Serve papillotes with couscous.

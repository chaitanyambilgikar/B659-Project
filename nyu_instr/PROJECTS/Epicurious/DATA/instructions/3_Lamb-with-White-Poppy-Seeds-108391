Pour 1/2 cup hot water over posto in a small bowl and let stand.
Melt butter in a 4- to 6-quart heavy pot over moderate heat, then cook cardamom, cinnamon, and bay leaves, stirring, until cardamom starts to pop, about 1 minute. Stir in onions, ginger, and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are pale golden, about 15 minutes.
Add lamb, salt, and 1 tablespoon sugar and cook, stirring occasionally, until meat is lightly browned, about 4 minutes. Add chiles, posto (with soaking liquid), and enough hot water (1 to 2 cups) to just cover lamb and simmer, covered, over low heat until lamb is very tender, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.
Season with salt to taste and enough sugar for stew to taste slightly sweet (up to 1 tablespoon). Boil until most of excess liquid is reduced and lamb is coated with thickened sauce, 15 to 25 minutes. Do not eat bay leaves.

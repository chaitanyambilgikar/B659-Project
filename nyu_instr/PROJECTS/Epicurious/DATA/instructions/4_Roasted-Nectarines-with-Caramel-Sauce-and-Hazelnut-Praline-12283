Preheat the oven to 375°F. Put 8 of the nectarine halves, cut sides down, in a glass baking dish just large enough to hold them in one layer and roast them in the oven for 20 minutes, or until they are softened. While the nectarines are roasting, chop the remaining 2 nectarines halves, in a non-stick skillet cook them over moderate heat, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes, or until they are very soft, and in a blender or food processor purée them.
In a heavy saucepan melt 3/4 cup of the sugar over moderate heat, stirring with a fork, and cook the syrup, swirling the pan occasionally, until it is a golden caramel. Working carefully and quickly, stir in the cream, the nectarine purée, and the lemon juice, stirring until the sauce is combined well. Keep the caramel sauce warm.
Line an 8-inch cake pan with foil and in it spread the hazelnuts in one layer. In another heavy saucepan melt the remaining 1/2 cup sugar over moderate heat, stirring with a fork, and cook the syrup, swirling the pan occasionally, until it is a golden caramel. Working quickly, pour the hot caramel over the hazelnuts. Let the hazelnuts praline cool completely and chop it into small pieces.
Put 2 roasted nectarine halves, cut sides up, in each of 4 compotes and top each serving with about 2 tablespoons of the caramel sauce and 1 tablespoon of the praline. Garnish each serving with some of the raspberries and some of the mint sprigs and serve the remaining caramel sauce and praline separately.
To toast and skin the hazelnuts: Toast the hazelnuts in one layer in a baking pan in a reheated 350°F. oven for 10 to 15 minutes, or until they are colored lightly and the skins blister. Wrap the nuts in a kitchen towel and let them steam for 1 minute. Rub the nuts in the towel to remove as much of the skins as possible and let them cool.

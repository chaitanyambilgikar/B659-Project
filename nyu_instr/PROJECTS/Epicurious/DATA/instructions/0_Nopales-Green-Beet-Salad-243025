Place the beets in a small saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil and cook over medium heat until tender, about 45 to 60 minutes. Remove pan from the heat and let stand 15 minutes. Drain, peel and cut beets into thin wedges while still warm. Dress lightly with white wine vinegar and flavored oil; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Set aside.
Preheat oven to 450°F. Place oven racks at the middle and highest positions.

Toss the cactus strips with the oil, salt and pepper, and place them on two foil0lined baking sheets in even layers. With one tray on each rack, roast for 20 to 25 minutes, switching the trays halfway through, until the edges of the strips are crisp and the color is drab green. The strips will have shrunken slightly and will be dry.
In a medium bowl, combine the nopal strips, beets and red onion. Drizzle with Marjoram Vinaigrette and let stand for 15 minutes to combine flavors. Serve at room temperature or chilled.

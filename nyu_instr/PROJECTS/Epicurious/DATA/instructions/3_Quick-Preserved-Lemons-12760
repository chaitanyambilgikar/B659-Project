In a baking dish just large enough to hold the lemons in one layer toss the lemons with the salt, pour enough of the lemon juice over them to just cover them, and bake the lemons, covered, in a preheated 200°F. oven, stirring occasionally, for 3 hours. Let the lemons cool and transfer them with their brine to an airtight container. The preserved lemons keep, covered and chilled, indefinitely.

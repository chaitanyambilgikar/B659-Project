In a steamer set over boiling water steam the zucchini, covered, for 10 minutes, or until it is very tender. In a blender pureé the zucchini with the avocado, halved, peeled, and chopped, the buttermilk, 3/4 cup of the ice cubes, the lemon juice, and the cumin, adding enough of the additional ice cubes to reach the desired consistency. Divide the soup between 2 bowls and sprinkle it with the chives. Makes about 2 1/4 cups, serving 2.

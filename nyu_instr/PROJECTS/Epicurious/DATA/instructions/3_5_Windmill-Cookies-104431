Stir together baking soda and water until baking soda is dissolved.
Beat together butter, brown sugar, and baking soda mixture with an electric mixer until pale and fluffy.
Whisk together flour, salt, and spices, then mix into butter mixture until combined well. Stir in almonds. Form dough into 3 (10- by 3-inch) logs and wrap tightly in plastic wrap. Freeze logs until firm, about 4 hours, or overnight.
Preheat oven to 350°F.
Keeping remaining logs frozen, cut 1 log crosswise into slices slightly less than 1/4 inch thick and arrange slices 1 inch apart on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake in middle of oven until set, 12 to 14 minutes, then transfer to racks to cool. Slice and bake remaining dough in same manner.

Simmer blueberries, 3/4 cup sugar, and water in a 1 1/2- to 2-quart heavy saucepan, stirring occasionally, until blueberries burst and collapse, 3 to 5 minutes. Purée with lime juice in a blender until smooth. (Use caution when blending hot liquids.) Blend in sugar to taste. Pour into molds and freeze until slushy, about 45 minutes. Insert sticks and continue to freeze until completely hardened, at least 3 hours and up to 1 week.

Preheat oven to 450°F. Butter and flour six 4 1/2-inch-diameter tartlet pans with removable bottoms. Open crusts on floured work surface. Sprinkle each with 1 teaspoon flour. Press out cracks. Cut out six 5 1/2-inch rounds, using bowl or plate as guide. Transfer to prepared tartlet pans. Trim edges. Pierce all over with fork. Bake until light brown, piercing with fork after 5 minutes if bubbles form, about 10 minutes. Transfer to racks.
Reduce oven temperature to 400°F. Combine sugar and corn syrup in heavy medium saucepan. Stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Simmer 3 minutes. Remove from heat. Add butter and spices and stir until butter melts. Whisk eggs and vanilla in medium bowl. Gradually whisk in hot syrup.
Place 2 tablespoons raisins in each tart. Divide syrup mixture among tarts. Bake until filling browns and puffs and top appears dry, about 20 minutes. Transfer racks; cool. Remove tarts from pans. Serve with frozen yogurt.

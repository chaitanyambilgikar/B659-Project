Place beans in large bowl. Pour enough water over beans to cover by 3 inches. Let stand overnight. Drain. Transfer beans to large pot; add turkey wings. Add enough water to pot to cover beans and turkey wings by 1 inch. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until beans are just tender, about 45 minutes. Drain, reserving cooking liquid and bean-turkey mixture separately. Cut meat from turkey wings and coarsely chop; discard skin and bones.
Preheat oven to 350°F. Heat oil in heavy large ovenproof pot over medium heat. Add onions and sauté until golden, about 10 minutes. Add jalapeño and garlic; sauté 1 minute. Stir in ketchup, brown sugar, mustard, and Worcestershire sauce, then beans and turkey. Add enough reserved bean cooking liquid (about 2 cups; reserve remaining cooking liquid) to pot to almost cover beans. Bring to boil. Transfer pot to oven. Bake uncovered until beans are very tender and liquid thickens, about 45 minutes. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cool slightly. Chill until cold, then cover and keep chilled. Before serving, bring to simmer, adding more reserved cooking liquid to moisten, if desired.)

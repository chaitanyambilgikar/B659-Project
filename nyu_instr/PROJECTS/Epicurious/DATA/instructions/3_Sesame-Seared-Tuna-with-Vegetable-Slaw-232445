For slaw and dressing: Attach grating blade to food processor. Julienne each vegetable and set aside. In another bowl, mix all dressing ingredients and add vegetables. Add cilantro and combine gently. Let rest for at least 30 minutes.
For tuna: Place a large nonstick pan over high heat until hot. Combine sesame seeds and wasabi in a bowl; season with salt and pepper. Coat pan with cooking spray; drizzle oil in pan. Lightly salt tuna; dredge in sesame-wasabi mixture. Reduce heat to medium and place tuna in pan. Sear until lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Flip; cook 2 minutes more. Remove from heat and let rest for a few minutes. Divide slaw among 4 plates and top with tuna.

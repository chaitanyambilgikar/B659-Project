Preheat oven to 375°F. and generously butter twenty-four 1/8-cup muffin tins (about 1 1/2 inches across top and 3/4 inch deep).
In a metal bowl set over a pan of barely simmering water melt chocolate and butter, whisking until smooth. Remove bowl from heat and whisk in granulated sugar and vanilla. Add flour and salt,whisking until just combined, and whisk in eggs, 1 at a time,whisking well after each addition.
Fill each tin about three-fourths full with batter and sprinkle about 1 teaspoon chips over each cake.
Bake cakes in middle of oven 12 to 15 minutes, or until a tester comes out with crumbs adhering to it. Turn cakes out onto a rack and cool. Cakes may be made 4 days ahead and kept in an airtight container at room temperature. Sift confectioners' sugar over cakes.

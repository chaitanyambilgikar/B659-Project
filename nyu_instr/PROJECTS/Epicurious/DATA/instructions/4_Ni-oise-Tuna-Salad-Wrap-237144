Gently break apart tuna in a bowl. Add salad dressing, tomatoes and olives. Put 1/4 tuna mixture, 1/4 greens and 1/4 of egg slices on each tortilla. Tightly fold first third of tortilla over mixture, fold in ends and continue to roll over tightly. Slice in half and serve. Place toothpick into each section or place seam-side down to prevent unwrapping. Serve each wrap with 5 chips.

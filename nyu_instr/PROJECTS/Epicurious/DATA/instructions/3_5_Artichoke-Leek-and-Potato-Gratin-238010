Preheat oven to 425°F. Butter 9- by 13-inch glass baking dish or 14-inch oval gratin dish.
In medium saucepan over moderately high heat, combine leeks, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, and 2/3 cup water. Cover, bring to boil, then reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 8 minutes. Drain, transfer leeks to medium bowl, and let cool.
Using food processor slicing disk or mandoline, thinly slice potatoes, then transfer to large bowl and add cold water to cover. Stir with hands to rinse, drain well, and repeat. Layer potatoes between paper towels and pat dry.
Add Swiss cheese, artichokes, pepper, and remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt to leeks and toss well.
Layer 1/3 of potatoes in bottom of prepared dish, overlapping slightly. Evenly spoon 1/2 of leek-cheese mixture over top. Top with second layer of potatoes, then remaining leek-cheese mixture, then final layer of potatoes. Slowly pour half-and-half over top. Cover snugly with foil.
Bake 40 minutes. Remove foil, sprinkle Parmesan cheese over top, and bake until top is golden and potatoes are easily pierced with small knife, about 20 minutes more. Serve warm.

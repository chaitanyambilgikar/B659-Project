Break 2 sheets of matzo into 1/2" pieces; place in a medium bowl. Cover with very hot tap water. Let stand for about 30 seconds, then drain. Beat 2 large eggs in another medium bowl; season with salt and pepper. Add drained matzo; mix until combined and a wet batter forms. Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Spoon scant 1/4-cupfuls of batter into skillet, making 4 pancakes. Fry, turning once, until golden and just cooked through, about 1 minute per side. Serve with jam, syrup, or whatever the hell you'd like. These rock.

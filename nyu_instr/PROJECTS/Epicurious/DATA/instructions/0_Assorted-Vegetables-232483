Cover potatoes with salted cold water by 1 inch in a 4-quart pot and boil, uncovered, until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain in a colander and halve if large.
While potatoes boil, steam asparagus in a steamer set over boiling water, covered, until crisp-tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to a bowl of ice and cold water to stop cooking, then pat dry.
Steam sugar snaps in steamer set over boiling water, covered, until crisp-tender, about 1 minute. Transfer with slotted spoon to ice water to stop cooking, then pat dry.
Preheat broiler.
Cut cauliflower into large florets (about 3 inches long and 2 inches wide), then cut florets lengthwise through stem into flat 1/2-inch-wide slices. Gently toss with oil and salt to taste in a bowl and arrange in 1 layer on a broiler pan. Broil 3 inches from heat, turning over once, until cauliflower is crisp-tender and edges are brown, about 5 minutes total.
Arrange cooked vegetables (warm or at room temperature), bell peppers, and tomatoes separately or mixed on 1 or 2 platters and serve with dips: anchovy mayonnaise, cilantro chutney, and romesco sauce.

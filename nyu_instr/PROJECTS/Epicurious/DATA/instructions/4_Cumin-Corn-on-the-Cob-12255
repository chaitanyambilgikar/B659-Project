In a kettle combine corn with enough cold water to cover. Bring water to a boil and remove kettle immediately from heat. Corn may be cooked 30 minutes ahead and kept warm in the cooking water. Drain corn well and transfer to a platter. Drizzle corn with oil and sprinkle with cumin, salt, and pepper.

Rinse porcini under running water; place in bowl. Bring broth to boil in medium saucepan. Pour over porcini. Let stand until soft, about 30 minutes.
Melt 1 tablespoon butter in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add spinach and stir until wilted, about 3 minutes. Arrange spinach in bottom of 13x9x2-inch glass baking dish.
Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in heavy medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onion and sauté until tender, about 5 minutes. Add flour, stir 1 minute. Gradually whisk in mushrooms with their soaking liquid and cream. Boil until sauce thickens, whisking constantly, about 3 minutes. Mix in turkey. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Preheat oven to 400°F. Crack eggs open over spinach, spacing evenly. Spoon turkey mixture around eggs, leaving yolks exposed. Sprinkle Parmesan over. Bake until eggs are just set, about 15 minutes. Serve with toasted bread.

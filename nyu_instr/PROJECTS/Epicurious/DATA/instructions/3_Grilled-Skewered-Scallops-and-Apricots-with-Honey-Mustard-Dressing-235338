Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Whisk first 4 ingredients in medium bowl. Season dressing with salt and pepper. Transfer 1/4 cup dressing to another medium bowl; set aside for salad.
Alternately thread 4 apricot quarters and 3 scallop halves onto each skewer; brush generously with remaining dressing. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill until scallops are just opaque in center, occasionally brushing with more dressing, about 3 minutes per side.
Add lettuce to bowl with reserved dressing and toss to coat. Divide salad among 4 plates. Top each with 2 scallop skewers; brush with any remaining dressing and serve.

Bring chicken broth to simmer in medium saucepan. Add peas and cook just until tender, about 2 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer peas to bowl. Add 2 tablespoons butter and saffron threads to broth and bring to boil. Remove from heat. Add couscous; stir to blend. Cover tightly and let stand until liquid is absorbed and couscous is tender, about 5 minutes. Fluff couscous with fork. Gently mix in chives and peas. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer couscous to large bowl.

Soak the cracked wheat in cold water. Drain and dry. Chop the onions very fine and blend with the ground lamb, the wheat and the seasonings. Pound and knead the mixture thoroughly. You may put it through the meat grinder, if you wish, and knead it again, adding a little ice water as you work. It should become a paste.
Form into small balls and serve raw with cocktails. Or form into small round patties, with a chip of ice in the center of each. Brush the patties well with oil and broil.

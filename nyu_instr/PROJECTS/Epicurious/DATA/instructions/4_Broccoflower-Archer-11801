In a large skillet cook garlic and red pepper flakes in oil over moderate heat, stirring, 1 minute. Add broccoflower and sauté over moderately high heat, stirring frequently, until it begins to brown, about 2 minutes. Add water and cook, covered, 5 minutes, or until broccoflower is just tender. Add vinegar, butter, and salt and pepper to taste and gently toss until butter is melted. Transfer mixture to a serving bowl and sprinkle with basil and Parmesan.

Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment. Punch down dough; divide into 12 equal pieces.
Working with 1 piece at a time and keeping remaining dough covered with a kitchen towel, roll dough on a lightly floured surface into a 17"- long rope. Form rope into a U shape. Lift top of left end; fold over or under opposite side; press together gently about two-thirds down from the top of right side. Lift right end up, fold over, and press in or tuck under, forming a pretzel shape. Repeat with remaining dough. Divide pretzels between sheets, spacing about 2" apart. Loosely cover with plastic wrap or a kitchen towel. Let dough rise in a warm, draft-free area until slightly puffed but not doubled in size, 30-45 minutes.
Meanwhile, arrange racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 375°F. Beat egg white and 2 teaspoons warm water in a small bowl. Brush each pretzel all over with egg wash, then sprinkle each with 1/2 tablespoon pearl sugar.
Bake for 10 minutes; rotate baking sheets and continue baking until pretzels are golden, 6-8 minutes longer. Let pretzels cool on a wire rack.
Serve warm or at room temperature.

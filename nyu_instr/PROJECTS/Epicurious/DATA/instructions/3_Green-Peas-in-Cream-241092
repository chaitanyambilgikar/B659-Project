Bring a large heavy saucepan of salted water (4 teaspoons salt for 2 quarts water) to a rolling boil, then slowly add peas so water maintains a boil. Stir in sugar and cook peas, uncovered, until tender, 5 to 12 minutes, depending on size of peas.
Drain peas in a colander.
Boil cream in saucepan until reduced by half, 2 to 3 minutes. Add butter, peas, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and salt to taste and cook over medium heat, stirring, until butter is melted and peas are warmed through. Stir in chervil.

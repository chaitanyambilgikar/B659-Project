Marinate olives: Stir together all olive ingredients in an airtight container and marinate olives, chilled, at least 8 hours. Bring to room temperature before using.
Make pita toasts: Preheat oven to 350°F.
Brush rough sides of pita halves with oil and sprinkle with za'atar. Cut each round into 8 wedges, then halve each wedge diagonally. Arrange triangles, oiled sides up, on 2 baking sheets and bake in batches in middle of oven until crisp and pale golden, about 10 minutes. Cool on a rack.
Assemble salad: Add lemon juice to marinated olives, then close container and shake vigorously. Divide olive mixture between 2 large salad bowls. Divide romaine, cucumber, tomatoes, feta, and pita toasts between bowls, then sprinkle with za'atar and toss.

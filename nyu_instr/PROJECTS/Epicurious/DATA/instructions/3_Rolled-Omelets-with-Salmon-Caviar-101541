In a bowl beat the eggs well with 1/3 cup water and the salt.
Heat a 6- to 7-inch non-stick skillet over moderate heat until it is hot and brush it lightly with the oil. Half fill a 1/4-cup measure with the egg mixture, pour the mixture into the skillet, and tilt and rotate the skillet to coat the bottom.
Cook the egg sheet for 10 seconds, or until it is just set, beginning with the side closest to the handle and tilting the skillet away from you, roll it up using a rubber spatula, and keep the roll in the skillet at the side opposite the handle.
Brush the skillet with more oil if necessary, half fill the 1/4-cup measure with the egg mixture, and pour in the mixture. Tilt the skillet so that the mixture coats the bottom and flows under the egg roll, cook the egg sheet for 10 seconds, or until it is just set, and roll the egg roll back over the egg sheet, forming a thicker egg roll.
Half fill the 1/4-cup measure with the egg mixture and pour the mixture into the skillet. Tilt the skillet so that the mixture coats the bottom and flows under the egg roll, cook the egg sheet for 10 seconds, or until it is just set, and roll the egg roll back over the egg sheet in the same manner.
Turn the egg roll out onto a sheet of wax paper and let it cool. Make egg rolls with the remaining egg mixture in the same manner. There should be at least 4 rolls. (The egg rolls may be made up to 1 day ahead and kept covered and chilled. Let the rolls come to room temperature before assembling the hors d'oeuvres.)
With a sharp knife trim the ends of the rolls diagonally and cut the rolls diagonally into 3/4-inch pieces. Turn the rolls cut side up and top each roll with a dollop of the sour cream and a small spoonful of the caviar. Arrange the hors d'oeuvres decoratively on a platter.

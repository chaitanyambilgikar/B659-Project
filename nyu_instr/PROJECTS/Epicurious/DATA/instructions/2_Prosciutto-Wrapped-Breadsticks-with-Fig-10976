Make the fig spread: In a small saucepan simmer the figs in the Port and the water with the sugar, covered, for 20 minutes and simmer the mixture, uncovered, until the liquid is reduced to about 1 tablespoon. In a food processor (preferably small) purée the fig mixture with the mustard and the lemon juice and transfer the spread to a small bowl. The fig spread may be made 1 week in advance, kept covered and chilled, and allowed to return to room temperature.
Working with 1 prosciutto slice at a time, spread one side of each slice with 1/2 teaspoon of the fig spread, fold the slice lengthwise into a thin strip, and wrap it in a spiral around 1 of the breadsticks. The breadsticks should be wrapped no more than 30 minutes in advance.

In wok or large sauté pan over moderately high heat, heat 1 tablespoon oil until hot but not smoking. Add 1/3 of garlic, 1/3 of ginger, and 1/3 of white parts of scallions and sauté until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add 1/3 of bok choy and sear until tips have wilted and stalks are crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper, then transfer to large serving dish and cover with foil to keep warm.
Repeat process 2 more times for a total of 3 batches. Garnish with green parts of scallions and serve immediately.

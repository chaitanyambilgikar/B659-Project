Crush the olives lightly with the flat side of a large knife on a cutting board and discard the pits. Drain the olives on paper towels and chop them. In a large bowl stir together the flour, the baking powder, the sugar, the salt, and the mint, add the olives, and toss the mixture well. In a small bowl whisk together the eggs, the oil, the onion, and the milk and add the egg mixture to the flour mixture, stirring until the batter is just combined. Transfer the batter to a greased loaf pan, 8 by 4 by 2 1/2 inches, and bake the bread in the middle of a preheated 350°F. oven for 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until a tester comes out clean. Turn the bread out onto a rack and let it cool.

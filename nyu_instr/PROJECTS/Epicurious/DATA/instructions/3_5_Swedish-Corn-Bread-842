Preheat oven to 400°F. Butter 13x9x2-inch glass baking dish. Beat sugar and butter in large bowl until blended. Add eggs and beat until well blended. Beat in 2 cups water and cornmeal. Sift flour, baking powder and salt into small bowl. Add to cornmeal mixture; stir just until blended. Transfer batter to prepared pan.
Bake until bread is golden brown and tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Transfer dish to rack and cool corn bread slightly. Serve warm or at room temperature. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cool bread completely. Cover with foil and store at room temperature.)

Cut tentacles from octopus heads (just below eyes) and discard heads. In 5-quart heavy pot, combine tentacles and enough water to cover by two inches. Add pickling spice, salt, pepper flakes, and 1/2 cup lemon juice, and bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, until octopus is tender, about 40 minutes. Remove from heat, let rest 5 minutes, then drain. Refrigerate tentacles until chilled, then cut into 3-inch pieces. In large bowl, toss with remaining lemon juice and kosher salt to taste.

Heat oil in a 10-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat until hot but not smoking. Add carrots and saut, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes. Add pomegranate juice, cinnamon stick, salt, and pepper and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until carrots are tender and liquid is reduced to a glaze, 20 to 25 minutes. Add coriander seeds and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Discard cinnamon stick and serve carrots hot or at room temperature.

Cook tomatillos in large pot of boiling salted water until olive-green color, about 5 minutes. Drain and transfer to blender. Add onion, jalapeño, and garlic and process tomatillo sauce until smooth.
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in skillet over medium heat. Add sauce and bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer until slightly thickened, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Stir in cilantro. Season with salt and pepper. Cool to room temperature. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Chill. Bring to room temperature before using.)
Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Toss shrimp with remaining 2 tablespoons oil in large bowl. Add ground chili, onion powder, and garlic powder; toss to combine. Sprinkle shrimp with salt and pepper. Grill shrimp until just cooked through, about 2 minutes per side.
Spoon about 3 tablespoons tomatillo sauce into center of each of 6 plates. Arrange shrimp atop sauce. Sprinkle with queso fresco.
* Tomatillos (green tomato-like vegetables with paper-thin husks), ground New Mexican chilies, and queso fresco (also known as queso blanco) are available at Latin American markets and some supermarkets.

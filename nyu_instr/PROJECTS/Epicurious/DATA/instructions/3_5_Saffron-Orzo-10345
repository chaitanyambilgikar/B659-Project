In a saucepan bring the broth and 1 1/2 cups water to a boil, add the orzo, and boil it for 5 to 7 minutes, or until it is al dente. In a small bowl dissolve the saffron and 1 tablespoon of the hot cooking liquid. Drain the orzo well, return it to the pan, and stir in the saffron mixture, the butter, the Parmesan, and salt and pepper to taste.

Place potatoes in a saucepan with salted water to cover. Bring to a boil and cook until tender, about 20 to 30 minutes. Drain and cool potatoes, then peel and cut into thin wedges. Meanwhile, cook green beans in a small saucepan of boiling salted water until tender but crisp, about 5 to 7 minutes. Pour into a strainer, run under cold water and then pat dry. For the salad dressing, combine garlic, mustard, basil and lemon juice in a small bowl. Whisk in oil a little at a time until well mixed, and season with salt and pepper. In a large bowl, combine chicken, potatoes, green beans, carrots, red pepper, onion, olives, capers and fresh herbs. Toss with dressing. Garnish with egg and tomato wedges. If desired, serve on lettuce-lined plates.

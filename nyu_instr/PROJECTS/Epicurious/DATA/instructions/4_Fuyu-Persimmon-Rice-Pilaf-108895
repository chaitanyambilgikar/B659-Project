Cook shallot in oil in a 1 1/2- to 2-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until golden, 2 to 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low, then add rice, ginger, and cinnamon and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add broth and water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and cook, covered, until rice is tender, about 20 minutes. Remove pan from heat and let stand, covered, 5 minutes.
Fluff rice with a fork and stir in persimmons, cilantro, lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste. Serve warm.

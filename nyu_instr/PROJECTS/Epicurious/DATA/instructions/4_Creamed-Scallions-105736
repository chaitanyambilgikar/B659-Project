Bring cream and garlic to a boil in a medium skillet. Lower heat and simmer briskly until reduced by half, about 7 minutes. Remove from heat.
While cream is reducing, cook scallions with water, covered, in a heavy medium saucepan over moderately high heat until tender, 5 to 7 minutes.
Add cream mixture to scallions. Stir in parsley and salt and pepper to taste, then cook over moderate heat, stirring, until piping hot.

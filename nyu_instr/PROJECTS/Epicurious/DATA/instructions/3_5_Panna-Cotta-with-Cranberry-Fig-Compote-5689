Place 1/2 cup milk in small bowl; sprinkle unflavored gelatin over. Let stand 10 minutes to soften gelatin.
Combine cream, remaining 1/2 cup milk and sugar in heavy large saucepan. Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add bean. Bring mixture to boil. Remove from heat. Add gelatin mixture; whisk until gelatin dissolves. Cool to room temperature, whisking occasionally. Discard vanilla bean.
Divide cream mixture among 8 shallow soup bowls. Refrigerate until set, at least 4 hours. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and keep refrigerated.) Spoon Cranberry-Fig Compote atop panna cotta and serve.

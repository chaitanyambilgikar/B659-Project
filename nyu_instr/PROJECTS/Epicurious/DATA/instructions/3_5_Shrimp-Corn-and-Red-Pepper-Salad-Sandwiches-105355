Cook corn in pot of boiling salted water 3 minutes. Drain; cool. Cut kernels off cob. Place corn kernels in medium bowl. Add shrimp, bell pepper, cilantro, green onion, lime juice, lime peel, and hot pepper sauce; toss to blend. Mix in mayonnaise. Season salad with salt and pepper. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Chill.)
Pull some bread out of each roll half, hollowing out slightly. Divide salad among rolls and serve.

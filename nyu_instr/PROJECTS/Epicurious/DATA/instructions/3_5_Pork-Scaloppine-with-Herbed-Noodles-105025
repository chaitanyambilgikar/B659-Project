Gently pound each piece of pork between 2 sheets of plastic wrap to 1/4-inch thickness with flat side of a meat pounder or a rolling pin. Pat dry and season with salt and pepper.
Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons butter in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until foam subsides, then, without crowding, sauté half of pork, turning over once, until golden brown, about 4 minutes total. Transfer with tongs to a plate and keep warm, covered. Sauté remaining pork with 1 1/2 tablespoons butter in same manner. Reserve skillet with fat.
While meat is sautéing, cook noodles in a large pot of boiling salted water until just tender, then drain in a colander. Return to pot and toss with remaining 2 tablespoons butter, herbs, and salt and pepper to taste.
Add vermouth and capers to skillet and deglaze by boiling, scraping up brown bits. Continue to boil until sauce is slightly thickened, about 1 minute.
Divide noodles among 4 plates and top with pork. Spoon sauce over pork.

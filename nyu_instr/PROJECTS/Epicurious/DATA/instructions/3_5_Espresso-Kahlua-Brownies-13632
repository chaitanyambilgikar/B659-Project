Preheat oven to 350°F. and butter and flour a 9-inch square baking pan, knocking out excess flour.
In a small heavy saucepan melt butter and chocolate over low heat, stirring, until smooth. Cool chocolate mixture to lukewarm.
In a large bowl with an electric mixer beat together eggs, sugar, vanilla, espresso powder, and Kahlúa until mixture is thickened and pale. Beat in chocolate mixture. Into a bowl sift together flour, baking powder, and salt and beat into batter just until blended well.
Spread batter evenly in pan and arrange coffee beans in 5 rows of
5 beans each. Bake brownies in middle of oven 30 to 35 minutes, or until a tester comes out with crumbs adhering to it. Cool brownies completely in pan on a rack before cutting into 25 squares. Brownies keep, layered between sheets of wax paper in an airtight container at cool room temperature, 5 days.

Make sweet potatoes: Preheat oven to 400°F. Cook sweet potatoes in large pot of boiling water until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain; transfer potatoes to large bowl and add butter. Using electric mixer, beat until smooth. Add egg, sugar, spice and salt; beat to blend. Transfer mixture to 8 x 8-inch baking dish. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Bring to room temperature before continuing.) Bake potatoes until beginning to brown around edges and slightly puffed, about 25 minutes.
Meanwhile, prepare topping: Mix together all ingredients in medium bowl.
Spoon topping evenly over potatoes. Bake until golden brown and crisp, about 10 minutes longer.

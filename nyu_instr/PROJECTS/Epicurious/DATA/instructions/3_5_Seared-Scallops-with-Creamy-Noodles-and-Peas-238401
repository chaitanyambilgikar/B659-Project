Cook noodles in a large pot of boiling salted water , uncovered, until almost al dente, about 5 minutes, then stir in peas and cook until noodles are al dente, about 2 minutes more. Drain in a colander, then transfer to a platter and keep warm, loosely covered with foil.
While noodles cook, pat scallops dry and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Heat butter in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until foam subsides, then add scallops. Increase heat to high and sear scallops, turning over once, until golden brown and just cooked through, 2 minutes total. Transfer to platter with noodles and keep covered.
Add wine to skillet and deglaze by boiling, stirring and scraping up any brown bits, 1 minute. Stir in water and cream and boil until slightly reduced, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in chives and pour sauce over scallops and noodles.

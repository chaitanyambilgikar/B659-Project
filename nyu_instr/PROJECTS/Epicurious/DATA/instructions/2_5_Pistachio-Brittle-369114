Line a baking sheet with parchment paper; lightly coat paper with vegetable oil cooking spray. In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, bring 1 cup sugar, 1/4 cup light corn syrup, 1/4 cup water and 2 tablespoons unsalted butter to a simmer; cook, stirring often, until mixture is a medium caramel color, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in 1/4 teaspoon baking soda (mixture will foam), 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract and 1 cup dry-roasted shelled unsalted pistachios. Pour onto baking sheet; spread into an even layer. Cool completely. Break into 24 pieces.

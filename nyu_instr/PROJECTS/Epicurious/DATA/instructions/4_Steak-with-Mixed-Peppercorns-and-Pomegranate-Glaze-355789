Sprinkle steak very generously with coarsely ground peppercorn mélange and salt. Sprinkle each side of steak with half of chopped rosemary. Heat 1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add steak; cook to desired doneness, about 5 minutes per side for medium-rare. Transfer steak to platter. Add pomegranate juice, golden brown sugar, and 2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar to skillet; boil until reduced to scant 1/4 cup glaze, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Season glaze to taste with salt.
Toss arugula with remaining 1 teaspoon olive oil and remaining 1/2 teaspoon balsamic vinegar in medium bowl; season to taste with salt. Divide arugula evenly among 4 plates. Slice steak; divide and arrange alongside arugula. Drizzle glaze generously around steak and serve.

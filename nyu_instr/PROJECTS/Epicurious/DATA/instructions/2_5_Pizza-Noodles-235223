1. Cook the pasta according to the package directions. Drain thoroughly.
2. Preheat the oven to 400°F. Spread the oil around the bottom and sides of a 3-quart baking dish.
3. In a large bowl (or the pot you cooked the pasta in), mix together the pasta and sauce. Gently fold in the ricotta cheese. (You just want it to be partially and unevenly blended in.)
4. Put the pasta mixture into the baking dish. Cover with mozzarella and bake for 25 minutes, or until the cheese is all melty and spotty brown. Serve with grated cheese.

Soak 8 wooden skewers in water overnight.
To make the marinade, combine all the ingredients in a nonreactive bowl.
Cut the pork into 1-inch cubes. Add the pork to the marinade, toss to coat and refrigerate for at least 3 hours.
Set up the outdoor grill for direct-heat cooking over high heat. Thread the pork onto the skewers (use gloves to avoid staining your hands) and cook on the grill for 5 minutes on each side or until cooked through. Warm the naan bread briefly on the grill and serve with the tandoori pork, yogurt and cucumber.

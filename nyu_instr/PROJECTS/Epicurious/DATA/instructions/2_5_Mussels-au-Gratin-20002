Blend the butter and the seasoning together and let stand 1 hour. Scrub and beard the mussels. Place them in a heavy skillet or pot with onion and enough white wine to cover the bottom of the pot well. Cover and steam over a medium flame until the mussels open. When cool enough to handle, remove one half shell from each mussel. Spoon butter mixture on mussels and sprinkle with crumbs. Bake at 425°F. just long enough to heat through. Serve on hot plates.

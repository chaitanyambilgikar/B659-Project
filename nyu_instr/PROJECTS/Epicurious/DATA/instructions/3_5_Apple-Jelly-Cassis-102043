Quarter the apples and simmer in the water in a covered pot until reduced to a pulp. Drip through a jelly bag overnight. (If you do not have a jelly bag, line a colander with 4 thicknesses of cheesecloth and set over a bowl.) The next day, measure 6 cups of juice into a large preserving kettle. (If the juice is insufficient, add water.) Add the sugar and bring to a boil over high heat, stirring constantly until the sugar is dissolved. Continue to boil until a thermometer registers 220° or until the juice thickens and sheets from the side of the spoon (i.e., when the last 2 drops on the spoon run together). Remove from the heat, skim the top and stir in the cassis. Pour into hot, sterilized jelly glasses and cover with a thin layer of melted paraffin. When the paraffin has hardened, cover the glasses and store.

Cut a 1/2" slice from the stem end of the peppers and reserve. Carefully remove and discard seeds. Cover the peppers with well-salted cold water and let stand overnight. The next day, drain the peppers. Chop the cabbage fine, and mix with cloves, salt, celery seed, mustard seed and cinnamon. Fill the peppers with this mixture, replace end slices and tie in place. Place the peppers upright in a crock or large jars. Bring the vinegar and sugar to a boil and pour over the peppers. Place a plate or lid on top of the peppers, weight the plate, and cover the crock. Leave in a cool place for 3 weeks before using so that the flavors have time to mellow.

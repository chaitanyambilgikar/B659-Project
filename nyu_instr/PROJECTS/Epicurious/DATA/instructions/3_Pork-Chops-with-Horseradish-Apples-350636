Pat chops dry and season with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.
Heat oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Sauté chops, turning once, until browned and cooked through, about 8 minutes. Transfer to a plate and keep warm, loosely covered.
Reduce heat to medium and add onion, apples, and 1/8 teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onion begins to soften, about 3 minutes. Add wine and water and simmer, covered, stirring occasionally, until apples are tender but not falling apart, about 12 minutes. Stir in horseradish, chives, and meat juices from plate. Season with salt and pepper. Serve chops with sauce.

In a 2 1/2- to 3-quart heavy saucepan combine all ingredients and boil, uncovered, until steam holes appear in rice and grains on surface appear dry, about 8 minutes. Cover pan and cook rice over very low heat 15 minutes more. Remove pan from heat and let rice stand, covered, 5 minutes.
Fluff rice with a fork before serving.

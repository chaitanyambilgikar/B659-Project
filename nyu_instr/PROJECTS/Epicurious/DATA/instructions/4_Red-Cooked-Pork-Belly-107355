Bring water to a boil in a 3- to 4-quart heavy pot. Add pork belly and return water to a boil. Skim foam, then add wine. Reduce heat to moderate and briskly simmer, partially covered, skimming occasionally, 20 minutes. Add all remaining ingredients except bok choy, reduce heat to low, and simmer, partially covered, turning pork occasionally, until skin and meat are very tender, about 3 hours.
Transfer pork with tongs and a spatula to a platter and keep warm, covered with foil. Pour cooking liquid into a 12-inch heavy skillet (do not skim off fat) and boil until reduced to a syrup (about 1 cup), about 25 minutes. Pour through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, discarding solids.
Cook bok choy in a large pot of boiling water until bright green and crisp-tender, about 2 minutes. Drain thoroughly in a colander and pat dry with paper towels. Arrange bok choy around pork and pour sauce over meat, drizzling a little over vegetables.

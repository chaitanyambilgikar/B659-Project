Bring water and sugar to a boil in a 2-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Add orange and gently simmer over moderately low heat, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until peel begins to turn translucent and syrup is reduced to about 2/3 cup, 25 to 35 minutes.
Transfer to a heatproof bowl and cool. Stir in cranberries and Grand Marnier and chill, covered, until cold, about 1 hour.

Bring half-and-half, brown sugar, corn syrup, and salt to a boil in a 2-quart heavy saucepan over moderately high heat, whisking until smooth. Remove from heat and whisk in peanut butter until smooth. Transfer to a glass measure or small heatproof pitcher and cool slightly, about 5 minutes.
Divide ice cream among 4 bowls, then top each serving with some banana slices and 3 tablespoons peanut butter sauce. (You will have some sauce left over.)

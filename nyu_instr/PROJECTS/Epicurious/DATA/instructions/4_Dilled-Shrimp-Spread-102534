Cook shrimp in boiling salted water, stirring once or twice, until pink and just cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain in a colander and cool completely. Blend garlic, mayonnaise, oil, chili sauce, dill, celery seeds, and salt in a food processor until smooth. Add shrimp, celery, and onion and pulse until shrimp is chopped. Transfer to a serving bowl and chill, covered, until cold, about 1 hour.

Cut the potatoes and eggs into small chunks about a 1/2 inch square. Put them in a bowl with the mayonnaise, curry powder, salt, pepper, olives, and reserved brine and mix until well combined. If you find that the ingredients aren't wet enough, you can add more mayonnaise — everything should hold together nicely. Let stand overnight to give the ingredients a chance to marinate. Taste the next day for seasoning. If necessary, add more curry powder, salt, or pepper.

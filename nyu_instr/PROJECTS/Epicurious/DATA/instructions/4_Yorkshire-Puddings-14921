In a blender blend flour, salt, eggs, and milk until just smooth. Chill batter, covered 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 425°F.
Arrange four 5 1/2-inch pie plates* in a large shallow baking pan and spoon 1 tablespoon oil or beef fat into each. Put baking pan in middle of oven 5 minutes to heat oil. Quickly pour 1/2 cup batter into each pie plate and bake in middle of oven until puddings are puffed and golden brown, about 18 minutes. With tongs remove puddings from pie plates and serve immediately.

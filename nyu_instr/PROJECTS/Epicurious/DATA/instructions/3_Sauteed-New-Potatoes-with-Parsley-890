Using vegetable peeler, remove a narrow strip of peel from around middle of each potato. Cook potatoes in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender, about 15 minutes. Drain. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
Melt butter in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add potatoes and sauté until crisp and golden, about 7 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to bowl. Sprinkle with parsley.

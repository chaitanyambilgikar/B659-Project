Preheat oven to 400°F. Arrange tomatoes, rounded side down, in single layer in 13x9x2-inch glass baking dish. Sprinkle with anchovies, parsley, garlic and dried red pepper, then salt and pepper. Drizzle with oil. Bake tomatoes uncovered until tender, wrinkled and starting to brown at edges, about 40 minutes.

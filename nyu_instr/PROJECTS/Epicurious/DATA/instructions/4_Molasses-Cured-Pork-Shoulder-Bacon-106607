Put pork butt, fat side up, on a work surface, then halve horizontally with a sharp large knife.
Stir together water, salt, brown sugar, and Instacure in storage tub until solids are dissolved, about 3 minutes, then add molasses and stir until dissolved. Add ice and stir until cure is cold (ice may not be completely melted; keeping liquid cold slows salt absorption).
Add pork to cure, then weight with a large plate to keep submerged. Chill, tub covered with a lid or plastic wrap, 36 hours.
Rinse pork and pat dry, then discard brine. Sprinkle pork evenly with pepper (if using).
Prepare grill and smoke bacon: See preceding recipe.
Cut bacon crosswise into 1/8-inch-thick slices with a sharp knife, then fry in a heavy skillet over moderately low heat, turning, until browned. Transfer to paper towels to drain.

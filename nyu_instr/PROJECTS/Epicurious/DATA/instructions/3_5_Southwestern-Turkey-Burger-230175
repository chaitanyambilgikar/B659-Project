In a large bowl, combine egg white, cheese, turkey, salt, kidney beans, breadcrumbs, onion, cilantro, and salsa and mix thoroughly. Divide the mixture and form into 4 patties. Tuck any pieces of cheese into the burgers with your fingertip to prevent scorching. Heat oil in a large nonstick pan over medium heat. Add burgers and cook 6 to 7 minutes per side or until cooked through. Serve on English muffins, accompanied by lettuce and extra salsa (to use as a topping).

Peel, core and thinly slice all apples. Place apples in large microwave-safe bowl. Add 1/4 cup water to bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and microwave on high 10 minutes. Stir apples. Continue to microwave, uncovered, until apples are very tender, about 5 minutes longer. Using large fork, coarsely mash apples. Mix in 1 tablespoon sugar. (Applesauce can be prepared 2 days ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)

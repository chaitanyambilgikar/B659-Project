In a heavy saucepan whisk together the cream of coconut and the heavy cream, bring the mixture to a simmer, and whisk in the chocolates, whisking until they are melted and the sauce is smooth. Whisk in the coconut extract, the salt, and the Malibu and serve the sauce warm or at room temperature over ice cream.

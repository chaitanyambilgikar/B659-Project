In a small bowl whisk together the vinegar and salt and pepper to taste, add the oil in a stream, whisking, and whisk the dressing until it is emulsified. In a bowl toss the beets with one third of the dressing, in another bowl toss the radish with half the remaining dressing, and in a large bowl toss the mâche with the remaining dressing. Arrange the mâche, the beets, and the radish decoratively on 6 salad plates.

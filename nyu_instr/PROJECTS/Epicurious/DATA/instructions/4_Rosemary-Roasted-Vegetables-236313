Preheat the oven to 400°F.
Peel and trim the parsnips and carrots. Cut the slender ends into 1 1/4- to 1 1/2-inch lengths. Cut the fat ends in half lengthwise and then into 1 1/4- to 1 1/2-inch lengths.
Peel and trim the turnips. If small, cut them into wedges about 1/2- to 3/4-inch thick. If large, cut the turnip in half through the equator, then cut into wedges. Peel the sweet potatoes. Cut in half lengthwise and then slice lengthwise about 1/2 inch thick; cut slices into 1 1/4- to 1 1/2-inch sections.
In a 9x13-inch baking dish, toss the parsnips, carrots, turnips, sweet potatoes, and shallots with the oil and salt. Roast for 25 minutes. Add the rosemary and garlic, toss again, and continue roasting until the vegetables are browned and tender, another 20 to 25 minutes. Scrape out into a serving dish, sprinkle with the pepper, and serve hot.

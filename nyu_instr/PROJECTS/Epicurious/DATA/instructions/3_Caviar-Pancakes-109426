Cook butter in a very small saucepan over moderate heat, swirling pan occasionally, until golden brown (be careful not to let it burn). Keep butter warm.
Spread each pancake with about 1 tablespoon sour cream (to taste) and top with about 1 teaspoon caviar. Sprinkle with some of yolk and scallion. Stack 3 pancakes on each of 2 plates and drizzle with brown butter.

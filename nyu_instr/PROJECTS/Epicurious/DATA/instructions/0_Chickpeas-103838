Drain chickpeas and return to pan. Add water to cover by 4 inches, onion, and thyme and simmer, uncovered, until chickpeas are tender, about 1 1/4 hours, adding salt during last 10 minutes of cooking.
Drain chickpeas and transfer to a bowl of cold water. Slip skins from chickpeas by rubbing them with your fingers, then drain well.

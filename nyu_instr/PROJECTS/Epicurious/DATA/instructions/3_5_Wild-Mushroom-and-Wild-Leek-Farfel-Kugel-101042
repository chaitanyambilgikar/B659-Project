In a large skillet over medium heat, stir together the eggs and farfel. Continue to stir until farfel has absorbed the eggs and gets dry and toasty.
In another skillet, heat butter or oil over medium heat and stir in minced onion. Cook until golden, then add leeks and continue cooking for 15 minutes. In a seperate pan on high heat cook mushrooms for about 4 minutes. Combine leeks, onions and mushrooms.
Add farfel and half of the stock to the leek/onion/mushroom mixture, continuing to stir. Turn heat to low and add 1 more cup of stock. Cook 4 minutes and add last cup of stock. When all the liquid has been absorbed, serve.

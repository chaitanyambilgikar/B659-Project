Heat oil in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onions and sauté until deep brown, about 15 minutes. Add barley and stir 30 seconds. Add mushrooms; sauté until barley browns and mushrooms begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Add broth. Bring mixture to boil. Cover pan; reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer until barley is tender and broth is absorbed, about 25 minutes. Mix in pasta. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve.

In a 9-inch skillet heat 1/2 inch oil to 380°F. on a deep-fat thermometer. Shake off excess flour from half of onion rings and fry them, turning, until golden 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer onion rings with tongs to paper towels to drain and fry remaining onion rings in same manner.
In a vegetable steamer set over boiling water steam beans, covered, about 6 minutes, or until tender. In a large bowl toss beans with onion rings, butter, Worcestershire sauce, and salt and pepper to taste.

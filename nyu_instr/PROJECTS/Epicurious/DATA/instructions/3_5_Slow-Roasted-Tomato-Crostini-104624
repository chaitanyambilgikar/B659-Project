Preheat oven to 350°F.
Arrange tomatoes, cut sides up, in a shallow baking dish just large enough to hold them in 1 layer. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons oil and season with salt and pepper. Scatter garlic around tomatoes, then roast in middle of oven until tomatoes are tender and skins are wrinkled, about 1 hour. Cool, then transfer tomatoes to a plate, reserving garlic and oil in baking dish.
While tomatoes are cooling, put bread slices on a baking sheet and brush lightly on both sides with additional oil. Bake in middle of oven until golden, 15 to 18 minutes.
Peel roasted garlic cloves and mash to a paste with oil and juices from baking dish. Spread paste on toasts, then top each toast with a tomato half, cut side up.
Serve crostini topped with mint and olives.

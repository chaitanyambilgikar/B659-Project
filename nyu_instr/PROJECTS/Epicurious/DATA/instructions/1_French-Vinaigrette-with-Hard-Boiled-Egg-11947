In a bowl whisk together the mustard, the vinegar, and salt to taste, add the oil in a stream, whisking, and whisk the vinaigrette until it is emulsified. Stir in the parsley. Halve the egg lengthwise, reserving one half for another use, force the remaining half through a coarse sieve into the bowl, and stir the vinaigrette until it is combined well.

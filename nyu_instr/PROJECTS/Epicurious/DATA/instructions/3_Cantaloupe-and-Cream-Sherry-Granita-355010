Bring water and sugar to a boil, stirring until sugar has dissolved, then cool syrup.
Purée cantaloupes with syrup, lemon juice, Sherry, and 1/8 teaspoon salt in a blender (in batches if necessary) until smooth. Pour into a 13- by 9-inch nonreactive baking dish and freeze until partially frozen, about 2 hours. Scrape and stir with a fork, crushing any lumps.
Continue to freeze, scraping once or twice, until evenly frozen, about 3 hours more.

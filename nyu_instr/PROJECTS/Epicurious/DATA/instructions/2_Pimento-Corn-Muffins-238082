Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 425°F. Generously butter muffin cups.
Whisk together cornmeal, flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl.
Whisk together eggs, buttermilk, and butter (1/2 stick) in another bowl, then stir into flour mixture along with pimentos until just combined.
Divide batter among muffin cups (about 1/3 cup each) and bake until a wooden pick inserted in center of a muffin comes out clean, about 12 minutes. Turn out muffins onto a rack and cool to warm.

Cook bacon in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat until crisp. Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towel to drain. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon fat from skillet. Add carrots, peas and parsley and sauté 1 minute. Mix in cream and Parmesan and simmer sauce until it thickens slightly, about 3 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Place fettuccine in large bowl. Add cream mixture and toss well. Sprinkle with cooked bacon and serve.

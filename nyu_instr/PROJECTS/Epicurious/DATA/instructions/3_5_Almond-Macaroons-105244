Preheat oven to 300°F.
Finely grind 3/4 cup almonds with sugar, flour, and salt in a food processor, then add egg white and extracts and pulse until evenly moistened.
Form rounded teaspoons of dough into 1-inch balls with lightly floured hands and arrange 1 1/2 inches apart on a greased large baking sheet. Press a whole almond in center of each ball to flatten cookie slightly (to about 1/2 inch thick).
Bake in middle of oven until edges are firm to the touch, 18 to 20 minutes, then transfer to a rack to cool.

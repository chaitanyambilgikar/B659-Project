Preheat oven to 450°F.
In a small saucepan melt butter over moderate heat and stir in brown sugar, water, and cardamom until sugar is dissolved. Quarter pear lengthwise and core. Cut each pear quarter in half lengthwise and in an 8-inch square baking pan toss with syrup. Roast pears in middle of oven, turning once, until tender and syrup is caramelized, about 15 minutes.
Transfer pears with a slotted spoon to 2 plates and stir rum into syrup until combined well. Scoop ice cream onto plates and spoon syrup over it.

Place the mussels, the white wine, and the garlic in a large stockpot, cover, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook, shaking the pan occasionally, until the mussels open, then cook for an additional minute. Remove from the heat and shower the mussels with black pepper. Mince the parsley and shower it over the mussels as well. Evenly divide the mussels among 4 shallow soup bowls, and pour the cooking juices over all. Serve immediately.

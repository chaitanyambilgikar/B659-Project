Chop bacon and in a 2-quart heavy saucepan cook over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until crisp. Transfer bacon with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain, reserving fat in pan.
While bacon is cooking, cut onion into 1/4-inch dice. Peel potatoes and cut into 1/4-inch dice. Stir onion, potatoes, and water into bacon fat and simmer, covered, until potatoes are tender and most of water is evaporated, about 15 minutes.
While mixture is simmering, pick over crab meat, removing any bits of shell and cartilage. Stir milk and cayenne into mixture and return just to a simmer. Add crab and salt and pepper to taste and bring chowder to a simmer.
Serve chowder garnished with parsley and bacon.

Place 2 1/2 cups BA Biscuit Mix in a large bowl and set aside. Separate 3 large eggs, placing yolks in a medium bowl and whites in a large bowl. Add 1 1/4 cups whole milk to the yolks; whisk to combine. Whisk egg whites until medium peaks form. Working quickly, stir milk mixture into dry ingredients until just combined. Fold in egg whites. Cook in batches in a buttered skillet or on a griddle.

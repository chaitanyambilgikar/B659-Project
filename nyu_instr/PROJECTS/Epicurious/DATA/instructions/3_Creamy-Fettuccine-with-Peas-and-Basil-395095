In a bowl, whisk oat milk, cashew butter and 1/2 teaspoon salt until big lumps disappear. In a large nonstick skillet, heat oil over medium heat. Cook garlic, stirring, until golden, 1 minute. Stir in milk mixture; reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring frequently, until thick and fragrant, 2 minutes. Stir in peas; turn off heat. Cook pasta as directed on package with remaining 1 teaspoon salt until just tender. Drain pasta, reserving 1 cup cooking liquid. Heat milk and pea mixture over low heat for 2 minutes. Toss in pasta; add cooking water as needed to thin sauce to desired thickness; toss to thoroughly coat pasta. Garnish with basil and black pepper; serve.

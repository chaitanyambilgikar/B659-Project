Whisk lemon juice and honey in a medium bowl. Add cabbage, carrot, onion, and dill; toss to coat. Season with salt and pepper.
Season beef with salt and pepper. Place flour in a shallow dish. Place eggs in another dish and breadcrumbs in a third dish.
Pour oil into a large heavy deep skillet to a depth of 1/4". Heat over medium-high heat. Working with one slice of beef at a time, dredge in flour, shaking off excess. Dip beef in eggs, allowing excess to drip back into bowl, and transfer to breadcrumbs; turn and pat to coat. Transfer beef to skillet and cook until golden brown, about 1 minute. Carefully turn; cook 1 minute longer. Repeat with remaining beef. Divide beef among plates; mound slaw over. Serve with lemon wedges.

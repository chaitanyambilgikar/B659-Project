For tomato salsa, combine everything in a bowl. Season with pepper. Cover and set aside. (Don't add salt yet; it pulls flavor from tomatoes.) For salmon balls, combine all ingredients except oil and arugula in a bowl. Mix well. Form walnut-sized balls (about 16); set aside. In large nonstick frying pan, heat oil over medium heat. Add balls and cook 4 to 6 minutes, turning to brown all sides. Divide arugula among 4 plates. Place 4 balls in center of each and serve with salsa. Sprinkle with salt.

Whisk 3/4 cup flour, ale, 2 egg whites, salt and pepper in medium bowl until smooth. Cover and let stand at room temperature 2 hours.
Preheat oven to 250°F. Line baking sheet with paper towels. Beat remaining 2 egg whites in large bowl until soft peaks form. Stir 1/3 of whites into ale batter, then fold in remaining whites.
Melt shortening in heavy large pot over medium heat until thermometer registers 375°F.
Meanwhile, place 1 cup flour in pie dish. Working in batches, coat shrimp with flour; shake off excess. Holding shrimp by tail, dip into batter until well coated. Carefully lower shrimp a few at a time into hot shortening. Fry until golden brown and cooked through, about 1 minute per side. Using tongs, transfer shrimp to prepared sheet. Keep warm in oven while cooking remaining shrimp. Serve shrimp with Tartar Sauce.

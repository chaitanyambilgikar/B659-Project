Lightly oil pizza pan and sprinkle evenly with cornmeal. Put oven rack in lowest position and preheat oven to 425°F.
Mix flour mix, millet flour, xanthan gum, salt, sugar, and yeast in a large bowl with an electric mixer at medium speed. Add water and 1 teaspoon oil and mix until just combined, scraping down side of bowl occasionally. Mixture will be thin and more like a batter than a dough. Increase speed to high and beat until smooth, about 2 minutes.
Spoon batter into center of pan and use wet offset spatula to spread to edges of pan in a thin layer.
Loosely cover pan with an oiled sheet of plastic (oiled side down) and let stand in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 40 minutes.
Bake pizza crust until golden, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven and cover crust with toppings of your choice. Bake until toppings are heated through, about 6 minutes (this will vary depending on toppings). Transfer pizza on pan to a rack to cool slightly, about 3 minutes.

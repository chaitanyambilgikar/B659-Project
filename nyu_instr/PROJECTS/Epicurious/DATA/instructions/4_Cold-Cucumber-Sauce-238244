1. Cut the cucumbers into 1/8-inch dice with a chef's knife, or pulse them in a food processor until chopped into 1/8-inch pieces (do not over process). Place the cucumbers in a large stainless steel strainer set in the sink or over a bowl, sprinkle them with 1 teaspoon salt, and let them drain for 30 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, place the onion in a small bowl, cover with cold water, and let stand for 30 minutes.
3. Transfer the cucumbers to a large bowl, squeezing the last bit of excess moisture from them with your hands before you place them in the bowl. Drain the onion thoroughly and add to the cucumbers. Add the yogurt, sour cream, herbs, and jalapeño, if using. Mix gently, and add the lemon juice. Season with black pepper, taste, and add more lemon or salt as you wish. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving. The sauce keeps refrigerated for 2 days.

1. Bring all fish broth ingredients except cod to a boil in a large skillet; reduce to a simmer. Add cod; simmer 7-8 minutes or until fish is cooked through. Gently remove cod to a plate with a slotted spoon; reserve.
2. Prepare serving broth: Place olive oil in a heavy saucepan over low heat. Add ginger and garlic; cook over medium-low heat for 3 minutes. Add broth and cook, partially covered, for 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Let steep, covered, 15 minutes longer. Strain the broth into another saucepan; set aside. Heat before serving.
3. Arrange cod, pasta, tomatoes, and broccoli in a pinwheel fashion in each of 4 large bowls. Top each with 1 1/4 cups hot serving broth. Sprinkle with scallions. Place a lime slice in the center of each and garnish with parsley or basil. Serve immediately.

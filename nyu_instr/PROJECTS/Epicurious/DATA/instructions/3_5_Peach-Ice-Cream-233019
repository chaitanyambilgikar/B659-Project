Stir peaches together with sugar and lemon juice in a bowl. While you cool the cooked custard, transfer the peaches and the liquid in the bowl to a 2-quart heavy saucepan and boil, covered, over high heat, stirring, 10 minutes, and then simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, 30 minutes more.
Purée the hot mixture in a blender (careful!) until smooth, about 1 minute. Force it through a sieve into the custard mixture, pressing on the solids with the back of a spoon and discarding them. Cool to room temperature, stirring occasionally, about 45 minutes. Stir in 1/4 teaspoon almond extract and freeze the custard according to the cranberry ice cream directions.

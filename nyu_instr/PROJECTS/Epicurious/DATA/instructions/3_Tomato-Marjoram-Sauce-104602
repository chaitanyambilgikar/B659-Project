Heat oil in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and garlic and sauté until tender, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes with juices, marjoram and fennel seeds and simmer until flavors blend and sauce thickens slightly, about 15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Rewarm over medium heat before serving.)

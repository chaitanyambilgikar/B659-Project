For salsa: Using small sharp knife, cut off peel and white pith from oranges. Working over medium bowl, cut between membranes to release sections. Cut each section crosswise into 4 pieces and add to bowl. Mix in remaining ingredients. Cover; chill at least 1 hour and up to 4 hours.
For carpaccio: Combine first 4 ingredients and lavender, if using, in mortar and coarsely crush with pestle (or place in resealable plastic bag and coarsely crush with rolling pin).
Rub 1 tablespoon oil over beef, then coat beef with spice mixture. Let stand 1 hour at room temperature.
Heat 3 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over high heat. Add beef and sear on all sides, turning every 2 minutes, about 12 minutes total (beef will be rare in center). Chill until cold, then wrap in plastic and freeze 1 hour.
Slice meat as thinly as possible (sliced meat can be pounded between layers of waxed paper until paper-thin, if desired). Toss arugula with juices from salsa and mound on platter. Top with salsa. Surround with meat and cheese.

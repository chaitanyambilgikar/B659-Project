Method 1. To make the marinade, whisk all the ingredients together in a large bowl. Add the squid, cover, and let marinate in the refrigerator for 3 to 4 hours.
2. Prepare a hot fire in a grill. Oil a perforated grill rack or a cast-iron grill griddle and preheat on the grill.
3. Remove the squid from the marinade. Place the squid on the prepared grill rack and grill for 4 minutes, turning once, or until the squid are almost opaque all the way through and have crisped around the ends and tentacles. Do not overcook or they will become rubbery.
4. To serve, arrange on a platter, drizzle with olive oil, and scatter with parsley.

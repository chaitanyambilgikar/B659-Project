1. Place one nori sheet, shiny side down, on a clean, dry surface. If using lettuce leaves instead, wash and dry whole leaves and cut off the bottom 1-inch of stem.
2. Drop 2 tablespoons of guacamole onto the nori sheet or lettuce leaf. Spread the guacamole across the sheet using the back of a spoon, being careful not to tear the sheet or leaf.
3. Spread 2 tablespoons each of the carrot, cucumber, and sprouts across the guacamole.
4. Lay 2 tablespoons of the chicken, salmon, or tofu (if using) across the vegetables and roll up the nori or lettuce leaf like a burrito, gently rolling one side over until the wrap is complete.

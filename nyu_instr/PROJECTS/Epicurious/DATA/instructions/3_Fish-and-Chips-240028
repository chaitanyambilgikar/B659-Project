1. Peel the potatoes and cut them into strips that are 1/4 inch thick and 3 inches long.
2. In a deep-sided pot, heat 3 inches of oil to 325°F. (Please remember to use caution when cooking with hot oil.) Put the potatoes in the oil. Fry until they have softened and become slightly browned but not crisp, 2 to 3 minutes.
3. Remove the chips with a large slotted spoon and set them aside on paper towels.
4. Increase heat until the oil reaches a temperature of 375°F. In a large mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, baking powder, salt, pepper, and eggs. Pour in the soda water and whisk until the batter is smooth. Spread the rice flour on a separate plate. Dredge the fish pieces in it, then dip them into the batter, letting the excess drip off.
5. Put the chips in the bottom of a fryer basket (or use a slotted spoon) and carefully submerge them in the hot oil. Carefully add the fish to the bubbling oil. Fry the fish-and-chips until crispy and brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove the basket and drain the fish-and-chips on paper towels; season lightly with the salt and pepper. Serve with the Aioli and Mignonette Dipping Sauce .

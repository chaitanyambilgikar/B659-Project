Preheat broiler.
Cut cheese into thin slices. Halve pear lengthwise and core with a lemon-ball cutter. Slice pear thin crosswise.
On a baking sheet toast both sides of bread about 3 inches from heat until golden. Divide watercress among toasts and cover with overlapping pear slices. Arrange cheese over pear slices and broil sandwiches until cheese is melted, about 1 minute.

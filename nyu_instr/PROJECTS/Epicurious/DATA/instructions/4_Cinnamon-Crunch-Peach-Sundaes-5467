Stir 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar, 3/4 cup water, corn syrup and halved cinnamon sticks in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves; bring to boil. Reduce heat to low; simmer until syrup is reduced to 1¤ cups, about 20 minutes. Cool; remove cinnamon sticks. (Can be made 1 week ahead. Cover; refrigerate.)
Preheat oven to 350°F. Combine cracker crumbs, butter and 1 1/2 tablespoons sugar in small bowl; toss to coat evenly. Spread mixture out on small baking sheet. Bake until golden, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Cool.
Mix peaches, 3 tablespoons sugar, lemon juice and ground cinnamon in medium bowl. Let stand until juices form, at least 15 minutes and up to 1 hour.
Place 2 scoops of ice cream in each of 6 bowls. Spoon peaches and juices over ice cream. Drizzle with syrup and sprinkle with crunch topping. Garnish with cinnamon sticks, if desired, and serve.

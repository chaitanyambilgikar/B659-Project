Soak 3 salt pork strips in cognac for 2 hours. Run them through the edges of the beef with the larding needle.Roll the filets in pepper and broil over coals for about 25 minutes, to 120°F. on thermometer, turning often. Season to taste with salt. Or you can spit the filets and roast them over charcoal for the same length of time. If you use a meat thermometer, remove the filets when it registers 120°F. This is for very rare, but filets are best at this stage.
To serve: Cream butter and blend it with rosemary. Heat French bread and split the loaf. Spread each half liberally with the rosemary butter. Cut the filet in paper thin slices and arrange these on the hot buttered French bread. Let guests eat these as sandwiches, or with knife and fork.

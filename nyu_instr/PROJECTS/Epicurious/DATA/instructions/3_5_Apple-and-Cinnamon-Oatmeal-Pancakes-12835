In a bowl whisk together 1 cup of the buttermilk and the oats and let the mixture stand for 15 minutes. In a large bowl whisk together the egg, the brown sugar, and the apple. Stir in the flours, the baking soda, the salt, the cinnamon, 2 tablespoons of the oil, the oats mixture, and the remaining 1/4 cup buttermilk and combine the batter well. Heat a griddle over moderate heat until it is hot enough to make drops of water scatter over its surface, brush it with the additional oil, and drop the batter by half-filled 1/4-cup measures onto it. Cook the pancakes for 1 to 2 minutes on each side, or until they are golden and cooked through. Serve the pancakes with syrup.

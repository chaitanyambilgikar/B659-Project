Line cookie sheet with foil. Mix dates and 1 tablespoon bourbon in bowl; set aside. Bring cream, syrup, butter and nutmeg to simmer in heavy medium saucepan, stirring frequently. Remove from heat. Add chocolate and whisk until smooth and melted. Stir in date mixture and remaining 1 tablespoon bourbon. Freeze mixture until firm enough to mound on spoon, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes.
Drop chocolate mixture by rounded tablespoons onto foil-lined sheet. Freeze until almost firm, about 10 minutes. Roll each mound in pecans. Chill until firm. (Can be prepared 2 weeks ahead. Cover and keep refrigerated.) Serve cold.

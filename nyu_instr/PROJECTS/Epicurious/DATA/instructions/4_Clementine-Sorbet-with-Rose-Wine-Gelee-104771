Make sorbet: Finely grate enough zest from clementines to measure 1 teaspoon. Squeeze enough juice from clementines to measure 1 1/2 cups and transfer to a bowl.
Bring zest, sugar, and water to a boil in a small saucepan over moderate heat, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Pour through a very fine sieve into clementine juice.
Freeze in ice-cream maker. Transfer to an airtight container and put in freezer to harden.
Make gelée: Sprinkle gelatin over water in a small saucepan and let soften 1 minute. Add sugar and wine, then simmer, stirring constantly until sugar and gelatin are dissolved and liquid is clear (whitish foam will disappear). Remove from heat, stir in lemon juice, then transfer to a metal bowl.
Chill, uncovered, until set, about 4 hours.
Gently whisk gelée to break into small pieces. Serve scoops of sorbet in stemmed glasses and top with gelée.

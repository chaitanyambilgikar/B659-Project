Combine 2 cups water, sugar, allspice, cayenne and paprika in heavy small saucepan. Bring to boil; boil until mixture registers 220°F on candy thermometer, about 3 minutes. Add pecans and cook until syrup clings to pecans, about 5 minutes. Drain pecans well.
Pour enough oil into heavy large saucepan to reach depth of 1 inch. Heat oil to 350Â°F. Add pecans and fry until brown and crisp, about 2 minutes. Working quickly so that pecans donâ€™t burn, use slotted spoon to transfer pecans to paper towels. Cool. (Can be made 1 week ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.)

1. Combine all of the marinade ingredients in a bowl. Add the chops, coat well and refrigerate, covered, to marinate for 20 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, combine all of the salad ingredients in a single large bowl.
3. Combine all of the dressing ingredients, then fold into the salad. Refrigerate the salad for up to 2 hours before serving, if necessary.
4. Remove the lamb chops from the marinade. Broil or grill about 3 inches from the heat source for 4 to 5 minutes on each side for medium-rare meat. Serve immediately with the salad alongside.

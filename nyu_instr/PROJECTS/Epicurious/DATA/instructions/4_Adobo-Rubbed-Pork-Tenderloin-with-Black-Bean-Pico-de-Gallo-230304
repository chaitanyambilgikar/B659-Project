For pork: Preheat oven to 350°F. In small bowl, mix paprika, black pepper, salt, chili powder, sugar, and cayenne. Rub both sides of each tenderloin piece with spice mixture. Preheat oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat and pan-sear pieces until golden brown on both sides. Transfer to oven until done (6 to 8 minutes for each inch of thickness).
To make pico de gallo, mix all ingredients. Serve 1/2 cup over tenderloin.

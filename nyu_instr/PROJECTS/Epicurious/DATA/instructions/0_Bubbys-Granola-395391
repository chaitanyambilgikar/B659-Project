1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Lightly oil two baking sheets.
2. Combine the vegetable oil, honey, molasses, and salt in a small heavy saucepan over low heat. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes, or until well blended and very hot. Remove the mixture from the heat.
3. Combine the rolled oats, pecans, walnuts, sesame seeds, pumpkin seeds, and sunflower seeds in a large bowl.
4. Pour the honey mixture over the oat mixture and toss briskly to combine. Be sure all the oats, nuts, and seeds are thoroughly coated.
5. Spread out the granola evenly on the prepared baking sheets. Bake for about 30 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes or so, until golden (not dark) brown. Be careful not to overbake it.
6. Remove the pans from the oven and allow the granola to cool completely. It will be crispy when it cools. Transfer the granola to a large container with a lid. Store, tightly covered, at room temperature. Just before serving, add the raisins.

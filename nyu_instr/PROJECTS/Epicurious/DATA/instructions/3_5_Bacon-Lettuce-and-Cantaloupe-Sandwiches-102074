Preheat oven to 425°F.
In a shallow baking pan cook bacon in one layer in middle of oven, turning occasionally, until golden and crisp, 16 to 18 minutes, and transfer to paper towels to drain.
In a small bowl whisk together mayonnaise, mustard, lemon juice, and honey until smooth.
Seed cantaloupe. Cut melon into 12 slices and discard rind. Cut out and discard lettuce ribs.
Spread mayonnaise mixture on all 8 slices of bread. Stack lettuce, melon, and bacon on 4 of the slices and top with remaining 4 slices, gently pressing them together.

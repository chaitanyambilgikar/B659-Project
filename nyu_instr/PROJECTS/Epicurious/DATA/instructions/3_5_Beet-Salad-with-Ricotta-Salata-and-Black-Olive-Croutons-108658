Make croutons: Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 400°F.
Stir together olive paste, oil, and a pinch of pepper in a bowl, then add bread, gently tossing to coat. Spread bread in 1 layer in a shallow baking pan and toast, stirring once, until golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool in pan on a rack, then transfer to a small bowl.
Roast beets for salad: Increase oven temperature to 425°F.
Wrap beets tightly in double layers of foil in 4 bundles (about 10 beets each) and roast until tender, about 1 hour.
Carefully unwrap beets and, when cool enough to handle, slip off and discard skins. Trim beets and halve lengthwise.
Make vinaigrette while beets cool: Whisk together shallot, mustard, vinegar, lemon juice, soy sauce, and salt in a small bowl, then add oil in a slow stream, whisking until emulsified. Season with pepper.
Assemble salad: Toss beets with 1/4 cup vinaigrette in a bowl, then season with salt and pepper. Divide beets among 8 plates and top with frisée. Drizzle frisée with remaining vinaigrette and sprinkle croutons on top. Shave thin slices of ricotta salata over each salad using a cheese plane or a vegetable peeler.

In an 11 1/2- to 12-inch non-stick skillet heat the butter over low heat until it is melted and crack the eggs, 1 at a time, into a small bowl, adding them as they are cracked to the skillet. Cook the eggs, covered, for 3 minutes, remove the cover, and cook the eggs for 4 minutes more, or until the yolks are set.

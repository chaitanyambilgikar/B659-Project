Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil, add the pasta, and cook until tender, about 10 minutes, or according to package instructions.
Meanwhile, put the beans and carrots in a steamer and cook for 4 minutes. Add the corn to the steamer and cook for 3-4 minutes, or until tender.
Combine all the ingredients for the dressing in a blender or food processor, adding only a little salt and pepper, and process until smooth. Combine the cooked pasta with the vegetables and cherry tomatoes and toss with some of the dressing.
Variation: Add 2 Tbsp (30 g) diced cucumber, 1/2 cup (75 g) diced cold chicken or tuna to this salad, and vary the vegetables, according to taste.

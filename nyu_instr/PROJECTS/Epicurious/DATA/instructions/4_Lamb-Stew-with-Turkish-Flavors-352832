Pat lamb dry and season with 1 teaspoon salt and 3/4 teaspoon pepper. Heat oil in a wide 5-to 6-quart heavy pot over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Brown lamb on all sides in 3 batches until golden-brown, 4 to 5 minutes per batch, transferring to a plate with a slotted spoon.
Add onions to pot and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden-brown, about 8 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Stir in vinegar and cook, scraping up brown bits, until vinegar has evaporated, 1 to 2 minutes.
Return lamb with meat juices to pot. Stir in stock, chickpeas, preserves, and spices (including Maras and Urfa pepper) and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, 1 hour.
Peel potatoes and cut into 1/2-inch pieces. Add to stew (after 1 hour) and simmer, uncovered, until potatoes and lamb are tender, about 30 minutes more. Remove from heat and stir in currants, oregano, and lemon juice. Season with salt.
Serve sprinkled with additional Maras and Urfa pepper.

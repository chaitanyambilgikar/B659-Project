Heat olive oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add sliced garlic and stir 30 seconds. Add red onion slices and sauté until beginning to soften, about 5 minutes. Add all peppers and sauté until crisp-tender, about 7 minutes. Stir in Sherry wine vinegar, then olives. Season salad generously with salt and pepper. Cool completely. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Bring to room temperature before serving.)

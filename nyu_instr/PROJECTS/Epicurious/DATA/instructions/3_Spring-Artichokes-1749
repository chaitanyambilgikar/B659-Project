Bring large pot of water to boil. Add bay leaves. Squeeze in juice from 1 lemon half; add lemon half and artichokes. Cover and simmer until leaves easily pull away from artichokes, about 45 minutes. Drain. Let artichokes cool.
Bring medium pot of water to boil. Squeeze in juice of remaining lemon half. Add celery root and boil until tender, about 2 minutes. Drain. Transfer celery root to medium bowl. Add chopped tomato, arugula and prosciutto to celery root. Place Dijon mustard in small bowl. Gradually mix in 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, then 6 tablespoons olive oil. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Stir half of dressing into celery root salad; reserve remainder for artichokes. (Can be prepared 6 hours ahead. Cover artichokes and celery root salad separately and refrigerate. Let dressing stand at room temperature.)
Remove inner light-green leaves from artichokes. Using spoon, scoop out choke. Fill center of each artichoke with some celery root salad. Place artichokes on plates. Surround with remaining salad. Drizzle reserved dressing over artichokes and serve.

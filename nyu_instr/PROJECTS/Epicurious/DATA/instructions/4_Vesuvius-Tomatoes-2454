Preheat oven to 250°F. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add onions and sauté until tender, about 8 minutes. Place tomatoes in single layer in large roasting pan. Add onions, 1/2 cup oil, garlic, basil, salt, sugar and red pepper; toss to coat. Roast until tomatoes are tender but not falling apart, stirring occasionally, about 2 hours.

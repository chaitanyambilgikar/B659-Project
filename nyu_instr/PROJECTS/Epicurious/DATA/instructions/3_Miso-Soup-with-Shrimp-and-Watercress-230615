Bring first 4 ingredients to boil in heavy medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add carrots. Reduce heat to low; cover and simmer until carrots are crisp-tender, about 3 minutes.
Place miso in medium bowl. Whisk in 1/2 cup hot broth mixture. Return miso-broth mixture to same saucepan. (Can be made 2 hours ahead. Cover and let stand at room temperature.)
Bring soup to boil. Turn off heat. Mix in shrimp, watercress, and green onions. Cover and let stand until shrimp are cooked through, about 4 minutes. Stir in chili oil; divide soup equally among 4 bowls and serve.

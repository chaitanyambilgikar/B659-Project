Whisk together yogurt, lemon juice, garlic, turmeric, and 1 teaspoon salt in a large bowl, then add chicken, stirring to coat. Marinate, covered and chilled, at least 8 hours.
If using a charcoal grill, open vents on bottom of grill, then light charcoal. When charcoal turns grayish white and you can hold your hand 5 inches above grill rack for 3 to 4 seconds, grill is ready (medium-hot). If using a gas grill, preheat burners on high, covered, 10 minutes, then reduce heat to medium-high.
While grill heats, drain chicken, discarding marinade, and thread chicken pieces about 1/4 inch apart onto skewers.
Lightly oil hot grill rack, then grill kebabs, covered only if using a gas grill, turning occasionally, until chicken is just cooked through, 4 to 6 minutes.

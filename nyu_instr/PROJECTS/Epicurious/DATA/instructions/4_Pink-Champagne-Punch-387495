Bring water, sugar, and lemon zest to a boil in a 1-quart saucepan, stirring to dissolve sugar, then boil 5 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and add pomegranate and lemon juice, then chill until very cold, at least 1 hour.
Just before serving, pour pomegranate syrup into a 2-quart glass pitcher and add champagne.

for caper sauce: Whisk all ingredients in medium bowl. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
for crab cakes: Combine crabmeat, 1 cup breadcrumbs, and next five ingredients in large bowl. Spread 2 1/2 cups breadcrumbs on rimmed baking sheet. Using 1/4-cup capacity ice-cream scoop, form crab mixture into 24 small balls. Flatten slightly. Coat crab cakes in breadcrumbs, transfer to another baking sheet. Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours and up to 1 day.
Heat 1/2 cup oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Working in batches, fry crab cakes until brown, adding more oil to skillet as needed, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer 2 crab cakes to each of 12 plates. Serve, passing caper sauce alongside.

In small bowl, whisk together sugar and 1/4 cup hot water until sugar is dissolved. Stir in lime juice and zest. Cover and refrigerate until cool, about 1 1/2 hours. (Syrup can be made ahead and chilled, covered, up to 3 days.)
In 1 very large or 2 medium plastic containers, combine melon wedges. Refrigerate until cold, about 1 1/2 hours. (Melons can be sliced and chilled up to 12 hours ahead.)
As close to serving time as possible, stir mint into syrup and drizzle over melon wedges. Serve chilled.

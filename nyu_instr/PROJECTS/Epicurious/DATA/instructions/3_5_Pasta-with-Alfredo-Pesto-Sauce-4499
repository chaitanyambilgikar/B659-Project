Finely chop basil, pine nuts and garlic in processor. With machine running, gradually add olive oil through feed tube and process until smooth. Mix in 1/2 Parmesan. Transfer pesto to small jar. (Can be prepared 4 days ahead. Pour enough olive oil over sauce to cover. Cover and refrigerate.)
Bring cream to boil in heavy medium saucepan. Whisk in pesto. Season sauce and remaining 1/2 cup Parmesan in large bowl. Toss to coat pasta evenly and serve.

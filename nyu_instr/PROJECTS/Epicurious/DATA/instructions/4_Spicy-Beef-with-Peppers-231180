Cut steak with grain into 1 1/2- to 2-inch-wide strips. Cut each strip across grain into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Put slices into a medium bowl with soy sauce, cornstarch, rice wine, garlic, ginger, 1/4 teaspoon salt, sugar, and 1 teaspoon oil and stir with a fork. 3Stir together ketchup, hoisin, and chile garlic sauce in a small bowl.
Heat wok over high heat until a bead of water vaporizes within 1 to 2 seconds of contact. Pour 2 teaspoons oil down side of wok, then swirl oil, tilting wok to coat sides. Add beef, spreading pieces in 1 layer on bottom and sides as quickly as possible. Cook, undisturbed, letting beef begin to brown, 1 minute, then stir-fry until meat is just browned on all sides but still pink in center, about 1 minute. Transfer meat and any juices to a plate.
Pour remaining 2 teaspoons oil down side of unwashed wok over high heat, then swirl oil, tilting wok to coat sides. Add bell pepper, scallions, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt. Stir-fry 30 seconds, then add reserved beef with any juices and ketchup mixture. Stir-fry until combined well and sauce thickens slightly, about 30 seconds, then transfer to a platter.

Peel potatoes. Cut each into 6 wedges. Transfer to a 3-quart saucepan and cover by 1 inch with cold water. Bring potatoes to a boil, then simmer, uncovered, until potatoes are tender when pierced with a sharp knife, 8 to 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, mince garlic, then mash to a paste with a pinch of salt using a large heavy knife. Transfer to a small bowl, then whisk in oil, 3 tablespoons mint, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.
Coarsely grate eggs into a bowl using 1/4-inch holes of a box grater, then toss with remaining tablespoon mint and salt and pepper to taste.
When potatoes are almost finished cooking, cook snap peas with remaining 2 teaspoons salt in a 2- to 3-quart saucepan of boiling water 1 minute, then drain. Drain potatoes and toss with vinegar, then add snap peas and oil mixture and stir to combine. Transfer to a serving bowl and sprinkle with egg mint mimosa.

Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add sausage and sauté until browned, about 6 minutes. Add 6 cups onions, 4 cups celery, and 2 cups bell peppers; sauté until vegetables are brown, about 20 minutes. Add remaining onions, celery, and bell peppers, then thyme and cayenne; sauté until vegetables begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cool slightly. Cover and chill.)
Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter 15x10x2-inch glass baking dish. Whisk eggs and 1/2 cup broth in medium bowl. Crumble cornbread into very large bowl. Add vegetable and egg-broth mixtures; toss. Mix in more broth by 1/4 cupfuls if dressing is dry. Transfer dressing to prepared dish. Drizzle with butter.
Bake dressing uncovered until golden brown and slightly crisp on top, about 45 minutes.

Cut radishes into very thin slices (preferably using a manual slicer). Tear large lettuce leaves into bite-size pieces, leaving smaller leaves whole, and in a large bowl toss all lettuce with radishes.
In a small bowl whisk together lemon juice, shallot, sugar, pepper, and salt to taste and add oil in a stream, whisking until emulsified. Drizzle dressing over salad and toss until combined well.

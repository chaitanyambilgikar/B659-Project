1. Prepare the pie dough, divide half and roll out each half no more than 1/4 inch thick. Line a 9-inch pie pan with one. Keep lined pan and top crust chilled.
2. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Peel and core the apples and slice them about 1/4 inch thick. Toss with sugar and cinnamon to taste and with the flour. Fill the pie with the apple slices, mounding them somewhat in the center. Dot with butter. Cover loosely with the top crust, using a little water to seal the crusts together. Crimp the edges. Using a fork or the tip of a knife, make several vents in the top crust.
3. Place in the preheated oven and bake for 1 hour or until golden brown. The smell will tell you when it is ready. Serve while still warm.

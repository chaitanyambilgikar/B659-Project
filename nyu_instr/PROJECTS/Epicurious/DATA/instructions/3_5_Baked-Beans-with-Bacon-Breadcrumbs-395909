Preheat oven to 350°F. Heat oil in a large heavy wide pot over high heat; add ham, onion, and garlic. Cook, stirring often, until onion caramelizes, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low. Add ketchup, next 6 ingredients, and 4 cups water to pot; season to taste with salt and pepper. Let sauce simmer until slightly thickened, 10–15 minutes. Stir beans into sauce.
Cover and bake beans until juices are bubbly and thickened, about 2 hours.
Meanwhile, place bacon slices on a rimmed baking sheet. Roast in oven until crisp, 10-15 minutes. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Let bacon cool and reserve 1 tablespoon bacon drippings separately.
Coarsely crumble bacon; place in a food processor with reserved drippings and panko; pulse until bacon is finely chopped. Season with salt and pepper.
Remove beans from oven. Preheat broiler. Sprinkle beans with bacon breadcrumbs. Broil, uncovered, until crumbs are golden brown, 8–10 minutes.

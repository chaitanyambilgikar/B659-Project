Divide strawberries between 2 bowls or large wineglasses. Whisk egg yolks, Grand Marnier, 2 tablespoons water, and sugar in medium metal bowl. Set bowl over large saucepan of gently simmering water (do not allow bottom of bowl to touch water). Whisk until mixture becomes thick and foamy, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat; whisk 1 minute longer. Whisk in crème fraîche. Spoon warm zabaglione over strawberries. Garnish with mint sprigs. Serve immediately.

Preheat broiler.
Rinse salmon and pat dry. Arrange salmon, skin side down, in a foil-lined jelly-roll pan and rub thoroughly with soy sauce. Season salmon with salt and pepper and broil about 4 inches from heat 12 to 15 minutes, or until just cooked through. Transfer salmon to a platter and garnish with herbs.
Serve salmon warm or at room temperature with mustard dill sauce.

Prepare your cooker to cook indirectly at 235°F using medium hickory wood for smoke flavor.
Lay the ham cut-side down on a cutting board. With a sharp knife, score the skin in a diamond pattern on all sides. Place the ham in the cooker with the cut side down and cook for 2 hours.
To make the glaze: In the large bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade, combine the apricots, ketchup, soy sauce, and molasses. Process for about 15 seconds, until the mixture is smooth. Transfer the glaze to a bowl and set aside.
After the ham has cooked for 2 hours, brush it all over with a heavy coating of the glaze. Cook for 30 minutes and glaze the ham again. Cook for an additional 30 minutes.
Transfer the ham to a platter and tent loosely with aluminum foil. Let rest for 15 minutes. Slice to serve.

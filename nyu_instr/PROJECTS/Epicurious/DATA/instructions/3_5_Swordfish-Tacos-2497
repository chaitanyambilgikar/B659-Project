Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat) or preheat broiler. Brush swordfish generously with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill or broil until just cooked through, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer steaks to plate and cut into chunks. Serve swordfish with corn tortillas, lime wedges, cabbage, Pico de Gallo and sour cream, allowing guests to assemble their own tacos.
Make the Pico de Gallo: Combine all ingredients in bowl. Season to taste with salt. (Can be prepared 6 hours ahead. Store at room temperature.)

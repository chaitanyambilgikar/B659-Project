Line rimmed baking sheet with parchment. Divide dough into 4 equal pieces. Roll 1 piece on lightly floured surface into 24-inch-long rope. Cut rope into 1-inch pieces. Holding gnocchi in palm, roll whisk over each to form indentations. Transfer gnocchi to prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough.

Meanwhile, melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in large skillet; set aside. Working in 2 batches, cook gnocchi in large pot of boiling salted water until they float to surface, then cook 1 minute longer.

Stir first 4 ingredients in large saucepan over medium heat just until sugar dissolves. Strain into bowl, pressing on solids; mix in Champagne. Pour 2 cups juice mixture into medium saucepan. Refrigerate remaining juice mixture in bowl. Simmer mixture in saucepan until reduced to 3/4 cup, stirring occasionally, about 25 minutes. Refrigerate reduced mixture to use as sauce. Transfer juice mixture in bowl to ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturer's instructions. Transfer sorbet to container; cover and freeze. (Sauce and sorbet can be prepared 3 days ahead.)

Heat large pot over medium-high heat. Add bacon and onion; sauté until bacon is crisp around edges and onion starts to brown, stirring, about 8 minutes. Add garlic; stir 1 minute. Add tomatoes with juice and peppers; bring to boil, scraping up browned bits. Add clams, cover, and boil until clams open, stirring occasionally, 8 to 10 minutes (discard any clams that do not open). Stir in 1/4 cup parsley. Divide among shallow bowls. Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons parsley.

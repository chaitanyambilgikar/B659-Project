Preheat oven to 325°F.
In a small bowl combine broth or water and saffron.
Thinly slice enough onion to measure 1 1/2 cups and finely chop garlic. Remove casings from chorizo and cut sausage into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Peel tomatoes *(see below) and seed. Cut enough tomato into 1/4-inch dice to measure 1 1/2 cups.
With poultry shears or a sharp knife cut off necks, feet, and first 2 wing joints of each quail and discard. Pat quail dry and season with pepper and salt. In a 12-inch heavy skillet heat butter and corn or canola oil over moderately high heat until foam subsides. Add quail, breast sides down, and brown on all sides, 5 to 7 minutes total. Transfer quail to a plate.
In a large shallow flameproof kettle with a tight-fitting lid cook onion in olive oil over moderate heat, stirring, until pale golden. Add garlic and chorizo and cook, stirring, until garlic is softened but not browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Add cumin, oregano, and bay leaf or leaves and cook, stirring, 30 seconds. Add saffron mixture, tomato, and pepper and salt to taste and bring to a simmer.
Add quail to chorizo mixture and braise, covered, in middle of oven, basting every 15 minutes, 1 hour total. While quail is braising, roast and peel poblanos . Wearing rubber gloves, cut chiles into thin strips. Chop cilantro.
Arrange quail on a platter and keep warm. Discard bay leaf and skim any fat from chorizo mixture, if desired. Stir in chiles, cilantro, and salt to taste and bring mixture to a boil.
Spoon chorizo mixture around quail and serve with lime wedges and polenta or rice.
To peel tomatoes: Have ready a bowl of ice and cold water. Cut an X in blossom end of each tomato. In a saucepan of boiling water blanch tomatoes 10 seconds. Transfer tomatoes with a slotted spoon to ice water to stop cooking. Peel tomatoes.

Prepare custard mix according to package instructions. Place in freezer until cold, stirring often, about 15 minutes.
Mix preserves and 1/4 cup reserved raspberry syrup in small bowl. Line bottom of 8-inch-diameter glass bowl that is 4 to 5 inches deep (about 15-cup capacity) with layer of cake, trimming to fit. Brush 1/4 cup Sherry over. Spread 1/4 cup preserve mixture over. Reserve 12 raspberries. Sprinkle 1/3 cup raspberries over preserves, then pour 1 cup custard over. Repeat layering 2 more times. Cover; chill 2 hours. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Keep chilled.)
Beat cream in large bowl until stiff peaks form. Spoon cream onto trifle. Garnish with 12 raspberries.

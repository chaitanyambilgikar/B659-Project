Whisk first 3 ingredients in medium bowl to blend. Season vinaigrette to taste with salt and pepper.
Cook brussels sprouts in large pot of boiling salted water until crisp-tender, about 8 minutes. Drain. Transfer to bowl of ice water to cool. Drain well; pat dry. Cut brussels sprouts in half lengthwise and place in large bowl. (Vinaigrette and brussels sprouts can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover separately; chill. Bring both to room temperature; rewhisk vinaigrette before continuing.)
Toss brussels sprouts with enough vinaigrette to coat. Transfer to deep platter; spoon any remaining vinaigrette over. Sprinkle with blue cheese and Glazed Pecans.

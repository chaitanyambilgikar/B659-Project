Lightly oil a 12-inch square of foil. In a heavy saucepan boil 1 1/4 cups sugar and 1/4 cup water over moderate heat, stirring, until sugar is dissolved. Boil syrup without stirring, washing down sugar crystals on side of pan with a brush dipped in cold water, until pale golden. Continue cooking syrup without stirring, swirling pan, until deep golden. Immediately pour caramel onto foil and cool completely, about 20 minutes. Break caramel into shards. Shards keep, layered between sheets of wax paper, in an airtight container at room temperature 1 day. Recommended for garnish on chocolate and coffee desserts.

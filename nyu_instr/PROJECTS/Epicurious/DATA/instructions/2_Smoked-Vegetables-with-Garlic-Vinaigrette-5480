Prepare barbecue (medium heat). Toss garlic with 1 tablespoon oil in small bowl. Wrap garlic in foil, enclosing completely. Transfer to grill and cook until garlic is tender, about 25 minutes. Cool.
Place smoke chips in 8 x 6-inch foil packet with open top. Set atop coals 5 minutes before grilling vegetables. Meanwhile, combine vegetables in large bowl. Toss with 3 tablespoons oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill until crisp-tender and golden, turning occasionally, about 8 minutes. Cool to room temperature. Cut into 1/2-inch pieces. Transfer to large bowl.
Press garlic to release from skins. Place garlic in processor. Add vinegar and 3 tablespoons olive oil. Blend until almost smooth. Season with salt and pepper. (Vegetables and vinaigrette can be made up to 2 hours ahead. Cover separately. Let vegetables stand at room temperature. Chill vinaigrette.)
Toss vegetables with enough vinaigrette to coat. Season with salt and pepper.

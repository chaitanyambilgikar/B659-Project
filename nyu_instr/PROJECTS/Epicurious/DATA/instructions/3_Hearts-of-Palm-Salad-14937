In a bowl whisk together mayonnaise and vinegar until smooth. Cut peel and pith from tangerine and, holding fruit over a small bowl (to catch juice) cut sections free from membranes, discarding seeds.
Rinse and drain hearts of palm and diagonally cut into 3/4-inch-thick slices. Pit and peel avocado and cut into 10inch pieces. Tear arugula into bite-size pieces and add to dressing with tangerine and juice, hearts of palm, and avocado.
Toss salad to coat with dressing and season with salt and pepper.

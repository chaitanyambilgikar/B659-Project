Heat 3 tablespoon oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium heat until it shimmers, then cook eggplant with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper, stirring occasionally, until browned, about 5 minutes.
Stir together tomato paste, sugar, water, and vinegar and add to eggplant with 1/3 cup scallions, then braise, covered, over medium heat until eggplant is tender, about 12 minutes.
While eggplant braises, gently mix veal, dill, remaining 1/3 cup scallions, 3/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a large bowl, then form into 4 (4-inch) cakes.
Heat remaining 3 tablespoons oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until hot. Dredge veal cakes in flour, shaking off excess, then fry, turning once, until golden-brown, 8 to 12 minutes total for medium. 3Divide eggplant among 4 plates and top with veal cakes.

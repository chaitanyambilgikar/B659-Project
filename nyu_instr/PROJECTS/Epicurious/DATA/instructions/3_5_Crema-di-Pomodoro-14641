Preheat oven to 350°F.
Cut enough bread into 3/4-inch cubes to measure about 3 cups and arrange in one layer in a shallow baking pan. Toast bread in middle of oven until golden and crisp, 10 to 15 minutes.
Finely chop carrots, celery, onion, and garlic. In a heavy 4- to 5-quart kettle cook chopped vegetables and garlic in oil with salt and pepper to taste over moderately low heat, stirring, until tender but not browned, about 10 minutes. Add wine and boil 3 minutes. Add tomatoes, oregano, and 1 cup water and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, 20 minutes. Remove kettle from heat and whisk in heavy cream and sour cream. Cool soup 10 minutes. In a blender puree soup in batches (use caution when blending hot liquids), transferring as pureed to a large bowl. Return soup to kettle and thin to desired consistency with remaining water. Season soup with salt and pepper and heat over moderate heat, stirring, until heated through (do not let boil).
Serve soup ladled over croutons in large bowls.

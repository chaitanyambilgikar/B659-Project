Chop the arugula fine and in a bowl stir it together with the mozzarella, the tomatoes, and salt and pepper to taste. Grill the bread on a rack set 4 inches over glowing coals, turning it once, until it is golden. (Alternatively, the bread may be toasted on a rack in a preheated broiler about 4 inches from the heat, turning it once.) Rub the toasts with the garlic on one side and brush the same side with half the oil. Spoon the arugula mixture onto the oiled sides of the toasts and drizzle the remaining 2 tablespoons oil over it.

Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 325°F.
Toast almonds in a large shallow baking pan until pale golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool, then toss with cornflakes in a large bowl.
Line bottom of cooled baking pan with foil, then lightly oil foil.
Whisk together egg white, 3 tablespoons sugar, and salt in a small bowl, then add to cornflake mixture and toss gently to coat well. Arrange mixture in pan in a thin, even layer and sprinkle with remaining sugar. Bake until nuts and coating are golden, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool completely in pan on a rack. Peel off foil and break into pieces.

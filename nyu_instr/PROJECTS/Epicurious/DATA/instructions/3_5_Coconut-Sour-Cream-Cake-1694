Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter 13x9x2-inch baking pan. Dust pan with flour. Combine 1 cup sour cream, 3/4 cup cream of coconut, eggs, vegetable oil and fresh lemon juice in large bowl and whisk to blend. Add white cake mix and blend well. Transfer batter to prepared pan.
Bake cake until top is golden brown and tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 35 minutes.
Meanwhile, blend remaining 1/4 cup sour cream and remaining 1/4 cup cream of coconut in small bowl. Spread mixture evenly over warm cake. Return cake to oven; bake 5 minutes longer. Sprinkle coconut over. Place pan on rack and cool cake completely.

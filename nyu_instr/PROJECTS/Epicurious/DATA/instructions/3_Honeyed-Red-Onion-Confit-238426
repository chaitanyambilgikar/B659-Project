Heat oil in a 3- to 4-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat until hot but not smoking, then cook onions, stirring occasionally, until they begin to soften, about 7 minutes. Add raisins, honey, ginger, and cinnamon and cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until onions are very tender and slightly caramelized, 20 to 25 minutes.

Milton's method Wash and boil the sliced potatoes in salted water for about four minutes until they are slightly softened but still firm. Drain them and set aside.
In a medium-sized, non-stick, ovenproof frying pan (no plastic handle!) heat a little oil, and fry the bacon and sausages over medium-high heat for about six or seven minutes, stirring occasionally, until the ingredients begin to turn crispy and take on a golden brown color.
Add the mushrooms, along with the potatoes, stirring them in carefully so that the potatoes don’t break up. Fry for another four minutes or so, until the potatoes start to golden.
Add the onion, fry for a couple more minutes and then add the sweet pepper, sweet paprika and thyme leaves. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Let everything cook for another two minutes, stirring to prevent burning.
Make sure the ingredients are evenly distributed, then reduce the heat to low-medium and pour in the eggs, tilting the pan and moving the ingredients around gently with a wooden spoon so the egg mixture reaches all corners of the pan. Leave it to cook gently for about six minutes or until the egg in contact with the base of the pan has set (you should then be able lift the tortilla away from the sides of the pan and slide it around).
Put the pan in a pre-heated broiler for five minutes until the egg on top has set.
Cut in half and serve with buttered toast and condiments of your choice; I like to have a couple of pickled chilis with this.

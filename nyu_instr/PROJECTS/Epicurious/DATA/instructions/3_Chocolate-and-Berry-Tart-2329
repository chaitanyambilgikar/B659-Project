Preheat oven to 350°F. Roll out pastry on floured surface to 14x11-inch rectangle. Trim two 1-inch-wide strips off each edge (for a total of 8 strips) and reserve. Transfer pastry rectangle to ungreased baking sheet. Pierce rectangle all over with fork. Brush with glaze. Arrange 1 pastry strip atop each edge of rectangle, trimming to join strips at corners. Brush with glaze. Top each edge with remaining pastry strips, covering corner seams and trimming to square off. Brush with glaze. Sprinkle with sugar. Bake 5 minutes. Pierce pastry rectangle (not sides) all over with fork. Continue baking until golden, about 20 minutes longer. Cool on rack.

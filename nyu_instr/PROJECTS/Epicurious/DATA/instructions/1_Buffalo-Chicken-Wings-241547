1. Cut the carrots and celery into sticks; set aside.
2. Using a sharp knife, separate the chicken wings at the joint so you have a "drumstick" and a "thigh." Set aside.
3. Melt the butter with the Tabasco sauce in a small saucepan. Transfer it to a large bowl and set aside.
4. Heat the peanut and vegetable oils in a deep, heavy pot over medium-high heat. When the oils are hot, cook the chicken in batches until golden brown and cooked through, about 10 minutes. Remove with tongs and drain on paper towels. Place in the bowl and toss with the Tabasco mixture to coat. Season with salt and pepper.
5. Serve the wings immediately with the carrot and celery sticks and dip alongside

Preheat oven to 350°F.
Make crust: In a food processor blend together flour, sugar, and butter until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add 2 tablespoons water and toss until incorporated. Add enough remaining water if necessary until mixture begins to come together but is still crumbly.
Press crust evenly onto bottom and sides of an 11-inch tart pan with removable fluted rim. Prick crust with a fork and bake in middle of oven until golden, about 30 minutes.
Make filling while crust bakes: In a bowl with an electric mixer beat together cream cheese, sugar, vanilla, and egg until smooth. Add flour and blend mixture well.
Pour filling into warm crust, spreading evenly, and bake in middle of oven until set, about 20 minutes. Cool tart in pan on a rack.
In a small saucepan heat jam with water over moderate heat, stirring, until melted and smooth. Remove pan from heat and cool jam slightly. Arrange raspberries decoratively on top of tart and brush gently with jam.

Heat oven to 450°F. Bring edamame to a boil in a medium saucepan with enough water to cover; cook, stirring occasionally, about 3 minutes. Drain in a colander and run under cold water. Bake pita triangles on a baking sheet until golden, 3 to 5 minutes. Pulse edamame, garlic, tahini, juice, oil, salt, cumin and pepper in a food processor until mixture is the consistency of guacamole; add water 1 tablespoon at a time if too thick. Cover; refrigerate until party time. Serve with pita toasts and peppers for dipping.

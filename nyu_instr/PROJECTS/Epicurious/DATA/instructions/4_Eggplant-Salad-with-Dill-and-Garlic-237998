In several large colanders set over bowls, toss eggplant cubes with salt. Let stand 1 hour to drain.
Meanwhile, using tongs or long-handled fork, hold peppers over open flame, turning until blackened on all sides, 2 to 3 minutes. (Alternatively, on rack of broiler pan under preheated broiler about 2 inches from heat, broil peppers, turning every 5 minutes, until skins are blistered and charred, 15 to 25 minutes.) Transfer to large bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and let stand 15 minutes. Peel, seed, and dice.
Rinse eggplant under cold water and blot dry with paper towels. In large heavy skillet over moderately high heat, heat 3 tablespoons olive oil until hot but not smoking. Working in 3 batches and using 3 tablespoons oil for each batch, sauté eggplant and garlic until tender, about 5 minutes. Drain on paper towels.
Transfer eggplant and garlic to large bowl. Add peppers, dill, vinegar, and sugar and toss to combine. Chill overnight. Serve cold or at room temperature, accompanied by matzoh.

For crust: Preheat oven to 350°F. Finely grind amaretti cookies in processor (makes about 1 1/2 cups crumbs). With processor running, gradually add melted butter and process until crumbs begin to stick together. Press crust mixture onto bottom and up sides of 9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom. Bake crust until pale golden, about 6 minutes. Cool. Gently press up bottom of pan just to loosen crust from sides (do not remove from pan). Place crust in freezer.
For filling: Soak currants in 1/2 cup Marsala in small bowl for 1 hour.
Whisk remaining 1 cup Marsala, sugar and yolks in large metal bowl. Set bowl over saucepan of rapidly simmering water and whisk until candy thermometer inserted into mixture registers 170°F, about 4 minutes. Remove bowl from over water. Whisk in corn syrup, vanilla and nutmeg. Refrigerate zabaglione until cool, whisking occasionally, about 20 minutes.
Beat cream in bowl to stiff peaks. Add zabaglione and beat just until smooth. Drain currants and fold into zabaglione (reserve Marsala for another use). Place in freezer until slightly stiffened but not frozen, about 1 hour.
Spoon zabaglione cream into crust, mounding in center. Freeze until almost firm, about 2 hours. Cover and freeze until firm, at least 6 hours or overnight.
For sauce: Stir Marsala and sugar in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat and boil until syrup is reduced to generous 2/3 cup, about 17 minutes. Add lemon peel and nutmeg and boil 1 minute. Cool slightly. (Can be prepared 8 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature. Rewarm over low heat before serving.)
Remove tart from pan. Transfer tart to platter. Arrange strawberries around top edge of tart. Cut into wedges. Serve, passing warm sauce separately.

Heat 2 tablespoons oil in large skillet over medium-low heat. Add zucchini; sauté until almost tender, about 3 minutes. Stir in tomatoes and minced rosemary. Sauté until zucchini are tender, about 2 minutes longer. Season with salt and pepper.
Meanwhile, cook shrimp in large pot of boiling salted water until opaque in center, about 4 minutes. Drain shrimp. Spoon zucchini mixture onto plates. Top with shrimp. Drizzle 1 teaspoon oil over each serving. Garnish with rosemary sprigs and serve.

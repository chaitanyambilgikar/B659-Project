1. In a large stockpot, combine the mushrooms, celery, onion, white wine, lemon juice, parsley stems, fish bones, and water. Place the pot over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, without stirring, for 30 minutes.
2. Add the bay leaves, peppercorns, and thyme to the pot and continue simmering for an additional 15 minutes.
3. Gently skim off and discard any foam that may be on the surface. Gently strain the stock through a fine mesh sieve. Use immediately or chill in an ice bath and store in the refrigerator, covered, until ready to serve.

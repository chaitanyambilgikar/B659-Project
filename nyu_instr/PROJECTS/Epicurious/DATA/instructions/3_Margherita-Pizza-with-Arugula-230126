To make sauce, combine tomatoes, basil, garlic, and 1 tbsp oil in a medium-sized bowl. Stir well and set aside for up to 1 hour. Mix cheeses together in a bowl. In a separate bowl, combine arugula, remaining 2 tbsp oil, and vinegar. Season with salt and pepper. Make crust. While second side of each crust is grilling, spread 1/8 cheese mixture over cooked side of each crust; dollop each with1/3 cup sauce. (Do not spread.) Top with arugula. Rotate 3 to 4 minutes until bottom is golden brown.

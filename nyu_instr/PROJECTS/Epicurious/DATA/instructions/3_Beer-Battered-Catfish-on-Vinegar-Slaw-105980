Whisk 1/3 cup flour, salt, and pepper in medium bowl to blend. Whisk in beer.
Add enough oil to heavy large skillet to reach depth of 1/2 inch. Heat oil to 350°F. Place remaining 2 tablespoons flour on plate. Coat fish with flour. Dip in batter, letting excess drip off. Fry fish until golden brown and crisp, about 4 minutes per side. Drain fish on paper towels.
Toss coleslaw mix, vinegar, honey, and 1 tablespoon oil in medium bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Divide between plates. Place fish atop coleslaw.

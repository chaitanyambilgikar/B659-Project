Preheat oven to 350°F.
Cut bread on a long diagonal into 1/8- to 1/4-inch-thick slices with a serrated knife and arrange in 1 layer on 3 large baking sheets. Brush top of each slice with some oil.
Bake slices 1 sheet at a time in middle of oven until golden and crisp, 15 to 17 minutes. Sprinkle toasts lightly with kosher salt and cool on sheets on racks.

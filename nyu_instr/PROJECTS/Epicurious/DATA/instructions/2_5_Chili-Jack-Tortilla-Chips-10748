Brush the tortillas lightly on one side with the oil. In a small bowl combine well the chili powder, the salt, and the orégano, sprinkle the mixture over the tortillas, and scatter the Monterey Jack on top. Cut each tortilla into fourths with a pizza wheel or sharp knife, arrange the wedges on 2 large baking sheets, and bake them in a preheated 400°F. oven for 12 to 15 minutes, or until they are golden and crisp.

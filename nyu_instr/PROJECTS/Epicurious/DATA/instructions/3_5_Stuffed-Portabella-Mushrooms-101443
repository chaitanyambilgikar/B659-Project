Preheat broiler.
In a small bowl stir together bread crumbs, Parmesan, parsley, and salt and pepper to taste. Cut off and discard mushroom stems. Put mushrooms, gill sides down, on a baking sheet and brush tops with 1/2 tablespoon oil. Broil mushrooms 2 to 3 inches from heat until golden, about 3 minutes. Turn mushrooms over and season with salt and pepper. Broil mushrooms 3 minutes more. Mound bread-crumb mixture onto mushroom centers and drizzle with remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil. Broil stuffed mushrooms until stuffing is golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes.

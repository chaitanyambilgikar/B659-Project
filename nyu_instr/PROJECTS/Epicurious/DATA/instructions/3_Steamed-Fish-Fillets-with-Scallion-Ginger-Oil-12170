Arrange the fillets in one layer in a microwave-safe baking dish, season them with salt and pepper, and cover the dish tightly with microwave-safe plastic wrap. Microwave the fish at high power (100%) for 3 minutes, or until it is opaque and just cooked through, remove the plastic wrap carefully, and pour off the liquid in the dish. Keep the fish warm, covered loosely.
In a microwave-safe glass measure combine the vegetable oil, the gingerroot, and scallion and microwave the mixture at high power (100%) for 1 minute. Add the sesame oil, let the mixture cool slightly, and pour it over fish. Serve the fish sprinkled with soy sauce and the vinegar.

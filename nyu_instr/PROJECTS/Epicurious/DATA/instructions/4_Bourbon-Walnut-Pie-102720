For crust: Blend flour, sugar and salt in processor. Add butter and process using on/off turns until mixture resembles coarse meal. Whisk egg and milk in small bowl to blend, then add to processor. Blend until moist clumps form. Gather dough into ball and flatten into disk. Wrap dough in plastic and refrigerate 1 hour. (Dough can be prepared up to 2 days ahead. Keep refrigerated. Let dough soften slightly before rolling out.)
For filling: Preheat oven to 350°F. Whisk syrup, sugar, eggs, butter, bourbon, flour, vanilla and salt in large bowl to blend. Mix in all walnuts.
Roll out dough on floured surface to 14-inch round. Transfer to 9-inch-diameter glass pie dish. Fold edge under; crimp decoratively. Pour filling into prepared crust. Bake until crust is golden and filling is set in center when pie is shaken slightly, about 55 minutes. Cool pie completely in pan on rack.

Preheat oven to 425°F. Whisk olive oil, lemon juice, shallots, oregano, parsley and garlic in medium bowl to blend. Season vinaigrette with salt and pepper.
Toss potatoes with 1/2 cup vinaigrette on heavy large rimmed baking sheet. Reserve remaining vinaigrette for serving. Pour chicken stock around potatoes. Sprinkle potatoes with salt and pepper. Roast potatoes until tender and golden brown, turning occasionally, about 45 minutes. Cool completely. Using metal spatula, loosen potatoes from baking sheet to prevent sticking. (Can be prepared 3 hours ahead. Let stand on baking sheet at room temperature.)
Preheat oven to 425°F. Rewarm potatoes until crisp, about 15 minutes. Divide potatoes equally among plates. Drizzle some reserved lemon vinaigrette over potatoes.

Pour enough vegetable oil into medium skillet to reach depth of 3/4 inch. Heat oil over medium heat to 350°F. Add 1/4 of tortilla strips to skillet and cook until crisp and light golden, about 45 seconds. Using tongs or slotted spoon, transfer tortilla strips to paper towels to drain. Sprinkle with coarse salt and ancho chile powder. Repeat with remaining tortilla strips in 3 batches. Cool.

For spice oil: Grind first 4 ingredients and 1/2 teaspoon salt to a fine powder in spice mill. Transfer to a small saucepan over medium-low heat; add oil. Cook until oil begins to simmer, 2-3 minutes. Scrape into a small bowl; stir in garlic and lemon zest. Let cool for 5 minutes, then stir in 1 tablespoon lemon juice. Season with salt, pepper, and more juice, if desired. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 week ahead. Cover; chill. Rewarm before using.
For scallops: Heat grapeseed oil in a large heavy skillet over high heat until oil begins to smoke. Season scallops with salt and pepper. Sear until well browned, about 3 minutes. Turn; cook until just barely opaque in center, about 30 seconds longer.
Meanwhile, place herbs in a medium bowl and drizzle olive oil and lemon juice over; season salad to taste with salt and pepper. Divide scallops between 2 plates; spoon 1 tablespoon spice oil over each plate (reserve remaining oil for another use). Garnish with salad.

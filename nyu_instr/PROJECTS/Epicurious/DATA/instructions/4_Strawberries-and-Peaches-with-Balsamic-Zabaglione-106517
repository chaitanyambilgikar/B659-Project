1. To make the zabaglione: In a medium bowl, whip the heavy cream to stiff peaks. Cover and refrigerate.
2. In a stainless-steel bowl, whisk the egg yolks with the sugar, vin santo, and balsamic vinegar. Place the bowl over a saucepan of simmering water or transfer to the top of a double boiler and whisk vigorously, using a balloon whisk. Continue whisking over the simmering water until the mixture is thick and foamy. Remove the bowl from the heat and continue whisking until the zabaglione is completely cool. Gently fold the zabaglione into the whipped cream and chill for 30 minutes.
3. While the zabaglione is chilling, place the strawberries and peaches in a large bowl. In a small saucepan, combine the vin santo, honey, and sugar and bring to a boil. Stir to completely dissolve the sugar, then cook the mixture until reduced slightly. Pour the hot syrup over the fruit and toss to coat. Spoon the fruit into dessert dishes or wine glasses and top with a dollop of the zabaglione.

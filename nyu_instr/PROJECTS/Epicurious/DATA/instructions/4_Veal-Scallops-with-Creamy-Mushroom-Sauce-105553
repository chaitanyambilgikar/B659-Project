Place flour in shallow dish. Sprinkle veal scallops with salt and pepper. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in heavy large skillet over high heat. Coat veal in flour, shaking off excess. Working in batches, add veal to skillet and sauté until beginning to brown, about 1 minute per side. Transfer to plate. Tent with foil to keep warm.
Melt remaining 3 tablespoons butter in same skillet over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms and shallots and sauté until mushrooms are brown and tender, about 7 minutes. Add wine; simmer until liquid is reduced to 1/4 cup. Add cream; simmer until reduced to sauce consistency, about 3 minutes. Season sauce with salt and pepper. Return veal to skillet; simmer until just heated through, about 1 minute. Transfer veal to plates, spooning sauce over. Sprinkle with parsley; serve.

In a saucepan combine all the sauce ingredients. Bring to a boil and reduce the heat. Simmer for 5-10 minutes until thick and pulpy.
In a large frying pan, cook the sausages over a low heat for about 20 minutes, turning occasionally until they are cooked through. If using hot dogs, cook in boiling water until heated through.
To serve, slice the rolls lengthwise. Place a sausage in each roll, and top with the sauce and grated cheese.

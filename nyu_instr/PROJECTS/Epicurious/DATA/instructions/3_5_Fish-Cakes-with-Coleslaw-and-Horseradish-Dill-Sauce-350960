Grate enough lemon peel to measure 2 1/2 teaspoons. Halve lemons; squeeze enough juice to measure 1/4 cup. Mix peel, 2 tablespoons juice, mayonnaise, 1/4 cup green onion, relish, horseradish, and 2 tablespoons dill in bowl; set sauce aside.
Grind bread to fine crumbs in processor. Place 1 cup breadcrumbs in medium bowl. Place remaining breadcrumbs in 13x9-inch baking dish. Using on/off turns, very coarsely chop fish in processor (do not form paste). Add fish to breadcrumbs in bowl; gently mix in egg, 1 tablespoon sauce, and 1/4 cup green onion. Shape fish mixture into four 31/2-inch-round cakes; thickly coat with breadcrumbs in baking dish.
Toss coleslaw mix, 3 tablespoons sauce, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, and 1 tablespoon dill in bowl. Season with salt and pepper.
Heat oil in large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add fish cakes; sauté until cooked through, about 2 minutes per side. Serve fish cakes with slaw and sauce.

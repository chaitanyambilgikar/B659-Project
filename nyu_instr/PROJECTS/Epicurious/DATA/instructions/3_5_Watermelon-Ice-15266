In a small saucepan simmer water with sugar, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Transfer syrup to a bowl set in a larger bowl of ice and cold water and stir syrup until cold.
Discard rind from watermelon and cut fruit into 1-inch chunks. In a blender purée watermelon, syrup, and lemon juice and pour through a fine sieve into a 9-inch square metal baking pan, pressing hard on solids. Freeze mixture, covered, until frozen, 6 to 8 hours, and up to 2 days. Just before serving, scrape watermelon ice with a fork to lighten texture and break up ice crystals. Makes about 5 cups, serving 6.

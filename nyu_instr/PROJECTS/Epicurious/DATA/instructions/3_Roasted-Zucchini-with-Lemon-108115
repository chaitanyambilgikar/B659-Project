Put 2 large shallow baking pans (preferably heavy; 1 inch deep) in upper and lower thirds of oven and preheat oven to 500°F.
Cut 5 (1/8-inch-thick) crosswise slices from middle of lemon and squeeze 1 teaspoon juice from remaining pieces. Whisk together oil, lemon juice, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl. Add zucchini and toss until coated.
Divide zucchini between preheated baking pans, spreading evenly in 1 layer, and roast in upper and lower thirds of oven until undersides are browned, about 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine lemon slices and sugar in bowl and toss to coat. Gently turn zucchini slices over and arrange lemon slices in 1 layer alongside zucchini. Switch position of pans and roast until zucchini and lemon slices are tender and browned, about 7 minutes. Serve, overlapping slices slightly, on a platter (not in a bowl) to prevent weeping.

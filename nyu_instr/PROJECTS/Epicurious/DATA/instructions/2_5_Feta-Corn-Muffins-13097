Preheat oven to 425°F. and butter well twelve 1/3-cup muffin tins.
In a large bowl whisk together cornmeal, flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Add sage and feta and toss well.
In a small bowl whisk together milk, egg, and butter.
Add egg mixture to dry ingredients, stirring until batter is just combined (do not overmix).
Divide batter among prepared muffin tins. Bake muffins in middle of oven about 18 to 20 minutes, or until golden and springy to touch.
Turn muffins out onto racks to cool.

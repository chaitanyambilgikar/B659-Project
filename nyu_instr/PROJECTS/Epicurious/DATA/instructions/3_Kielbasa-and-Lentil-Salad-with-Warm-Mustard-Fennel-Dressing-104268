Pour off any fat from skillet and discard. Add remaining 1/2 cup oil to skillet; heat over medium heat. Add garlic and stir until golden, about 2 minutes. Discard garlic. Add fennel bulb to skillet and sauté until crisp-tender, about 4 minutes. Add green onions and stir 1 minute. Whisk in vinegar mixture and bring to boil. Pour fennel mixture over lentils. Toss to coat. Season with salt and pepper.

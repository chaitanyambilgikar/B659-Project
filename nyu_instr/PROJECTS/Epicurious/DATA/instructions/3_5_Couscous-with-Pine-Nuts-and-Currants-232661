Heat oven to 400°F. Spread sesame seeds and pine nuts on a cookie sheet and bake until golden, about 5 minutes. Remove from sheet and set aside. In a large saucepan, boil 1 cup water with butter and salt. Remove from heat and add couscous. Stir, cover and let stand 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork. Toss couscous with sesame seeds, pine nuts, chickpeas, cucumber, currants, and fines herbes. Season to taste with remaining ingredients and salt and pepper.

In a medium sauté pan or frying pan, heat the 1 tbsp olive oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add the prosciutto and sauté until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add the shallots and sauté until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the carrots and bell pepper/capsicum and sauté for 5 minutes, or until crisp-tender. Set aside.
In a medium saucepan, combine the lentils with at least 4 cups/960 ml salted water. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer, cover, and cook until the lentils are just tender, about 30 minutes. Drain, then transfer to a large bowl. Add the prosciutto mixture, along with the parsley and thyme; toss to combine.
In a small bowl, whisk together the vinegar and mustard. Gradually whisk in the 1/3 cup/75 ml olive oil until emulsified. Add the salt and pepper. Toss the lentil salad with the dressing. Taste and adjust the seasoning.

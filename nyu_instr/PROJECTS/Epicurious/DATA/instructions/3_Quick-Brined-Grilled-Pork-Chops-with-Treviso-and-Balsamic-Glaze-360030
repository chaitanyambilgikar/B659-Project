Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Mix 1 1/2 cups water, coarse salt, and sugar in 11 x 7 x 2-inch glass baking dish; stir until salt and sugar dissolve. Add pork chops; let brine 20 minutes, turning occasionally.
Cut Treviso and endive lengthwise into quarters, keeping some core attached to each piece. Place on baking sheet; brush with some oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Boil vinegar in small skillet until reduced to 1/4 cup, about 5 minutes. Whisk in butter. Season glaze with salt and pepper.
Remove pork from brine; pat dry. Brush with oil; sprinkle with pepper. Grill pork, Treviso, and endive until vegetables are softened and thermometer inserted horizontally into center of chops registers 150°F, 2 to 3 minutes per side for vegetables and 7 to 8 minutes per side for chops.
Transfer pork and vegetables to plates. Drizzle glaze over; sprinkle with parsley.

Whisk together flour and beer in a bowl until smooth.
Heat 2 inches oil in a 4-quart heavy pot over moderate heat until it registers 365°F on thermometer.
Working in batches of about 15, toss sugar snaps in batter until coated. Lift sugar snaps out of batter 1 at a time, letting excess batter drip off, and transfer to oil. Fry sugar snaps, turning with a slotted spoon, until golden, about 1 1/2 minutes. Transfer with slotted spoon to paper towels to drain. (Return oil to 365°F between batches.)
Serve sugar snaps warm.

Make sauce: Stir together all sauce ingredients and chill, covered, at least 1 hour to allow flavors to develop. Bring to room temperature before serving.
Make fries: Heat 2 inches of oil slowly in a 5- to 6-quart heavy pot over moderately low heat until thermometer registers 300°F.
While oil is heating, peel potatoes, then cut lengthwise into 1/3-inch-thick sticks and submerge in a large bowl of ice and cold water. Rinse potatoes in several changes of cold water in bowl (more ice isn't necessary) until water is clear. Drain in a colander and spread potatoes out in 1 layer on several layers of paper towels to drain, then pat dry.
When oil is ready, increase heat to moderately high and fry potatoes in 4 batches, turning, until just cooked through but still white, about 3 minutes. (Return oil to 300°F between batches.) Transfer as fried with a slotted spoon to dry paper towels to drain. Cool potatoes to room temperature, about 30 minutes.
Reheat oil over moderately high heat until thermometer registers 375°F. Fry potatoes again in 4 batches, turning, until deep golden, 3 to 4 minutes. (Return oil to 375°F between batches.) Transfer as fried with a slotted spoon to dry paper towels to drain briefly, then season with salt and serve immediately, with sauce for dipping.

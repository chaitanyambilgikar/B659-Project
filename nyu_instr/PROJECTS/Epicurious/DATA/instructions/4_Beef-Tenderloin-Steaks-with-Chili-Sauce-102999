Place both chilies and plum tomato in heavy medium skillet. Toast over medium-high heat until chilies are fragrant and deepen in color and tomato turns black in spots, turning occasionally, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Cool. Stem, seed and tear chilies into small pieces. Chop tomato. Place chilies, tomato and 1 cup water in small saucepan. Bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer until chilies are tender, about 10 minutes. Puree chili mixture in blender until smooth.
Heat 3 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add garlic and sauté 1 minute. Add 1 cup chicken stock and beef stock, then wine; boil until reduced to 1 cup, about 15 minutes. Stir in chili puree, butter and rosemary; simmer 1 minute. Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper. (Sauce can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle steaks with salt and pepper. Add steaks to skillet and cook to desired doneness, about 4 minutes per side for medium-rare.
Bring sauce to simmer, thinning with more chicken stock if necessary. Place 1 steak on each of 4 plates. Top each with 1/4 cup sauce. Serve, passing remaining sauce separately.

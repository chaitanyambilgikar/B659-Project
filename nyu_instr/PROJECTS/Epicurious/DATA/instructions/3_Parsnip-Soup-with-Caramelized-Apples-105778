Melt 2 tablespoons butter in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add apples and cook until golden brown, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Transfer 2/3 of apples to small bowl; set aside for garnish. Add remaining 2 tablespoons butter to apples in pot. Add onions and carrot; sauté until onions begin to soften, about 3 minutes. Add parsnips, broth, and water. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes. Cool slightly. Puree soup in 3 batches in blender until smooth. Return soup to pot. Stir in half and half and lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover soup and apples separately and refrigerate. Bring soup to simmer before using.)
Rewarm reserved apples in small skillet over medium heat. Divide soup among 10 to 12 bowls. Top with apples.

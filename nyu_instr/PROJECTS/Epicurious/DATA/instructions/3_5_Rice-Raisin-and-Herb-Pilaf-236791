Heat oil in large saucepan over medium heat. Add onions and sauté 10 minutes. Mix in rice, then broth, raisins, lemon juice, and allspice. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium–low, cover, and cook until rice is tender and broth is absorbed, about 20 minutes. Mix in pine nuts, mint, and dill. Season with salt and pepper.

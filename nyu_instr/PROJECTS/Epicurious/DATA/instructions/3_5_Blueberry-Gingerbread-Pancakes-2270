Preheat oven to 200°F. Sift first 6 ingredients into medium bowl twice. Whisk molasses, buttermilk, eggs and 3 tablespoons oil in large bowl to blend. Add dry ingredients and whisk mixture just until smooth. Fold into blueberries.
Heat large nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Brush skillet generously with additional oil. Working in batches, drop 3 tablespoons batter for each pancake into skillet. Using back of spoon, spread each pancake to 3-inch round. Cook until bottoms are light golden brown, about 1 1/2 minutes. Turn pancakes over and cook until just cooked through, about 1 1/2 minutes. Transfer pancakes to baking sheet; keep warm in oven up to 20 minutes. Brush skillet with additional oil for each batch.

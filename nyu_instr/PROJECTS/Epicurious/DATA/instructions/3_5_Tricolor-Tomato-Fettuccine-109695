Heat 1/3 cup oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Add shallots and sauté 5 minutes. Add garlic; sauté 2 minutes. Reduce heat to medium; add tomatoes and herbs. Stir until tomatoes are heated through, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat; season with salt and pepper.
Meanwhile, cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite. Drain; transfer to bowl. Top with tomato mixture. Drizzle with 1/3 cup oil and sprinkle with Parmesan.

Pat chicken dry and sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt.
Heat oil in a 6- to 8-quart heavy pot over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then brown chicken in batches (without crowding), turning over occasionally, 8 to 10 minutes per batch. Transfer to a plate as cooked, reserving fat in pot.
Add onion, ginger, garlic, cinnamon sticks, and bay leaf to fat in pot and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is browned, about 5 minutes. Add curry powder and flour and cook over moderately high heat, stirring, 1 minute. Stir in sugar (if using), coconut milk, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and bring to a boil, stirring and scraping up any brown bits from bottom of pot. Return chicken and any juices accumulated on plate to pot, then reduce heat and simmer, covered, stirring occasionally, until chicken is cooked through, about 20 minutes. Discard cinnamon sticks and bay leaf. Season with salt, then transfer to a shallow serving dish.
Serve chicken over rice and topped with remaining accompaniments.

In electric mixer, beat butter and sugar at medium-high speed until fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add vanilla, baking soda, and salt and beat at medium speed until incorporated. Beat in egg. Add flour and mix at low speed until just combined. Divide dough in half, form into 2 disks, and wrap in plastic wrap or waxed paper. Chill until firm, at least 1 hour or up to 2 days.
Arrange racks in upper and lower thirds of oven and preheat to 375°F. Line 2 heavy large baking sheets with parchment paper.
Remove 1 dough disk from refrigerator. On lightly floured work surface, roll out dough to 1/4-inch thickness. Using 5- to 6-inch snowman cookie cutter, cut out cookies; transfer with spatula to baking sheets. Gather and reroll scraps and cut out additional cookies. Chill cookies 10 minutes.
Bake until golden and somewhat firm to touch, about 15 minutes. Cool on pans 5 minutes, then transfer to racks and cool completely. Repeat with remaining dough.
To decorate cookies: Transfer royal icing to pastry bag fitted with #3 or #4 plain round tip. (Alternatively, place icing in sturdy plastic bag and snip off tiny hole from one corner.) Pipe outline around edge of cookie, then make dots for eyes, nose, and mouth and place mini M&M on each. Pipe 3 lines across hat area, cut black licorice to fit, and place to make hat. Pipe 3 dots for buttons and place cinnamon candy on each. Pipe horizontally across neck and cut and fit red licorice in place for scarf.
Let icing dry completely (about 1 hour, depending on humidity). Wrap cookies individually in cellophane bags tied with ribbon.

1. Season the lamb and allow it to come to room temperature. Preheat the oven to 450°F (230°C).
2. Spread the lamb trimmings or stew meat over the bottom of a roasting pan just large enough to hold the rack and roast until lightly browned, about 30 minutes.
3. Place the rack on top of the trimmings (this base of trimmings is called a fonçage) and slide into the oven. Roast until springy to the touch, about 25 minutes. Let rest, loosely covered with aluminum foil, for 15 minutes.
4. Put the roasting pan on top of the stove and pour over a cup (250 milliliters) of broth. Bring to a boil and boil until a brown crust of caramelized juices forms on the roasting pan. Pour out any liquid fat floating on top. Deglaze again with a cup (250 milliliters) of broth and scrape up the juices. Repeat the caramelization as many times as practical before deglazing a final time. Pass the jus in a sauce boat at the table.

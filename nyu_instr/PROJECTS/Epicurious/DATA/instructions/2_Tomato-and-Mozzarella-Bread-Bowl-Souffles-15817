Preheat oven to 375°F.
In a small bowl cover dried tomatoes with boiling water by 1 inch. Soak dried tomatoes 30 minutes. Drain tomatoes in a sieve and pat very dry.
Quarter and seed plum tomatoes. Cut tomatoes into 1/4-inch dice and drain on paper towels. Pat tomatoes dry. Cut mozzarella into 1/4-inch dice.
Cut off and discard top thirds of rolls. Hollow out centers of rolls, leaving a 1/3-inch-thick shell. Melt 2 tablespoons butter and brush insides of shells. Season shells with salt and pepper and arrange on a baking sheet.
In a saucepan melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter over moderately low heat and whisk in flour. Cook roux, stirring, 3 minutes and whisk in milk and cream. Bring mixture to a boil, whisking constantly, and simmer, whisking occasionally, 3 minutes. In a food processor purée together milk mixture, dried tomatoes, parsley, and salt and pepper to taste until smooth.
Separate eggs. Transfer purée to a large bowl and stir in yolks, plum tomatoes, and mozzarella. Cool mixture completely. Bread shells, egg whites, and tomato mixture may be chilled, covered, up to 6 hours.
In a large bowl with an electric mixer beat whites with a pinch salt until they just hold stiff peaks. Stir one fourth whites into tomato mixture to lighten and fold in remaining whites gently but thoroughly.
Divide soufflé mixture among shells and run tip of a knife around edges of soufflés to aid rising. Bake soufflés in lower third of oven until puffed and golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes.

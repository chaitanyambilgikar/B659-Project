Cut melon in half and scoop seeds and enough juicy flesh from center to measure 3/4 cup.
Purée in a blender with sugar and lemon juice until seeds are almost completely ground and mixture is creamy, about 2 minutes.
Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, pressing on and then discarding solids.
Meanwhile, cut melon into 6 wedges and remove skin. Cut each wedge into thin slices and serve drizzled with coulis.

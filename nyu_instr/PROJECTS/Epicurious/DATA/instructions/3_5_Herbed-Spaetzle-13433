In a 6-quart kettle bring 5 quarts salted water to a boil for Spaetzle. In a large bowl whisk together flour and salt. Put parsley in a blender. In a heavy saucepan bring milk just to a simmer. With blender motor running add milk to parsley and blend until milk is very green.
In a bowl whisk together eggs and water and add green milk in a slow stream, whisking constantly.
Add milk mixture to flour mixture, whisking until mixture forms a soft, smooth batterlike dough. Force dough through a Spaetzle-maker (see above) into kettle of boiling water.
Preheat oven to 375° F.
Stir Spaetzle gently to separate and boil 5 minutes, or until just tender. In a large colander drain Spaetzle and rinse well under cold water. Drain Spaetzle well and transfer to a large baking dish.
In a small heavy saucepan cook rosemary with salt and pepper to taste in butter over moderate heat, stirring, 2 minutes and drizzle over Spaetzle, tossing well. Season Spaetzle with salt and pepper. Spaetzle may be prepared up to this point 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.
Bake Spaetzle, covered with foil, in oven 20 minutes, or until heated through.

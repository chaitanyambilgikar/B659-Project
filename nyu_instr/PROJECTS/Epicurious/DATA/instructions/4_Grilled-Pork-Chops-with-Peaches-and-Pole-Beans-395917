Combine 1/2 cup olive oil and vegetable oil in a measuring cup. Combine 2 tablespoons marjoram, Dijon mustard, garlic, and vinegar in a medium bowl. Slowly whisk oil mixture into herb mixture until creamy. Season to taste with pepper. Transfer about 1/4 cup dressing to a small bowl; cover and chill.
Season pork chops with 4 teaspoons salt. Transfer to a resealable plastic bag; pour remaining dressing over, spreading evenly to distribute. Seal bag; chill for at least 4 hours and up to 24 hours.
Cook beans in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until crisp-tender, 3-5 minutes. Drain; transfer to a large bowl of ice water to chill. Drain beans; pat dry. Transfer beans, remaining 1 tablespoon marjoram, and shallot to a medium bowl; toss with enough reserved dressing to coat and season with salt and pepper.
Build a medium fire in a charcoal grill, or heat a gas grill to medium-high. Remove pork chops from bag, scraping off excess dressing. Grill chops, turning occasionally on all sides, until browned and cooked through, about 20 minutes total. (Be sure to cook thick chops on the edges, too, and melt the thin strips of white fat; they'll cook more evenly.)
Place peaches in a medium bowl; drizzle with some olive oil and sprinkle with salt. Toss to coat. Grill peaches, cut side down, until they begin to soften and char, 4-6 minutes. Transfer pork and peaches to a cutting board; let pork rest for 10 minutes.
Slice peaches. Carve bones from pork and thinly slice meat. Serve pork and peaches with bean salad.

Marinate scallops: Finely grind coriander seeds, peppercorns, and cloves in an electric coffee/spice grinder or with a mortar and pestle, then stir together with sugar, kosher salt, cilantro, and zest in a bowl. Cut tough muscles from scallops and toss scallops in salt mixture. Bury scallops in salt mixture and chill, covered, 30 minutes. Rinse scallops lightly and dry well with paper towels.
Smoke scallops: Line drip tray of smoker with foil and spread wood chips evenly over center of smoker pan. Put drip tray on top of chips and put a lightly oiled rack in tray. Season scallops lightly with salt and pepper and put on rack. Put smoker on stove, centered on 1 burner, and heat, uncovered, over moderate heat until chips begin to smolder, 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce heat to low, slide cover on, and smoke scallops 15 minutes. Remove smoker from heat (scallops will be partially cooked).
Make balsamic glaze: Boil vinegar in a very small heavy saucepan over moderate heat until reduced by about half, about 3 minutes. Keep warm, covered.
Sauté scallops: Heat oil in a 10-inch nonstick skillet over moderately high heat until just smoking, then sear scallops until browned on both sides, about 4 minutes total.
Serve scallops on sautéed spinach, drizzled with balsamic glaze.

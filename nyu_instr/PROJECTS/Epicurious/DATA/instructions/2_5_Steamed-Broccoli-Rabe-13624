In a large steamer set over boiling water steam broccoli rabe, covered, until tender, about 5 minutes, and transfer to a platter. In a small skillet heat oil with red pepper flakes over moderate heat until hot but not smoking and drizzle over broccoli rabe. Gently toss broccoli rabe and season with salt. Serve broccoli rabe warm or at room temperature.

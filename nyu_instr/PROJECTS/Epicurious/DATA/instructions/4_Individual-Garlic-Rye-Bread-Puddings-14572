Cut bread into 1/2-inch cubes (5 cups). In a large baking pan dry bread, uncovered, at room temperature 12 hours. (Alternatively, dry bread in a 250°F oven 1 hour.)
Lightly butter 12 non-stick 1/2-cup muffin cups.
Mince garlic and mash to a paste with salt. In a small saucepan melt butter over moderate heat and stir in garlic paste. In a bowl toss together bread and garlic butter and divide evenly among muffin cups. In a bowl whisk together whole eggs, yolks, milk, cream, and pepper and ladle slowly and evenly over bread mixture. Chill puddings, covered, at least 1 hour and up to 8.
Preheat oven to 350°F.
Bake puddings in middle of oven until golden and puffed, about 40 minutes, and cool in cups on a rack 10 minutes (puddings will sink as they cool). Run a thin knife around side of each cup and lift puddings out with a fork. Serve puddings warm.

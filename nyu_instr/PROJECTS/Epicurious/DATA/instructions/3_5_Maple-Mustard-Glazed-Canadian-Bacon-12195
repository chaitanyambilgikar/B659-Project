Preheat broiler.
In a small bowl stir together mustard, syrup, and cayenne. Arrange bacon slices in one layer on rack of a broiler pan or in a jelly-roll pan and brush 1 side of each bacon slice generously with glaze. Broil bacon about 4 inches from heat 3 minutes. Turn bacon and broil just until golden around edges, 3 to 4 minutes.

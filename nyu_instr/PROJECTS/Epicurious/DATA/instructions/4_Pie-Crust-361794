Blend flour, sugar, and salt in processor. Add butter and shortening; using on/off turns, process until mixture resembles coarse meal. Transfer mixture to large bowl. Add 5 tablespoons ice water; mix with fork until moist crumbs form, adding more ice water by teaspoonfuls if dry. Gather dough together; divide into 2 equal pieces. Form each piece into ball; flatten into disks and wrap in plastic. Chill at least 30 minutes. DO AHEAD: Can be made 3 days ahead. Keep chilled. Let soften slightly before rolling.

Prepare this dish right before serving. Start by cutting up the fruit into bite-sized pieces (this can be done in advance), then soaking the bread cubes in the lemon extract. Anything soaked in lemon extract will burn with a lovely blue/yellow flame — that includes your clothing, the Formica, and this book, so be careful. Stack the fruit on the skewers, interspersing a cube whereever you'd like a flame. Be sure not to put a bread cube too close to the handle of the skewer. When the kebabs are all stacked, light the bread cubes. They'll burn nicely for a few minutes, but be sure to blow them out before trying to eat the fruit. Also, it's probably not a good idea to serve this dish in bed.

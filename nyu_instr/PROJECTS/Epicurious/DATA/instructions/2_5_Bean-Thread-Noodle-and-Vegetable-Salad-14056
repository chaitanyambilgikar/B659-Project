Make dressing: In a small saucepan stir together all dressing ingredients except sesame oil until cornstarch is dissolved. Bring dressing to a boil, stirring, and simmer, stirring constantly, 1 minute. Cool dressing completely and stir in sesame oil. Dressing may be made 2 days ahead and chilled, covered.
Discard mushroom stems and cut caps into thin slices. In a large non-stick skillet heat vegetable oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and sauté mushrooms, stirring frequently, until just tender, about 5 minutes. On a platter chill mushrooms in one layer 15 minutes, or until cool.
In a saucepan bring 6 cups water to a boil and remove pan from heat. Stir in noodles and soak 15 minutes. Drain noodles well in a colander and with scissors cut into 6-inch lengths.
While noodles are soaking, cut cabbage crosswise into fine shreds and snow peas diagonally into slivers. Cut bell pepper into julienne strips.
In a large bowl toss together noodles, mushrooms, bell peppers, carrots, scallions, and dressing. Serve salad sprinkled with sesame seeds.

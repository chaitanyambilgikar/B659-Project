Flush the oil from the can of tuna by holding it under cold running water, then drain and flake. Combine fish and the next nine ingredients, mixing lightly with a fork. Serve in a nest of shredded greens - lettuce, watercress, spinach, escarole. Garnish with radishes, sweet gherkins, and rolled watercress sandwiches.

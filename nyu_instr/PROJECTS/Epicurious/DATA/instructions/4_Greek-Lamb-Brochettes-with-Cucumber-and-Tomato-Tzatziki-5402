Cut trimmed lamb into 1 1/4- to 1 1/2-inch cubes. Mix lamb and next 6 ingredients in glass baking dish. Cover mixture and refrigerate at least 4 hours and up to 8 hours, turning lamb occasionally.
Preheat broiler or prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Divide lamb cubes among skewers. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Arrange skewers on broiler pan or grill. Drizzle with any remaining marinade. Broil or grill lamb to desired doneness, turning occasionally, about 9 minutes for medium-rare. Serve hot with tzatziki.

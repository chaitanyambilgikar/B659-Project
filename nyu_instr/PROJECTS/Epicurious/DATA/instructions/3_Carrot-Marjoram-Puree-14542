Peel carrots and cut into 1/2-inch pieces. Fill a 7- to 8-quart kettle three fourths full with salted water and bring to a boil. Add carrots and rice and cook, stirring until water returns to a boil, until carrots are very tender, about 30 minutes. Drain mixture well in a large sieve. In a food processor puree half of carrot mixture with half of butter until smooth and transfer to a bowl. Puree remaining carrot mixture and butter in same manner and transfer to bowl. Season puree with salt and pepper and stir in marjoram. (Puree may be made 2 days ahead and cooled completely before being chilled, covered.)
Serve puree garnished with marjoram.

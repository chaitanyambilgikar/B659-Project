Place veal chops in baking dish. Brush with oil, then sprinkle both sides with peppercorns and rosemary. Let stand at room temperature 1 hour. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
Preheat broiler. Transfer veal chops to broiler pan. Sprinkle with salt. Broil veal 6 inches from heat source to desired doneness, about 5 minutes per side for medium-rare. Transfer veal to plates. Pour any accumulated broiler pan drippings over veal and serve.

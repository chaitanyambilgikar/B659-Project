Make crust: Mix flour and salt in processor. Add shortening and butter. Using on/off turns, process until mixture resembles coarse meal. Mix in water 1 tablespoon at a time just until moist clumps form. Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 425°F. Roll out dough between 2 layers of plastic wrap to 12-inch round. Remove top layer of plastic. Invert dough onto unrimmed baking sheet. Remove top layer of plastic.
Make filling: Combine figs and 3 tablespoons sugar in large bowl; toss to coat. Toss raspberries with 1/2 tablespoon sugar in medium bowl. Arrange figs in concentric rows over dough on baking sheet, leaving 2-inch border around edges. Sprinkle raspberries over figs. Fold dough border over fruit, pleating loosely and pinching to seal any cracks. Brush dough border with egg mixture. Sprinkle border with 1/2 tablespoon sugar.
Bake galette until crust is brown and filling bubbles, about 35 minutes. Transfer baking sheet to rack and cool galette slightly, about 20 minutes. Slide spatula under all sides of crust to free galette from baking sheet. Using large tart pan bottom as aid, transfer galette to platter. Serve warm or at room temperature.

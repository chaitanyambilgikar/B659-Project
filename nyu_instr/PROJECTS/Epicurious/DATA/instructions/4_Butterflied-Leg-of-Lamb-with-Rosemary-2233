Place lamb in large glass baking dish with 2-inch high sides. Pour marinade over lamb, making certain all parts of lamb are covered with marinade. Cover; chill at least 8 hours or overnight. Let stand 2 hours at room temperature before cooking.

Grill lamb until brown and crusty on outside and thermometer inserted into thickest part registers 130°F for medium-rare, turning occasionally, about 20 minutes. Transfer to platter and tent with foil. Let stand 10 minutes. Cut on diagonal into thin slices.

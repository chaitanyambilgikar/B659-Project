Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter 13x9x2-inch glass baking dish. Whisk 1 cup sugar and next 3 ingredients in large bowl to blend. Mix in rhubarb and cranberries, then concentrate. Transfer to prepared dish. Bake until heated through and bubbling, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, beat butter and remaining 1 cup sugar in medium bowl until blended. Beat in egg and vanilla, then milk. Sift flour, baking powder and salt over; beat batter to blend. Drop batter by scant tablespoonfuls over hot fruit mixture. Bake cobbler until topping is golden and filling is bubbling thickly, about 45 minutes. Transfer cobbler to bowls or goblets and top with ice cream.

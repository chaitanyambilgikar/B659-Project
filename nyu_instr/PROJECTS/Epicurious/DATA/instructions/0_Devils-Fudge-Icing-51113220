1. In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the butter and cocoa powder and beat on low speed, scraping down the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed, until blended and very smooth, about 2 minutes. Add the corn syrup, vanilla, and salt and continue to beat until evenly blended, 1 to 2 minutes.
2. Add 1/2 cup hot water in 3 additions, beating until completely incorporated and evenly blended between each addition.
3. Add the confectioners' sugar and beat on low speed until blended. Increase the speed to medium and beat until very smooth and light, 2 to 3 minutes. Use the icing immediately, or cover and refrigerate up to 1 week.

Put pork in a heavy 4-quart pot and sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and pepper to taste. Cover pot and let meat steam over high heat, stirring once, 10 minutes. Remove lid and cook, stirring occasionally, until juices are evaporated, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in 1 tablespoon oil and sauté, stirring occasionally, until meat is browned, 6 to 8 minutes.
While pork is steaming, mash garlic, savory, and remaining 3/4 teaspoon salt to a paste with a mortar and pestle (see cooks’ notes, below). Scrape paste into a small bowl, then coarsely grind coriander and fenugreek seeds in mortar.
Add garlic paste to pork with remaining tablespoon oil and cook over moderate heat, stirring, 1 minute. Add onion, fenugreek mixture, and marigold and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is softened, about 5 minutes.
Add water and bring to a boil. Cook, covered, at a bare simmer until meat is tender, about 1 hour.
Stir in cilantro, 3 tablespoons ajika, and pepper to taste. Serve more ajika on the side.

Combine the turkey with the pitted olives. Arrange on a bed of greens and garnish with the capers, tomato sections, and egg.
Spoon mayonnaise over the salad and sprinkling of finely chopped parsley.
For an excellent luncheon serve this salad with crisp hot buttered toast and drink a Pouilly Fumé. Follow it with a chocolate mousse or cassis sherbet.

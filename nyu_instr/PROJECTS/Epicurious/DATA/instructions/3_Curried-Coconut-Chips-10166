Preheat oven to 400°F.
Pierce the softest eye of coconut with an ice pick or skewer and drain liquid. Bake coconut in oven 15 minutes and on a work surface break open with a hammer. With point of a small knife carefully pry flesh out of shell and cut into large pieces. With a vegetable peeler shave coconut along cut edges into thin strips.
Reduce oven temperature to 350°F.
In a bowl stir together remaining ingredients and add coconut strips. Toss mixture well and spread in one layer in 2 large shallow baking pans. Bake chips in upper and lower third of oven, switching position of pans halfway through baking and stirring occasionally, until crisp and beginning to turn golden, 15 to 20 minutes. Chips keep in an airtight container at room temperature 4 days.

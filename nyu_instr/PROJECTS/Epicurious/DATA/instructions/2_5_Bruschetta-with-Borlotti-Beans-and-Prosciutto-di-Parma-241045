1. Put the beans in a bowl or pot and add enough cold water to cover. Set aside to soak at room temperature for at least 8 hours. Change the water once or twice, if possible.
2. Drain the beans, transfer to a heavy-bottomed pot, and add water to cover by an inch or two. Bring the water to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low, skim off any foam that rises to the surface, and simmer for about 1 hour, or until the beans are nearly tender. Check the water level during cooking and replenish it, if necessary. It's important to keep the beans submerged at all times during cooking.
3. Drain the beans and cool at room temperature. Cover and refrigerate until needed. The cooked beans will keep for up to 2 days.
4. In a large pot, cook the bacon over medium-high heat for about 6 minutes, or until brown and the fat is rendered. Add the onion, celery, fennel, salt, cayenne, and black pepper and cook, stirring, for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the onion softens. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for about 30 seconds, then add the wine. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to a brisk simmer, and cook until reduced by half.
5. Add the tomatoes and their juices. Cook for about 2 minutes, then add the stock, vinegar, bay leaf, and beans.
6. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low, season to taste with salt and pepper, cover, and simmer for 10 to 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until tender. Add more stock if necessary to keep the beans well moistened. Stir in the butter until incorporated.
7. Remove the beans from the heat and let them cool in the liquid until warm or room temperature.
8. In a small bowl, mix together the basil and sage.
9. Using a slotted spoon, scoop some beans from the pot and put on top of each toast. Too much liquid will make the bruschetta soggy, so drain carefully when lifting the beans from the pot.
10. Garnish each bruschetta with 1 slice of prosciutto and a sprinkling of the herbs. Drizzle with olive oil and serve.

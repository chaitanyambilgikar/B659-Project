Make syrup: Combine all syrup ingredients in a 1-quart heavy saucepan and bring to a boil, covered, stirring occasionally until sugar is dissolved. Remove lid and boil until slightly thickened and reduced to about 1 cup, about 15 minutes. Cool syrup, then discard cinnamon sticks and zest.
Make pastries: Whisk together flour, salt, and baking powder in a bowl. Add hot water, stirring until a soft dough forms. Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth, 3 to 5 minutes, adding more flour as needed to keep dough from sticking. Form dough into a ball and let stand, covered with plastic wrap, 30 minutes.
Cut dough into 12 equal pieces and roll each into a small ball. Roll out each small ball into a roughly 6 1/2- to 7-inch round (about 1/16 inch thick) with a floured rolling pin, lightly dusting dough and pin with flour as necessary to prevent sticking. Arrange rounds in 1 layer on 2 long sheets of wax paper very lightly dusted with flour.
Heat 1 1/2 inches oil in a wide 4-quart heavy pot over moderate heat until it registers 390 to 400°F on thermometer. Brush excess flour from 1 dough round and fry, turning over once, until golden brown, crisp, and puffed in places, about 2 minutes total. Transfer with tongs to paper towels to drain. Fry remaining rounds, 1 at a time, in same manner, returning oil to 390 to 400°F before adding each.
Serve fried pastries drizzled with syrup.

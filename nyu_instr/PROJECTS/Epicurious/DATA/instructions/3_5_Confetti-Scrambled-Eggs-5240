Melt butter in large nonstick skillet over low heat. Add onions and sauté until very tender, about 8 minutes. Add pepperoni, bell peppers and marjoram. Cook over low heat until bell peppers are crisp-tender, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. Pour in eggs. Stir over medium-low heat until eggs are just set, about 5 minutes. Transfer to bowl and serve.

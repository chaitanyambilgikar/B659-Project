Preheat oven to 350°F. Heat oil in heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add spinach and cook until tender, about 4 minutes. Cool. Combine spinach, ricotta, Parmesan, egg and parsley in large bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Spread 1 cup spaghetti sauce over bottom of 8-inch square baking dish. Pat 1 lasagne noodle dry with paper towel. Set on waxed paper sheet. Spread about 1/3 cup ricotta mixture over noodle. Carefully roll up noodle, starting at 1 short end, to enclose filling. Arrange seam side down in prepared dish. Repeat with remaining noodles. Top with remaining 1 cup sauce. Sprinkle with mozzarella. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover tightly and refrigerate. Bring to room temperature before continuing.) Bake until cheese melts, about 45 minutes.

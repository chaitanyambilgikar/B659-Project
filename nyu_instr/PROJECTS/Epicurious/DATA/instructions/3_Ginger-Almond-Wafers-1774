Preheat oven to 325°F. Line 2 heavy large baking sheets with parchment paper. Combine first 7 ingredients in processor and blend using on/off turns until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add almonds, cream and crystallized ginger and process just until moist clumps form. Shape dough into 1 1/4-inch-diameter balls. Place on prepared sheets. Moisten bottom of glass; dip into powder sugar and press each dough ball to 1/4-inch thickness.
Bake cookies until brown on bottom and edges, about 28 minutes. Transfer cookies to rack and cool. (Store airtight at room temperature.)

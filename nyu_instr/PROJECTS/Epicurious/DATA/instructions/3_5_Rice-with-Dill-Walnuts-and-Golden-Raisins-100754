In a saucepan with a tight-fitting lid bring water to a boil with salt. Stir in rice and cook, covered, over low heat 20 minutes, or until water is absorbed and rice is tender.
While rice is cooking, lightly toast walnuts and chop coarse. Chop dill.
Fluff rice with a fork and stir in walnuts, dill, raisins, zest, vinegar, oil, and salt and pepper to taste.

Make rice: Wash rice in 3 or 4 changes of cold water in a large bowl until water is clear, then drain well in a large sieve. Bring 1 3/4 cups water and 1/4 teaspoon salt to a boil, then add rice and cook, covered tightly, over low heat until water is absorbed and rice is tender, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand, covered and undisturbed, 10 minutes. Fluff rice with a fork and transfer to a bowl to cool to warm.
Make dressing and serve wraps: Purée all dressing ingredients in a blender until smooth, about 1 minute.
Toss shredded chicken with lime vinaigrette.
Put chicken and remaining wrap ingredients in bowls on a large platter with ginger dressing on the side.

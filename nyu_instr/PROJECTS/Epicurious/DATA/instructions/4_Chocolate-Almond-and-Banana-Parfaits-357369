Heat chocolate chips and 4 tablespoons cream in microwave in 1-cup glass measuring cup at 50 percent power just until chocolate is melted, about 30 to 35 seconds. Stir to blend; cool chocolate sauce to lukewarm. Whisk mascarpone, amaretto, sugar, and remaining 2 tablespoons cream in medium bowl until blended and mixture just starts to thicken.
Using 2 1/2-inch-diameter cookie cutter, cut out round from each angel food cake slice. Place 1 cake round in each of 4 wine goblets or old-fashioned glasses. Top each cake round with 3 banana slices, 1 heaping tablespoon mascarpone mixture, bittersweet chocolate sauce, and sprinkling of almonds. Repeat parfait layering 1 more time and serve.

For Crust: Preheat oven to 350°F. Line 9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom with foil, carefully pressing up sides and into grooves. Brush foil with vegetable oil. Finely grind first 4 ingredients in processor. Add egg white and vanilla and blend until mixture almost forms balls. Press onto bottom (not up sides) of prepared pan, using wet finger-tips as aid. Bake until crust looks dry and feels firm, about 14 minutes. Cool.

Pour 1/2 cup of mixture into small bowl; add butter to mixture in small bowl and whisk until smooth. Set aside for garnish.
Drop dark chocolate filling and remaining white chocolate filling alternately by 1/4 cupfuls onto crust. Swirl fillings together using tip of knife. Freeze until firm, about 1 hour.

Turn tart on side and carefully peel foil off bottom of tart. Place tart on platter. Spoon reserved white chocolate filling into pastry bag fitted with medium star tip.

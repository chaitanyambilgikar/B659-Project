Toast cumin in a dry small heavy skillet over medium heat, stirring constantly, until fragrant and a shade darker, about 1 minute. Transfer to a large bowl.
Add pumpkin seeds to skillet and heat, stirring constantly, until slightly puffed (be careful not to brown them), 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer seeds to a small bowl and stir in 1/4 teaspoon oil and salt to taste.
Whisk together cumin, vinegar, chile, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/8 teaspoon pepper, and remaining 2 tablespoons oil in large bowl, then gently toss with tomatoes, melon, and cilantro. Sprinkle with pumpkin seeds.

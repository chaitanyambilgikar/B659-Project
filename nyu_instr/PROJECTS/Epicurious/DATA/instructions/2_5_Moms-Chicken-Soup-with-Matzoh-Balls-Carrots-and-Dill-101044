In a bowl, mix together matzoh meal, chicken fat and seltzer. Whisk eggs in a separate bowl until frothy. Stir into matzoh meal mix with 1 teaspoon salt. Refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours.
Bring 2 quarts of chicken soup to a simmer. Take a small spoonful of the mixture and using two small spoons, shape the mixture into small balls (about the size of a large marble) and place in simmering soup. Cook for 35 minutes.
Meanwhile, if you're making orzo, toast it in a dry, medium skillet over medium low heat, stirring often until it turns a light golden brown. Boil the orzo until al dente, drain and reserve for soup.
Bring remaining 2 quarts of chicken stock to a boil. Cook carrots until al dente. Lower to a simmer, add cooked matzoh balls, orzo (if using), and dill. Serve very hot.

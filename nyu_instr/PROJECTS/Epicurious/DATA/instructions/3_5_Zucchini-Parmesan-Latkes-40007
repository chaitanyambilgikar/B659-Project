1. Grate the zucchini and potatoes and toss in the lemon juice to prevent browning. Squeeze the zucchini and potatoes through towels or a sieve. It is imperative that you get almost all the moisture out of the vegetables.
2. Add the scallions, cheese, garlic, 1/2 cup of the parsley, salt and pepper, sugar, flour, and eggs and toss to make sure that the ingredients are well mixed.
3. Heat a 1/2 inch of peanut oil in a pan until hot and add thin silver dollar-size pancakes, frying over high heat until golden brown and crispy. When serving, sprinkle with a little more salt and the remaining chopped parsley.

Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally. Drain, reserving 1/2 cup pasta cooking liquid. Return pasta to pot. Add olive bruschetta spread, 3 tablespoons oil, 2 teaspoons lemon peel, lemon juice, and enough cooking liquid to coat. Season with salt and generous amount of pepper. Mix in arugula, which will wilt slightly.
Meanwhile, brush each tuna steak with 1 tablespoon oil; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Sprinkle both sides of tuna steaks evenly with marjoram and remaining 2 teaspoons lemon peel; press gently to adhere.
Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in large nonstick skillet over high heat. Add tuna; sear until crusty and brown outside but still pink inside, about 1 1/2 minutes per side. Transfer tuna to work surface; slice thinly. Divide pasta among plates; top with tuna slices.

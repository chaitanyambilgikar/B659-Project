Melt butter in heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add turnips and stir to heat through. Add leeks and sauté until leeks are soft, about 5 minutes. Season with pepper. Add wine and bay leaf and boil until liquid is reduced to glaze, about 3 minutes. Add stock and boil until liquid is reduced by half, about 7 minutes. Reduce heat, cover and simmer until turnips are tender and almost no liquid remains in skillet, about 20 minutes. (Can be made 2 hours ahead. Cover and let stand at room temperature.)
Cook potatoes in large pot of boiling water until tender. Drain well. Puree through food mill into same pot. Reheat turnip mixture boiling to reduce liquid to glaze if necessary. Discard bay leaf. Puree turnip mixture through food mill into same pot with potatoes. Mix together gently, adding enough milk to thin to desired consistency. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with parsley and serve.

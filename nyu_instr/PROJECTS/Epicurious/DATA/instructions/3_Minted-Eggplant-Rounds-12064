Preheat broiler
Cut eggplants crosswise into 3/4-inch slices and arrange on baking sheets. Brush both sides lightly with oil and broil in batches about 4 inches from heat until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes on each side.
While eggplant is broiling, stir together lime juice, fish sauce, sugar, garlic, and mint until sugar is dissolved.
Serve eggplant drizzled with sauce.

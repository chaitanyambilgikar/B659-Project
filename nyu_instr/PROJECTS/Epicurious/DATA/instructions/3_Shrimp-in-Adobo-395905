Heat a large dry cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add chiles; toast, turning often, until just fragrant, about 1 minute. Let cool.
Using kitchen scissors and working over a medium bowl, cut chiles into 1" rings, reserving seeds. Cover chiles with 1/2 cup hot water; let soak, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes.
Transfer chiles with seeds and soaking liquid to a blender. Add garlic, vinegar, 2 teaspoons salt, oregano, cumin, and sugar and purée until a smooth, thick paste forms. Transfer adobo paste to a large bowl; add shrimp and toss until evenly coated.
Preheat broiler. Place shrimp on a rimmed baking sheet in an even layer. Broil, watching closely and stirring halfway through, until shrimp are just cooked through and are browned in spots, 4-5 minutes. Season with salt.

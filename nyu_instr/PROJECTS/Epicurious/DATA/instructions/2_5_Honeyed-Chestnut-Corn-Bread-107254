Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter and flour 9-inch round cake pan with 2-inch-high sides. Whisk first 5 ingredients in medium bowl to blend. Using electric mixer, beat butter, honey, and sugar in large bowl until pale. Add yolks 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Mix in chestnuts and thyme. Mix in dry ingredients, alternating with buttermilk, in 3 additions each. Using electric mixer fitted with clean dry beaters, beat whites in another large bowl to medium-stiff peaks. Fold whites into batter.
Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake until top is golden and slightly puffed, about 50 minutes. Cool corn bread in pan on rack 10 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cool completely. Wrap in foil and let stand at room temperature.)

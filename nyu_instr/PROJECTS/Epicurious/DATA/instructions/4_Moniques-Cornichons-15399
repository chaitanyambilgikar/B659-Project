In a large bowl toss the cornichons with the salt. Turn them out into a tea towel, gather the towel by the four corners and hang it from the faucet over the sink, for 2 hours. Alternatively, set the cornichons in their towel in a strainer in the sink.
Place the tarragon in a quart jar, then evenly layer the cornichons with the garlic, onions, and the other herbs, until they reach about 1/2-inch below the top of the jar. Bring the vinegar to a boil and pour it over the ingredients in the jar, making sure to cover them, and leaving about 1/2-inch headroom in the jar. Seal the jar, and place it in a cool, dark spot for three weeks, before opening.

Whisk 2 tablespoons olive oil, pressed garlic cloves and oregano in medium bowl to blend. Season with salt and pepper. Add sea scallops and toss to coat with oil mixture.
Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat) or preheat broiler. Alternate 3 scallops, 3 lemon slices and 2 bay leaves on each skewer. Grill or broil brochettes until scallops are golden brown and just cooked through, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer to plates and serve.

Poached chicken: In a 1 1/2-quart saucepan bring water to a boil with gingerroot; Scotch or Sherry, and salt to taste. Add chicken and simmer, covered, 12 minutes, or until just cooked through. Transfer chicken with tongs to a bowl and chill, covered, 20 minutes.
Make ginger scallion oil while chicken is cooling:
In a small bowl stir together ginger scallion oil ingredients.
Halve chicken lengthwise and cut across grain into thin slices. Stir oil and spoon over chicken.

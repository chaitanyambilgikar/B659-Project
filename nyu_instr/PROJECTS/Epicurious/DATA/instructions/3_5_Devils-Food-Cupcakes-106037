For the cupcakes, preheat the oven to 350°F. Line16 muffin cups with liners.
Melt the chocolate in a double boiler over hot, not simmering, water. Remove the pan from the heat.
Sift the sugar, flour, baking soda, and salt together into a large bowl. In a medium bowl, whisk together the hot coffee, sour cream, and vegetable oil. Gradually whisk in the eggs, then stir in the chocolate. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir until all the ingredients are smoothly blended.
Fill the cupcake liners about two-thirds full. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center of a cupcake comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool completely on a wire rack.
For the frosting, melt the chocolate in a double boiler over hot, not simmering, water. Place the milk, sugar, and salt in a medium bowl and stir until the sugar is dissolved, about 2 minutes. Add the chocolate in a slow stream and mix until thoroughly blended. Refrigerate for about 30 minutes before using. Frost the cupcakes with the frosting.

In a fine sieve rinse rice under cold running water and drain. In a small heavy saucepan bring 2 cups water to a boil and stir in rice. Simmer rice, uncovered, until just tender but grains are not open, about 40 minutes. Drain rice in sieve and rinse under cold running water. Drain rice well and transfer to a bowl. Rice may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered. Bring rice to room temperature before proceeding.
Lightly beat egg and stir into rice with chives and salt and pepper to taste.
In a large non-stick skillet heat 1 tablespoon oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking. Drop heaping teaspoons rice mixture into skillet without crowding and cook, flattening griddlecakes slightly with a spatula (griddlecakes should be about 1 1/2 to 2 inches in diameter), until golden brown, about 1 1/2 minutes on each side. Transfer griddlecakes as cooked to paper towels to drain and season with salt and pepper. Make more griddlecakes in same manner with remaining rice mixture and oil.
Cool griddlecakes slightly and top with sour cream and caviar. Garnish griddlecakes with chives.

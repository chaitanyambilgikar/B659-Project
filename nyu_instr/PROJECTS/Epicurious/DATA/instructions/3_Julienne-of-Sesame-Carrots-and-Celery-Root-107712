Cook butter in heavy large deep skillet over medium heat until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Add celery root and carrots; toss to coat with butter. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook until carrots and celery root are crisp-tender, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. Add all sesame seeds, sesame oil, lemon juice, and salt; toss to coat. Cook 2 minutes longer to blend flavors. Transfer to bowl.

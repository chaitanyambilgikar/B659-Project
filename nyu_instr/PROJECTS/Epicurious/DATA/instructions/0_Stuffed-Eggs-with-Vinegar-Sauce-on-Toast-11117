Cut eggs in half lengthwise and remove yolks. Press yolks through a fine sieve into a small bowl and reserve 1 tablespoon yolk on a small plate, covered. In small bowl with yolks stir together crème fraîche, 1 teaspoon vinegar, garlic, 1 teaspoon parsley, and salt and pepper to taste.
Fill whites with yolk mixture and smooth tops.
In a small non-stick skillet heat butter over moderate heat and cook eggs, cut sides down, without turning, until heated through, about 3 minutes. Remove eggs from skillet with a slotted spoon and keep warm. Whisk in remaining 2 teaspoon vinegar, shallots, and broth and cook, whisking, until reduced slightly, about 1 minute. Add reserved sieved egg yolk and whisk until smooth. Add 1 teaspoon parsley and season with salt and pepper. Spoon sauce over toasted bread slices and top with eggs and additional parsley.

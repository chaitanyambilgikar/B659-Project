Make Egg Sauce: 1. Beat the egg yolks in a bowl. Add the lemon juice and the soy sauce and mix.
2. Add the clarified butter gradually so that it doesn’t separate, mixing as you go.
Yield: 3/4 cup (150 ml).
Make Asparagus: 1. Bring about 3 inches (8 cm) of oil in a medium saucepan to 340°F (170°C). Deep-fry the asparagus spears for 1 to 2 minutes, drain and sprinkle with a little sea salt. Cut the spears in half.
2. Line a serving dish with the Egg Sauce. Arrange the asparagus in it in 2 or 3 layers. Spoon the salmon roe on top.

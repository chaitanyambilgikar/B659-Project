1. Combine the milk, honey and yeast in the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with a dough hook (this can also be done by hand in a large bowl if you don't have a mixer). Turn the mixer on to distribute the yeast. Add the flour and turn the mixer to medium speed. Once the flour has begun to absorb the liquid, add the eggs, one at a time. When the eggs are incorporated add the schmaltz, then the salt, and mix on high until all the ingredients are well incorporated, 3 to 5 minutes.
2. Cover the mixing bowl with a lid or with plastic wrap and let the dough ferment and rise till it's doubled in size, about 3 hours (less if your kitchen is hot).
3. Grease your cooking vessel (see below).
4. Re-knead the dough by hand to redistribute the yeast and knock some of the gas out. Shape as desired: form into balls and place in a cake pan or springform mold for dinner rolls, in individual ramekins or a muffin pan, or put the whole dough ball as is in a terrine mold or loaf pan. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 8 to 36 hours.
5. Remove the dough from the refrigerator 1-1/2 to 2 hours before baking (shorter if they're in individual portions, longer if a single loaf). Preheat your oven to 350°F/180°C. When they've reached room temperature and have started to rise, bake them. Individual portions will take about 25 minutes, whole loaves will take about 45 minutes. If you're uncertain about doneness, insert an instant-read thermometer- they're done when they've reached an internal temperature of 200°F/95°C. The crust should be an appealing golden brown.
6. This dough can also be frozen after the fermentation stage. Shape or mold it, wrap it twice in plastic, and freeze. To bake the dough, refrigerate it for 24 hours, then allow it to temper and rise at room temperature for 2 hours before baking.

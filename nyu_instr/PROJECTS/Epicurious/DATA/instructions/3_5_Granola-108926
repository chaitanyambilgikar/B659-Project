Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 375°F. Line a large shallow baking pan with foil and oil foil.
Toss together oats, almonds, coconut, and salt in a large bowl. Whisk together oil and honey, then stir into oat mixture until well coated. Spread mixture in baking pan and bake, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Stir in cranberries and raisins, then cool completely in pan on a rack.

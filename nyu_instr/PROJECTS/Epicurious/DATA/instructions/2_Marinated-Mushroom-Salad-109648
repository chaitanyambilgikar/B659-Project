Wrap whole peppercorns and seeds in a small square of cheesecloth and tie into a bundle with string, then put in a 3-quart saucepan along with water, oil, zest, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, and shallots. Bring to a simmer over moderate heat, then reduce heat to moderately low and simmer, covered, 10 minutes. Add mushrooms and bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, covered, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 12 minutes. Transfer mushrooms to a bowl with a slotted spoon, then increase heat and boil cooking liquid until reduced to about 3/4 cup.
Discard cheesecloth bag and zest, then stir salt and ground pepper into broth. Pour through a fine-mesh sieve into bowl with mushrooms. Cool to room temperature and stir in parsley and remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice.

In a small bowl whisk together the oil, the butter, and salt and pepper to taste. Arrange the potato slices, not touching, in rows on an oiled baking sheet, brush them with the oil mixture, and roast them in the upper third of a preheated 450°F. oven, turning them once with a spatula, for 18 to 22 minutes, or until they are golden and crisp. Transfer the potatoes to paper towels to drain, sprinkle them with the coarse salt and pepper to taste, and serve them warm.

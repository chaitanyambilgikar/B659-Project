Cook carrots with oil and cumin in a 3-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat, stirring, until well coated, about 1 minute. Add remaining ingredients and simmer, uncovered, shaking pan occasionally, until liquid is evaporated and carrots are tender and glazed, about 20 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.

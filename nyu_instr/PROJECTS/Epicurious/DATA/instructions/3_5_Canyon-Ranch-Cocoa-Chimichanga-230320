Preheat oven to 350°F. Lightly coat a baking sheet with cooking spray. In a medium bowl, combine bananas, chocolate sauce, and 1 tsp cinnamon. Set aside. In a small bowl, combine 1 tsp cinnamon and sugar. Set aside. Lay out 1 sheet phyllo onto a flat surface. Spray lightly with cooking spray and fold in half lengthwise. Turn sheet so one of the narrower ends is facing you. Place 1/6 mixture about 1 inch from the bottom and about 1 inch from each side. Roll one quarter of the length of the phyllo, then fold in sides and continue rolling the length of the phyllo (as you would a burrito or wrap). Repeat with remaining phyllo sheets and place on baking sheet with open flap down. Lightly spray the exterior of chimichangas with cooking spray and dust with cinnamon-sugar mixture. Place in oven immediately and bake 10 to 15 minutes or until golden brown.

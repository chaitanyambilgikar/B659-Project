Place couscous in large bowl. Bring 2 2/3 cups water, 1/2 cup sugar and oil to boil in heavy large saucepan, stirring to dissolve sugar. Pour mixture over couscous and stir until well blended. Cover and let stand 10 minutes. Fluff with fork to separate grains. Mix nuts and dates into couscous. Transfer couscous to 13x9x2-inch baking dish. Cool. Cover with foil. (Can be prepared 4 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.)
Preheat oven to 350°F. Bake couscous until heated through, about 20 minutes. Spoon into bowls. Serve, passing hot milk and additional sugar separately.

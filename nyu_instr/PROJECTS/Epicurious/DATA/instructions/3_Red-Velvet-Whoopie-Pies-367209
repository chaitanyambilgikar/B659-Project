Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.
In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the egg and mix well, scraping down the sides of the bowl with a large spatula. Add the vanilla and food coloring and mix well.
In a separate large mixing bowl, whisk together the sweet rice flour blend, cocoa powder, and salt. With the mixer on low, add half the flour blend mixture, then the buttermilk, and finally the rest of the flour blend mixture to the butter mixture and mix well.
In a small bowl stir the vinegar and baking soda together and then stir into the batter. Using a large spatula, scrape down the bottom and sides of the mixing bowl and make sure all the ingredients are incorporated. Drop the batter onto the prepared baking sheets using a small ice cream scoop or large tablespoon.
Bake the cookies for 7 to 9 minutes, or until the edges are set and the cookies are firm but springy to the touch. Cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. While the cookies are cooling, make the filling.
In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on medium speed, cream together the cream cheese, butter, salt, and vanilla until smooth. Turn the mixer off. Sift in the confectioners' sugar and starting with the mixer on low speed and slowly increasing the speed to medium, mix well.
With your hand, brush the crumbs off the bottom (flat side) of a cookie, spread with a generous amount of filling, then top with another cookie, flat side down on the filling. Repeat with remaining cookies and filling.
The cookies should be stored in the refrigerator but are best eaten un-chilled, so take them out of the refrigerator 10 t0 15 minutes prior to serving.

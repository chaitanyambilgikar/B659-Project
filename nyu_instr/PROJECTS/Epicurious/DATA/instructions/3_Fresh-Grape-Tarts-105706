Puree 1 1/2 cups grapes in processor. Strain grape puree, pressing on solids to extract as much juice as possible. Pour 1/2 cup grape juice into large bowl; discard any remaining juice. Cut 4 3/4 cups grapes lengthwise in half; add all grapes to juice in bowl. Add sugar, 6 tablespoons flour, and lemon juice; toss to blend well. Let stand 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Preheat oven to 375°F. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Roll out 1 pastry sheet on lightly floured surface to 11-inch square. Cut off just enough pastry from corners to form rough circle. Transfer pastry to 1 prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon flour over center of pastry, leaving 2 1/2-inch plain border. Spoon half of grape mixture, including juices, into center of pastry. Fold pastry edges up over grapes, forming 2- to 2 1/2-inch border. Dot grapes with 1 tablespoon butter. Repeat with remaining ingredients for second tart.
Bake tarts until crusts are golden brown and grape juices are bubbling, about 45 minutes (crust border will unfold slightly). Cool tarts to room temperature. (Can be prepared 6 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.)

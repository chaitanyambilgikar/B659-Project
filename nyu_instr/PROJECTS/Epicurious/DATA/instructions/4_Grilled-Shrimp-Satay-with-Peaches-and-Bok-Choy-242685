Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Whisk first 5 ingredients and 5 tablespoons nectar until smooth; season sauce with pepper.
Arrange peaches, shrimp, and bok choy on grill. Brush with 4 tablespoons nectar; brush lightly with 1/4 cup sauce. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill until peaches are slightly charred, shrimp are just opaque in center, and bok choy halves are just tender, about 2 minutes per side for peaches and 3 minutes per side for shrimp and bok choy.
Mound shrimp, bok choy, and peaches on platter. Drizzle with some sauce. Serve with remaining sauce.
*Available in the Asian foods section of many supermarkets and at Asian markets.

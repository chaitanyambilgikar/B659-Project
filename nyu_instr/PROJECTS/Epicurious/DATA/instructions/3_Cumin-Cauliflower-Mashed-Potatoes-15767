Peel and quarter potatoes. Cut cauliflower into 1 1/2-inch florets. In a 5- to 6-quart kettle cover potatoes with salted cold water by 2 inches and simmer 20 minutes. Add cauliflower and simmer until vegetables are very tender, about 10 minutes. Drain vegetables in a colander and transfer to a large bowl. With a potato masher mash potato mixture.
In a dry heavy skillet toast cumin seeds over moderate heat, stirring, until fragrant. In a bowl whisk together buttermilk and ground cumin. Stir mixture into potatoes with cumin seeds until combined well and season with salt and pepper. Potatoes may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered. Reheat potatoes, covered, in a 350°F. oven about 30 minutes.
Serve potatoes drizzled with oil and garnished with cilantro.

Preheat oven to 325°F with rack in middle.
Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat, then stir in sauces and Cajun seasoning.
Toss pecans with butter mixture in a bowl until well coated. Spread out in a large shallow baking pan and bake until crisp and browned, 20 to 30 minutes. Season lightly with salt, then cool. (Pecans will crisp even more as they cool.)

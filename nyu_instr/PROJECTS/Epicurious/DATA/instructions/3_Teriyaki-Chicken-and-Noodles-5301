Cook noodles in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender. Drain well; return to pot. Add sesame oil and toss to coat.
Heat vegetable oil in heavy large skillet over high heat. Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper. Add chicken to skillet and sauté until no longer pink, about 2 minutes. Add sliced green onions, carrot and crushed red pepper. Stir-fry until vegetables are crisp-tender but still bright in color and chicken is cooked through, about 2 minutes longer. Add noodles and teriyaki sauce and toss to blend well.

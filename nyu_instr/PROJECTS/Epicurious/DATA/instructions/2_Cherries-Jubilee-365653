Melt butter in a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Add sugar and stir until dissolved. Add cherries and salt; stir to coat. Cook cherries, stirring occasionally, until juices are released and begin to reduce slightly, about 10 minutes. Remove pan from heat and stir in bourbon. Return pan to heat and simmer until juices thicken, about 5 minutes. Season to taste with lemon juice. Let cool slightly.
Spoon warm cherry mixture over ice cream.

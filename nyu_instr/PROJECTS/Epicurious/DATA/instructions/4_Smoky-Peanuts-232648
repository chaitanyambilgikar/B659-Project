Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Whisk together egg white, sugar, tea, and salt in a small bowl. Stir in peanuts and spread in 1 layer on baking sheet.
Bake, stirring occasionally, until nuts are dry, about 7 minutes. Cool on baking sheet on a rack, about 20 minutes. (Nuts will crisp as they cool.)

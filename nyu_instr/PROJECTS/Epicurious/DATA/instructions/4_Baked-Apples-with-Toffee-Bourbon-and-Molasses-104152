Preheat oven to 350°F. Peel skin off top third of each apple. Using small melon baller, scoop out stem and core, leaving bottom intact. Stand apples in 11x7x2-inch baking dish. Place 2 tablespoons toffee bits around apples in dish. Divide remaining bits among cavities of apples. Add 1/2 tablespoon bourbon and 1/2 tablespoon butter to cavity of each apple. Whisk cider, molasses, sugar and ginger in bowl; spoon over and around apples.
Bake apples until tender, basting often with pan juices, about 1 hour 20 minutes. Transfer apples to bowls. Pour juices from dish into small saucepan. Boil juices until thick enough to coat spoon, about 6 minutes. Spoon sauce over apples. Serve apples warm with vanilla ice cream.

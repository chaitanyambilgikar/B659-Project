Preheat oven to 350°F.
Cook noodles in a large saucepan of boiling salted water* until tender, then drain well in a colander and toss with butter in a bowl.
While noodles are cooking, whisk together eggs, cottage cheese, sour cream, salt, and white pepper in a large bowl. Stir in noodles.
Transfer to a buttered deep 1-quart baking dish and bake in middle of oven until firm, 45 minutes to 1 hour.
* When salting water for cooking, use 1 tablespoon salt for every 4 quarts water.

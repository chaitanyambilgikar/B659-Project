In a small bowl proof the yeast in the water for 5 minutes, or until the mixture is foamy. In a small saucepan heat the milk with the molasses and the butter until the mixture is just lukewarm and the butter is melted and remove the pan from the heat. In a large bowl stir together the yeast mixture, the milk mixture, the aniseed, the caraway seeds, the salt, the zest, the rye flour, and 3 cups of the unbleached flour until the mixture is combined well, turn the dough out onto a floured surface, and knead it for 8 to 10 minutes, adding as much of the remaining 1 cup unbleached flour as is necessary to form a smooth and elastic dough. Transfer the dough to a buttered large bowl, turning it to coat it with the butter, and let it rise, covered with plastic wrap, in a warm place for 1 1/2 hours, or until it is double in bulk.
Punch down the dough, turn it out onto a floured surface, and knead it a few times. Divide the dough in half, form each half into a round loaf, and transfer the loaves to a buttered large baking sheet. Let the loaves rise, covered with a kitchen towel, in a warm place for 1 hour, or until they are almost double in bulk.
Preheat the oven to 375°F. Prick the loaves with a fork to form a decorative pattern and bake them in the middle of the oven for 30 to 40 minutes, or until they are browned and sound hollow when the bottoms are tapped. Transfer the loaves to a rack and let them cool.

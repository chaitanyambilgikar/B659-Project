Bring water, 1 tablespoon oil, and salt to a boil in a 2-quart saucepan, then stir in rice. Return to a boil and cover pan. Reduce heat to low and simmer rice until water is absorbed and rice is tender, about 15 minutes. Fluff rice with a fork and let stand, covered, 5 minutes.
While rice is simmering, cook lentils in a saucepan of boiling water until just tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain in a sieve.
Spread rice and lentils in a shallow baking pan and cool 10 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and toss gently with remaining 2 tablespoons oil, remaining ingredients, and salt and pepper to taste.

Heat some olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add garlic; swirl for 1 minute, just until fragrant.
Remove garlic and add spinach and a generous pinch of salt. Cook, cutting the leaves with kitchen scissors as they wilt.
When the spinach has wilted, transfer it to a platter, and squeeze the juice from lemon over it.

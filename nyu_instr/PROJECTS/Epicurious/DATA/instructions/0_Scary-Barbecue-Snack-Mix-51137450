Heat oven to 300°F with rack in middle. Grease rimmed baking sheet with oil.
Combine popcorn, tortilla chips, cheese crackers, and corn nuts in a large bowl.
Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Remove pan from heat and whisk in barbecue sauce, Worcestershire sauce, sugar, paprika, chili and garlic powders, and Tabasco, if using.
Drizzle barbecue sauce mixture over snack mix and stir until combined well.
Evenly spread mixture in baking sheet and bake, stirring and turning mixture over every 10 minutes, for a total of 40 minutes. Cool in pan on a wire rack (it will crisp as it cools), then break into pieces.

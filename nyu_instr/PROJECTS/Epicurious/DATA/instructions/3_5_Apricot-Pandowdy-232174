Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 400°F.
Toss apricots with cornstarch and 1/2 cup sugar until coated.
Heat butter in a 10-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat until foam subsides, then stir in apricot mixture. Bring to a boil, stirring frequently, then immediately transfer to a 9-inch pie plate.
Fold pie dough into quarters and trim 1 inch from rounded edge. Unfold (trimmed round should be 8 inches in diameter) and put on top of fruit. Brush pastry with milk and sprinkle with remaining tablespoon sugar.
Bake until apricot filling is bubbling and crust is golden, about 20 minutes. Cool 10 minutes before serving.

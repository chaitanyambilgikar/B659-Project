Preheat oven to 350°F and butter six 1/2-cup ramekins.
Discard crust from bread and tear enough bread into large pieces to measure 2 1/2 cups. Cut away rind from goat cheese, discarding it, and crumble cheese into 1/4-inch pieces. Mince rosemary leaves. In a food processor pulse bread in 2 batches until mostly coarse crumbs (there will be some fine crumbs). In a bowl toss together bread crumbs, goat cheese, and rosemary leaves.
In a large bowl whisk together eggs, cream, milk, and salt and pepper to taste and stir in bread crumb mixture until combined well. Divide mixture evenly among ramekins. Put ramekins in a roasting pan and add enough hot water to pan to reach halfway up sides of ramekins. Bake puddings in middle of oven until puffed and golden, about 35 minutes. Transfer ramekins to a rack and cool puddings 10 minutes (puddings will sink as they cool). Serve puddings warm.

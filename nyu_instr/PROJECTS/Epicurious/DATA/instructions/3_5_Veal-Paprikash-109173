Melt lard in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add onions; cover skillet and cook until onions are soft, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. Add shallot; increase heat to medium-high and sauté until onions are golden, about 5 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer onions and shallot to small bowl.
Sprinkle veal with salt and pepper. Working in batches, add veal scallops to drippings in skillet and sauté until browned, about 1 minute per side, adding more lard as needed and transferring veal to plate after each batch. Return onion mixture to skillet. Add tomatoes with juice, sweet paprika, hot paprika, and marjoram. Simmer 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Return veal and any accumulated juices to sauce. Simmer 1 minute, turning veal to coat. Using slotted spoon, transfer veal to platter. Mix sour cream into sauce and heat through (do not boil). Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper. Pour over veal and serve.

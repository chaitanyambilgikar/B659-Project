Preheat oven to 400°F. Combine fennel wedges, thyme, and 4 tablespoons oil in large bowl; toss to coat. Arrange fennel, cut side down, on large rimmed baking sheet. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Roast until fennel is tender and brown, turning once, about 40 minutes. Discard thyme sprigs. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.
Whisk vinegar, mustard, and 2 tablespoons oil in large bowl. Season dressing with salt and pepper. Add fennel, orange slices, and arugula. Toss to coat. Transfer salad to large shallow bowl.
What to drink: To accompany the spicy, citrusy salad, pour a crisp white with mineral notes. The Kupelwieser 2008 Pinot Grigio Alto Adige ($15) would be perfect.

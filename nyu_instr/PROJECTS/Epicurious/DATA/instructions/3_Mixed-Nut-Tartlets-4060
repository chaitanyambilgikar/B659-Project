Preheat oven to 375°F. Roll out crust dough on lightly floured surface to 16-inch round (scant 1/8 inch thick). Cut out 3-inch rounds. Gather and reroll dough scraps. Cut out enough rounds to make 18 total. Spray 3-inch-diameter fluted tartlet pans with 1/2-inch-high sides with nonstick spray. Line prepared pans with dough rounds. Freeze crusts 15 minutes.
Arrange tartlet pans on large baking sheets. Bake crusts until pale golden, piercing bottoms with toothpick if crusts bubble, about 13 minutes. Cool crusts on baking sheets.
For filling: Bring cream, sugar, honey and butter to boil in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat, stirring until sugar dissolves. Boil without stirring 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Mix in Grand Marnier, then nuts. Refrigerate until filling is thick, stirring occasionally, about 45 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375°F. Divide filling among prepared crusts. Bake tartlets on baking sheets until filling is golden brown and bubbles, about 12 minutes (filling may bubble over). Transfer tartlets to rack; cool 5 minutes. Using tip of small sharp knife, cut around crusts to loosen. Remove tartlets from pans. Cool completely on racks.

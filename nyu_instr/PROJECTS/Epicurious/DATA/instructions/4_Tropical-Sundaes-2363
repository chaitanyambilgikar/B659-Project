For sauce: Combine first 6 ingredients in heavy medium saucepan. Stir over medium heat until sugars dissolve. Boil gently until reduced to 1 cup, stirring frequently, about 15 minutes. Cool to lukewarm. Discard ginger pieces and add minced ginger. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and store at room temperature. Reheat to lukewarm, whisking occasionally, before serving.)
For sundaes: Scoop ice cream into balloon glasses or sundae dishes. Spoon lukewarm sauce over. Top with fruit. Sprinkle with coconut and serve.

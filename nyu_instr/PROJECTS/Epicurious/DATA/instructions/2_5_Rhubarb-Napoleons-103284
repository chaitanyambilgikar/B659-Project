For pastry: Preheat oven to 400°F. Using 1/2 tablespoon butter, generously butter 1 baking sheet. Unfold pastry on work surface; sprinkle with 2 tablespoons sugar. Roll out pastry to 11-inch square. Trim edges to form 10-inch square. Cut square into four 5-inch squares. Cut squares diagonally in half to form 8 triangles. Transfer triangles, sugar side up, to prepared baking sheet. Using remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons butter, generously butter underside of second baking sheet. Place second sheet, buttered side down, atop pastry triangles.
Bake pastry triangles 15 minutes; press top baking sheet down to flatten. Bake until pastries are golden brown, about 10 minutes longer. Remove top baking sheet. Using metal spatula, transfer pastries to rack and cool completely.
For filling: Combine rhubarb, 2/3 cup sugar, orange juice, cornstarch and grated orange peel in medium saucepan; stir to blend. Let stand until juices form, about 10 minutes. Cook over medium-high heat until rhubarb is tender but still intact, stirring gently, about 7 minutes. Gently stir in red currant jelly. Cool 5 minutes. (Pastries and filling can be prepared 1 day ahead. Store pastries airtight at room temperature. Cover and refrigerate filling. Rewarm filling before using.)
Arrange 1 pastry triangle on each of 4 plates; top with rhubarb filling, then remaining 4 pastry triangles. Sprinkle with powdered sugar. Scoop ice cream alongside each napoleon. Garnish with orange peel strips and mint, if desired. Serve napoleons immediately.

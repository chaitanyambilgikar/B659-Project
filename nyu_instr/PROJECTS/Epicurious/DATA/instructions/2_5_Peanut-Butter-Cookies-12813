In a bowl cream together the shortening, the peanut butter, and the brown sugar, beating until the mixture is light and fluffy, beat in the egg, and stir in the flour, the baking soda, and the salt. Form tablespoonfuls of the dough into balls, transfer the balls as they are formed to baking sheets, and with the tines of a fork flatten them, making a crosshatch pattern. Bake the cookies in batches in the middle of a preheated 400°F. oven for 8 to 10 minutes, or until they are golden, transfer them to racks, and let them cool completely.

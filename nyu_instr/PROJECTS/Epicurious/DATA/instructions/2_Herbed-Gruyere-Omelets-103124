Whisk 3 eggs, 1 teaspoon chives, 1 teaspoon tarragon and 1 teaspoon parsley in bowl. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Preheat broiler. Melt 1 teaspoon butter in 8- to 9-inch-diameter nonstick skillet over medium heat. Pour egg mixture into skillet. Stir until eggs begin to set, lifting edge of omelet with spatula and tilting skillet to allow uncooked egg to flow underneath. Cook until omelet is softly set, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle packed 1/3 cup cheese down center of omelet. Roll up omelet; place in broilerproof baking dish large enough to hold 2 omelets. Repeat with remaining eggs, herbs, butter and 1/3 cup cheese to form second omelet. Sprinkle remaining 1/3 cup cheese over omelets.
Broil omelets until cheese is bubbling and slightly brown, about 2 minutes.

In a bowl whisk together 2 of the eggs, the granulated sugar, 2 tablespoons of the water, 1/4 teaspoon of the salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of the vanilla until the mixture is smooth and stir in the chocolate wafer crumbs, the chocolate chips, and half the butter. In another bowl whisk together the remaining 2 eggs, the brown sugar, the remaining 2 tablespoons water, the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon vanilla until the mixture is smooth and stir in the graham cracker crumbs, the pecans, and the remaining butter. Drop large spoonfuls of each mixture alternately into a greased 8-inch-square baking pan, run a knife blade through the mixtures to marble the batter, and smooth the top. Bake the brownies in the middle of a preheated 350°F. oven for 40 minutes, or until a tester comes out clean, and let them cool in the pan on a rack for 10 minutes. Cut the brownies into squares and let them cool completely.

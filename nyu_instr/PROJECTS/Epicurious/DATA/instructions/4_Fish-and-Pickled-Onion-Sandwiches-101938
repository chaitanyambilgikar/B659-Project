Wipe out skillet with paper towels. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and sauté until beginning to color, about 3 minutes. Add vinegar and 1 1/2 teaspoons thyme. Sauté until onion is golden and vinegar has evaporated, about 2 minutes longer. Season with salt and pepper.

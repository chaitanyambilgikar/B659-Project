Halve cucumber lengthwise, then slice diagonally 1/4 inch thick.
Stir together lime juice, water, fish sauce, sugar, red-pepper flakes, and shallot in a small bowl until sugar is dissolved.
Arrange pineapple and cucumber on a platter and drizzle with some of dressing. Drape roast beef slices on top and arrange mint alongside. Serve with remaining dressing on the side.

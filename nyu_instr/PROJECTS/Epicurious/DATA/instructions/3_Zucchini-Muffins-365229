1. Preheat oven to 350°F.
2. In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, brown sugar, and vanilla. Stir in the grated zucchini, canola oil, baking soda, and salt.
3. In a separate bowl, whisk the flour with the cinnamon and nutmeg. Add the dry ingredients to the zucchini mix and stir well. Finally, stir in the pecans and raisins.
4. Grease a 12-cup muffin tin with canola oil. Spoon the batter into the cups to fill them about 3/4 of the way. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until a toothpick or small knife inserted in a muffin comes out clean. (Alternatively, spoon the batter into a 8 x 5 x 3-inch loaf pan. Bake for 50 to 55 minutes or until the top of the loaf cracks and a toothpick or small knife inserted in the center of the loaf comes out clean.)
5. Transfer the pan to a wire rack to cool for about 20 minutes. Then run a small paring knife around each muffin and remove them from the muffin tin.

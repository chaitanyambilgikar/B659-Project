Fill a 4-quart kettle three fourths full with salted water and bring to a boil for penne. Cut prosciutto into thin strips and tear basil into pieces. Stir penne into boiling water and boil until al dente. Drain pasta in a colander and in a large bowl toss hot pasta with oil, prosciutto, basil, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and salt and pepper to taste.

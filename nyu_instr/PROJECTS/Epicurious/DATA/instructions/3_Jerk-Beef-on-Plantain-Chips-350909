Quarter beef lengthwise and pat dry. Season with 1/4 teaspoon salt and rub jerk paste all over beef.
Heat oil in a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Add beef and sear, turning, 4 to 5 minutes total. Let rest on a cutting board 5 minutes. Cut crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick slices.
Finely chop onions and cilantro together. Top plantain chips with beef, then with onion salsa.

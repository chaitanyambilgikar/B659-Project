Whisk 1/2 cup oil, vinegar, garlic and sugar in medium bowl to blend. Whisk in onion, tomatoes and 1/4 cup basil. Season dressing with salt and pepper. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle chicken on all sides with salt and pepper. Add chicken to skillet. Sauté until brown, about 3 minutes per side. Add broth, 1/2 cup dressing and 1/4 cup basil and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer uncovered until chicken is cooked through, about 3 minutes. Remove skillet from heat. Transfer chicken to work surface and slice thinly.
Divide pasta among 4 plates. Top each with 1 sliced chicken breast half. Spoon pan juices over. Garnish with remaining 1/4 cup basil. Serve, passing remaining dressing separately.

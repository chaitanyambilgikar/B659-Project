Peel and wash 2 carrots with tops and 3 turnips with tops. Wash and de-string 2 handfuls of French beans. Cut these vegetables into very small dice (brunoise).
Shell a handful of fresh peas.
Heat salted water in a saucepan and prepare a bowl of water and ice cubes.
Immerse all the vegetables in the boiling water for 4 minutes, then drain and plunge them in the ice water. Drain once more, put in a large bowl, and set aside.
Pour 3 quarts of water and 1 3/4 cups of white wine into a large cooking pot. Add 10 black peppercorns and bring to a boil. Plunge a 1 1/2-pound lobster into the liquid, put on the lid, and cook for 5 minutes once it returns to a boil.
Take the lobster out and, as soon as it's not burning hot, shell the tail, elbows, and claws. Remove the black intestinal vein. Take the sand sac from the head and collect the coral.
Cut the shell of the head and tail in half lengthwise. Rinse and dry them.
Cut up the meat and add it to the bowl of vegetables.
Trim, wash, and finely chop 2 scallions and put them in a bowl. Add the lobster coral, 1/2 cup Greek-style yogurt, the juice of an unwaxed lemon, a little of its grated zest, and a pinch of Piment d'Espelette or hot paprika. Taste and correct the seasoning with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Pour this sauce into the bowl of vegetables and lobster. Stir gently, then distribute this mixture into the shells of the half tails and half heads.
Arrange on a dish and keep cold until serving.

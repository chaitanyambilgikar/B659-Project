Purée anchovies, garlic, oil, salt, and pepper in a blender until smooth.
Prepare grill for direct-heat cooking over medium-hot charcoal (moderate heat for gas).
Brush both sides of baguette slices with some of anchovy dressing, then grill bread, turning over occasionally, until toasted, 1 to 2 minutes. Add egg and lemon juice to dressing in blender and blend until emulsified, 1 to 2 minutes. Season with salt.
Cut romaine hearts in half lengthwise, then grill, cut sides down, covered only if using a gas grill, until grill marks just appear, about 2 minutes. Cut romaine crosswise into 2-inch-wide strips and transfer to a bowl.
Halve or quarter toasts and add to romaine along with Parmigiano-Reggiano.
Toss salad with just enough dressing to coat and serve immediately.

Combine 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour and yeast in large bowl. Heat milk, honey and sesame oil in heavy large saucepan over medium heat to 115&F., stirring occasionally. Remove saucepan from heat. Add milk mixture to dry ingredients. Stir in egg yolk, remaining 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, cracked wheat and salt. Mix in enough all purpose flour 1/2 cup at a time to form soft, slightly sticky dough. Knead on lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, adding more all purpose flour if very sticky, about 10 minutes.
Lightly oil large bowl. Add dough, turning to coat entire surface. Cover bowl with kitchen towel. Let dough rise in warm draft-free area until doubled in volume, about 1 3/4 hours.
Grease cookie sheet. Punch dough down. Mix in sunflower seeds and 2 1/2 tablespoons sesame seeds. Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface and knead until smooth. Divide dough in half. Pat each half into 1 1/2-inch-thick round. Place on prepared sheet. Cover and let rise in warm draft-free area until almost doubled, about 1 1/4 hours.
Preheat oven to 375&F. Using sharp knife, cut 1/8-inch-deep, 1-inch-diameter circle in center of one round. Starting at outside of circle, cut 1/8-inch-deep slit to edge of loaf. Repeat 4 more times, spacing evenly apart and dividing bread into fifths. Repeat with second loaf. Beat egg white with 1 tablespoon water. Brush over loaves. Sprinkle pecans in center of each loaf. Sprinkle oats, caraway seeds, fennel seeds, poppy seeds and 2 teaspoons sesame seeds into divided spaces.
Bake until loaves are brown and sound hollow when tapped on bottom, about 50 minutes. Transfer to racks and cool slightly. Serve bread warm or at room temperature.

Stir together ricotta, 2 tablespoons honey, thyme, 1 tablespoon basil, 1 tablespoon mint, and a pinch of salt.
Halve pears lengthwise and scoop out core with a melon-ball cutter or spoon. Leaving stem end intact, cut each pear half lengthwise into 1/8-inch-thick slices and gently press against a work surface to create a fan shape.
Divide cheese mixture among plates and top with a pear half. Drizzle remaining 3 tablespoons honey over pears and sprinkle evenly with pine nuts and remaining tablespoon each of basil and mint.

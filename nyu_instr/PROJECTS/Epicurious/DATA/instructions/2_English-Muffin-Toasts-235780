Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 375°F.
Cut muffins crosswise (not horizontally) into 1/3-inch-thick strips. Arrange muffin strips, cut sides down, in 1 layer on a large baking sheet, then brush strips evenly with all of butter. Bake, moving darker toasts to center and paler toasts to edges of sheet, until tops are pale golden, 10 to 15 minutes. Turn slices over and bake until toasts are golden on both sides, about 10 minutes more. Sprinkle buttered sides of toasts with salt, then serve warm or at room temperature.

Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add garlic; stir 30 seconds. Add eggplant, zucchini, bell pepper, onion and oregano. Cover and cook until vegetables begin to soften, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. Mix in tomatoes and vinegar. Reduce heat to medium. Cover; cook until vegetables are very tender, about 25 minutes longer. Season with salt and pepper.
Meanwhile, preheat oven to 375°F. Lightly oil 13 x 9 x 2-inch glass baking dish. Sprinkle fish with salt and pepper; arrange in prepared dish.
Spoon ratatouille over fish. Bake uncovered until fish is just opaque in center, about 20 minutes.

1 In a large bowl, smash the strawberries into the yogurt, stirring to combine.
2 Pour the mixture into a shallow pan (a metal baking pan works) and place it in the freezer, uncovered, for 1 hour.
3 Remove the pan from the freezer and stir the yogurt well, breaking up any clusters of ice crystals that have formed.
4 Return it to the freezer. Continue stirring every half hour, breaking up new clusters as they form, until the granita is completely frozen but scoopable, about 2 more hours.
5 Scoop and serve, garnished with fresh berries, if desired. (Store any leftovers in the freezer in a covered container or resealable plastic bag.)

Pat beef dry. Heat oil in a large heavy pot over medium-high heat until it shimmers, then cook beef, stirring occasionally, until browned and beginning to exude liquid, 3 to 4 minutes. Add onions, garlic, caraway seeds, and marjoram and cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are translucent, about 5 minutes. Add flour and cook, stirring frequently, until mixture sticks to bottom of pot and is deep golden, about 10 minutes. Add tomato paste and cook, stirring, 1 minute, then stir in hot water and 1/2 teaspoon paprika. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally, then simmer, partially covered, stirring occasionally, until meat breaks apart when pressed with a spoon, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Chill, uncovered, until cool, then covered overnight (at least 8 hours).
Remove solidified fat if desired, then bring soup to a simmer and remove from heat. Transfer meat with a slotted spoon to a bowl and coarsely shred with 2 forks. Return meat to soup and stir in ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, cayenne, sea salt, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon paprika and reheat over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Thin soup with water to desired consistency and season with salt and pepper.

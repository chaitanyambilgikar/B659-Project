Combine broth, potatoes and bay leaves in heavy large saucepan. Bring to boil. Reduce heat, cover partially and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer potatoes to large bowl. Add wine to broth and boil until reduced to 1/3 cup, about 12 minutes. Discard bay leaves. Return potatoes to pot. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
Stir potatoes over medium heat until heated through, about 4 minutes. Stir in chives. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer to bowl and serve.

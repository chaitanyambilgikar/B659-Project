Melt butter in heavy large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and sauté until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add rice; stir to coat with butter mixture, about 1 minute. Mix in broth, water, lemon juice, lemon peel and currants. Bring mixture to boil, stirring occasionally. Cover pan, reduce heat to medium-low and cook until liquids are absorbed and rice is tender, about 20 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Mix in almonds and serve.

Preheat oven to 400°F. Butter and flour six 3/4-cup ramekins or custard cups. Arrange dishes on rimmed baking sheet. Stir 1/2 cup butter and chocolate in small saucepan over low heat until melted and smooth. Using electric mixer, beat eggs, yolks, and 3/4 cup sugar in medium bowl until mixture is thick, about 8 minutes. Using rubber spatula, fold melted chocolate mixture, then flour into egg mixture. Divide batter among prepared ramekins. Bake until puddings are puffed and dry on top and tester inserted into center comes out with very moist crumbs still attached, about 12 minutes. Cool puddings 10 minutes.
Beat whipping cream, vanilla, and remaining 1 tablespoon sugar in medium bowl until peaks form.
Transfer ramekins to plates. Top each pudding with dollop of whipped cream.

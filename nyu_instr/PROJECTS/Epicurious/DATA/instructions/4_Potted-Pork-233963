Pulse pork shoulder and fresh pork fat together in 2 batches in a food processor until finely ground (be careful not to pulse to a smooth purée), transferring to a 2- to 2 1/2-quart heavy saucepan.
Add water, onion, garlic, bay leaves, salt, black pepper, and allspice to pork and bring to a boil, stirring to break up clumps. Reduce heat and simmer, partially covered, stirring occasionally, until meat is tender and liquid is still visible below surface of meat, 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 hours.
Discard bay leaves from pot, then transfer pork to 5 (8-oz) ramekins with a slotted spoon. Spoon remaining liquid over pork (use caution).
Place a small round of wax paper on surface of creton in each ramekin and chill until firm, at least 3 hours.
Let stand at room temperature 1 hour before serving.

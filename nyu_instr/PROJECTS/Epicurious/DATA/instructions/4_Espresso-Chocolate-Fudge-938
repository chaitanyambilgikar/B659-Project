Line 8-inch square glass baking dish with aluminum foil, overlapping sides. Combine bittersweet chocolate, marshmallow creme, unsweetened chocolate and vanilla extract in medium bowl. Mix water and espresso powder in heavy large saucepan until espresso powder dissolves. Add sugar, sweetened condensed milk, whipping cream and unsalted butter and stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves, brushing down sides of pan occasionally with wet pastry brush. Attach clip-on candy thermometer to side of pan. Increase heat to high and bring mixture to boil. Reduce heat to medium-heat and stir constantly but slowly with wooden spoon until candy thermometer registers 234°F, about 12 minutes.
Immediately pour mixture over ingredients in bowl (do not scrape pan). Stir mixture vigorously with wooden spoon until all chocolate melts and fudge thickens slightly, about 3 minutes. Transfer the fudge mixture to prepared baking dish. Smooth top of fudge in pan with rubber spatula. Refrigerate fudge uncovered until firm enough to cut, about 2 hours.
Using aluminum foil as aid, lift fudge from pan. Trim edges of fudge. Cut into 30 pieces. Melt white chocolate in top of double boiler over simmering water. Using fork, drizzle white chocolate decoratively over fudge. Press 1 espresso bean onto top of each piece of fudge. Place fudge in candy cups. Refrigerate fudge until white chocolate sets, about 20 minutes. (Fudge can be prepared week ahead. Store in airtight container in refrigerator. Bring fudge to room temperature before serving.)

Combine all ingredients except 1/2 tablespoon lemon juice in a 3-quart heavy saucepan and bring to a boil over moderate heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, until carrots are tender, 30 to 40 minutes.
Purée soup in 2 batches in a blender (use caution when blending hot liquids) until very smooth, then chill soup quickly, stirring occasionally, in a metal bowl set in a larger bowl of ice and cold water, about 30 minutes. (Alternatively, cool soup, uncovered, 30 to 40 minutes, then chill, covered, until cold, about 4 hours.)
Stir in remaining 1/2 tablespoon lemon juice and salt to taste. Divide soup among 6 bowls with a ladle. Float a lemon slice on top of each serving, then drizzle with honey and serve.

Make sauce: Combine chutney, lime juice and peel in processor; blend until almost smooth. Transfer to bowl. Whisk in mayonnaise. Season with salt and pepper.
Make sausages: Preheat oven to 425°F. Place sausages in 8 x 8 x 2-inch glass baking dish. Mix brown sugar, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, mustard and hot pepper sauce in small bowl to blend. Pour over sausages and toss to coat. (Sauce and sausages can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover separately and refrigerate.)
Bake sausages until heated through and brown in spots, turning occasionally, about 25 minutes.
Transfer sausages to platter. Place toothpick in each. Place chutney dipping sauce alongside and serve.

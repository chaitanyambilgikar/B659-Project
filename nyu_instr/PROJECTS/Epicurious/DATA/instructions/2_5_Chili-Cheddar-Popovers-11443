Preheat oven to 375°.F. Generously grease six 2/3-cup popover tins or nine 1/2-cup muffin tins.
In a bowl whisk together eggs, milk, and water. Add flour and salt, whisk mixture until combined well but still slightly lumpy. Whisk chili powder and cayenne into batter. Divide half of batter among tins. Sprinkle 1/4 cup Cheddar over batter in tins and divide remaining batter among tins. Sprinkle remaining 1/4 cup Cheddar over popovers and bake in lower third of oven 45 minutes. Cut a slit about 1/2 inch long on top of each popover with a small sharp knife and bake 10 minutes more.

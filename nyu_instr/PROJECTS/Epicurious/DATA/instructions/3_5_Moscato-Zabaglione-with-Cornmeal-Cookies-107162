For cookies: Using electric mixer, beat butter and 1/2 cup sugar in large bowl until fluffy. Beat in lemon peel and salt, then egg yolks. Beat in cornmeal, then flour. Stir in raisins. Knead dough just to combine; transfer to sheet of plastic wrap. Using plastic, form dough into 2x9-inch log. Chill until firm, 3 hours or up to 1 day.
Preheat oven to 325°F. Line large baking sheet with parchment paper. Slice dough log into 1/4-inch-thick rounds. Arrange rounds on prepared baking sheet, spacing 1 inch apart and reshaping into rounds if uneven. Bake cookies until golden at edges, about 15 minutes. Transfer to rack. Dust with powdered sugar and cool completely. (Can be made 3 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.)
For zabaglione: Whisk egg yolks and sugar in large metal bowl to blend; gradually whisk in Moscato. Set bowl over saucepan of simmering water (do not allow bowl to touch water). Whisk until mixture is thick and foamy and thermometer inserted into mixture registers 160°F, about 4 minutes. Divide zabaglione among 6 wineglasses. Serve immediately, passing cookies alongside.

Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add garlic and red pepper; sauté until garlic is golden, about 2 minutes. Add asparagus, tomatoes, stock and 1/4 cup sliced basil. Cook until asparagus is crisp-tender, about 8 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat.
Meanwhile, cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite. Drain. Transfer to large bowl.
Pour sauce over pasta. Add cheese, parsley and 1/4 cup chopped basil. Toss to coat. Season with salt and pepper.

In a large saucepan cover beets with salted water by 1 inch and simmer, covered, until tender, about 35 mintues. Drain beets in a colander and cool until they can be handled. Slip off and discard skins and stems. Beets may be prepared up to this point 3 days ahead and chilled, covered.
Make sauce: In a very small saucepan simmer sauce ingredients, stirring occasionally, until reduced to about 1/4 cup. Remove pan from heat and let sauce stand, covered, 15 minutes. Pour sauce through a fine sieve into a small bowl and cool. Sauce may be made 3 days ahead and chilled, covered. Bring sauce to room temperature before serving.
Make batter: In a bowl whisk together flour, mint, and salt and add water, whisking until combined (batter will be lumpy).
Cut beets into 1/4-inch-thick slices. In a deep 9-inch skillet heat oil over moderately high heat until 375°F. on a deep-fat thermometer. Working in batches, dip beet slices in batter and fry, without crowding, until golden and crisp, about 1 minute on each side, making sure oil returns to 375°F. before adding next batch. Transfer beets as fried to paper towels and drain. Beets may be made 2 hours ahead and reheated on a baking sheet in a 425°F. oven 10 minutes.
Serve beets with sauce on the side for dipping.

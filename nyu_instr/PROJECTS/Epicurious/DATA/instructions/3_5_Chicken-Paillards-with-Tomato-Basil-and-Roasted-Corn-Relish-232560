For relish: Preheat oven to 375°F. Brush rimmed baking sheet with 1 teaspoon oil. Toss corn and 2 teaspoons oil on prepared sheet. Roast until corn begins to brown, stirring occasionally, about 18 minutes. Transfer to bowl. Mix in tomatoes, green onions, basil, and 2 tablespoons oil; season with salt and pepper.
For chicken: Using mallet or heavy-bottomed saucepan, pound chicken between sheets of plastic wrap to about 1/2-inch thickness. Pat chicken dry. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, then dust with flour to coat. Melt butter with oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken to skillet and sauté until cooked through, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer to plates; top with relish and serve.

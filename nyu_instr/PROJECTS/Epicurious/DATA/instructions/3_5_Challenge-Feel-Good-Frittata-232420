Coat an 8-inch skillet with cooking spray; heat on high. Add pepper; cook about 5 minutes or until just tender. Add spinach and sauté 2 minutes or until leaves are wilted but still bright green. In a bowl, blend egg and egg whites with a whisk. Stir in feta and salt and pepper to taste. Pour over vegetables. Cook on medium heat until eggs set. Remove from heat. Place a plate on top of skillet and invert so frittata falls onto plate. Spray skillet again and return frittata to it to brown other side. Cook 1 minute. Serve with an orange and 1 piece whole-wheat toast.

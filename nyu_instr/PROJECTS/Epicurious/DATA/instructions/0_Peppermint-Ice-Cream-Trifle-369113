In a chilled metal bowl, mix ice cream, peppermint extract and food coloring. Refreeze ice cream at least 2 hours or up to 3 days. In a microwave-safe bowl, microwave chocolate and milk in 10-second intervals, stirring after each interval, until chocolate melts. Chill chocolate sauce until ready to use (up to 3 days); to reheat, microwave for 10 seconds. Pour half of chocolate sauce evenly among four 5-ounce serving glasses; scoop one quarter of ice cream into each glass; pour remaining half of chocolate sauce over ice cream. Garnish with pizzelle halves and candy canes; serve.

Preheat oven to 300°F. Place mixed nuts in large bowl. Heat vegetable oil in heavy small saucepan over medium heat. Add chili powder and cayenne pepper to taste and stir until aromatic, about 15 seconds. Pour over mixed nuts. Add sugar and salt and stir to blend. Transfer to baking pan. Bake until mixed nuts are toasted, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature. (Can be made 5 days ahead. Cover and store at room temperature.)

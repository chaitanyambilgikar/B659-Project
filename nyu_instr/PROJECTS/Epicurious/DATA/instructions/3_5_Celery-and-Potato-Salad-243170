Generously cover potatoes and eggs with cold water in a 4-quart pot with 1/2 tablespoon salt and bring to a boil, covered. Uncover and boil 10 minutes.
Transfer eggs with a slotted spoon to a bowl of cold water; continue to cook potatoes until tender, 10 to 15 minutes more.
While potatoes cook, whisk together vinegar and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a large bowl.
Drain potatoes and rinse with cold water until they have cooled to warm. Peel potatoes and cut into 1-inch pieces. Toss with vinegar mixture.
Peel eggs and coarsely chop, then add to potatoes along with remaining ingredients and salt and pepper to taste. Toss well.

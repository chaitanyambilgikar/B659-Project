Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium heat. Add onion and garlic. Cover and cook until onion is tender, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. Add tomatoes, chilis, chili powder and oregano and cook until tomatoes begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Stir in broth. Cover and simmer until vegetables are very tender, about 40 minutes. Puree in blender in batches; return to pot. (Can be prepared 3 days ahead; refrigerate. Return soup to simmer before continuing.)
Ladle soup into bowls. Serve, passing garnishes separately.

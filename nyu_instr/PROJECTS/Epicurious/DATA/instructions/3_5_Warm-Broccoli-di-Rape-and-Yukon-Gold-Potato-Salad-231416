Rinse and trim the broccoli di rape; cut the peeled stems into 4- or 5-inch lengths. Peel the potatoes, and cut into 1-inch cubes. Put the cubes in a pot with cold water to cover by several inches, and heat to a boil. Cook uncovered for about 5 minutes, then lay the greens and peeled stems on top of the potatoes, cover the pot, and cook for 5 minutes more.
Lift out the broccoli di rape and potatoes with a spider or other strainer, and lay them in a colander. Sprinkle about half the salt over the hot vegetables, let them drain and cool for a minute or two, then turn them into a mixing bowl. Drizzle the olive oil all over the pieces, and toss gently. Sprinkle on more salt and peperoncino to taste (I use 1/4 teaspoon pepper flakes, or even more, when I'm making this at home). Toss, taste, and adjust the seasoning.
Serve on a big warm platter, or put portions on warm salad plates.

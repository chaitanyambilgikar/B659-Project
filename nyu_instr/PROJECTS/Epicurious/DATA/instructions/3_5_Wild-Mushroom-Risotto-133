Rinse dried mushrooms briefly under running water to remove any dirt. Combine mushrooms and water in large pot. Cover and simmer over low heat until mushrooms are tender, about 5 minutes. Using slotted spoon, remove mushrooms from mushroom broth. Season broth with salt and pepper and reserve. Chop mushrooms.
Heat oil in heavy large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and garlic and sauté until tender, about 10 minutes. Add mushrooms and sage and stir 2 minutes. Mix in rice and continue stirring 1 minute. Pour in wine and simmer until liquid is absorbed, 3 minutes.
Add broth to rice and cook, stirring occasionally until rice is tender and very creamy, about 20 minutes. Stir in 1/2 cup Parmesan. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Ladle risotto into bowls and garnish with parsley. Serve, passing additional Parmesan separately.

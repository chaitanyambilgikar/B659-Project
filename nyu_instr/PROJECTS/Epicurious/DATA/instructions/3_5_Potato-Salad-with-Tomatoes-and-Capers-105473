Put the potatoes in a pot, cover with cold water by at least an inch, add a good pinch of salt, and bring to a boil. Cover partway, reduce the heat to medium, and cook until the potatoes are tender. Drain on a rack set in the sink and leave them there until cool enough to handle.
Peel the potatoes and cut them into 1/3-inch cubes. Drop them into a mixing bowl, separating the cubes as you go. Add the tomatoes, onion, olives, capers, parsley, and red pepper. Toss gently. Crumble the oregano over the top, pour in the oil, and toss gently.
Transfer the salad to a large serving dish. Drain the sardines and blot them with paper towels, then arrange them over the salad. Let this sit for 30 minutes, and serve it at room temperature.

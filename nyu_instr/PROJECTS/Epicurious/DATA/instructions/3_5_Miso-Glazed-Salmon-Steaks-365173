Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil; brush lightly with vegetable oil. Place salmon steaks on prepared baking sheet. Whisk miso, mirin, vinegar, ginger, and sesame oil in a small bowl to blend. Spread half the miso mixture over salmon steaks; season lightly with salt. Turn salmon steaks over and spread with remaining miso mixture; season lightly with salt. Cover with plastic wrap and let marinate at room temperature for at least 15 minutes, or refrigerate for up to 1 hour.
Position an oven rack 6"–8"from broiler and preheat. Broil salmon, turning once, until golden brown and just opaque in center, 10–12 minutes total.
Transfer salmon steaks to plates and serve with lime wedges.

In a small bowl sift together the flour, the baking powder, the granulated sugar, the ginger, and a pinch of salt. In a bowl combine well the pineapple, the banana, the milk, and the egg, add the flour mixture, and stir the batter until it is combined. In a kettle heat 1 1/2 inches of the oil until it registers 375°F. on a deep-fat thermometer, drop the batter by tablespoonfuls into the oil in batches, and fry the fritters, turning them, for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes, or until they are golden. Transfer the fritters with slotted spoon to paper towels to drain and sift the confectioners' sugar over them.

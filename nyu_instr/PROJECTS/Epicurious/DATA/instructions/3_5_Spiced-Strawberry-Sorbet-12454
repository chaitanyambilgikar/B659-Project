To make the spiced strawberry sorbet: In a saucepan combine sugar and water and bring to a boil, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Stir in peppercorns and remove pan from heat. Cover pan and let syrup stand 1 hour.
Strain syrup through a fine sieve into a food processor or blender and discard peppercorns. Purée hulled strawberries with syrup until very smooth and force though sieve into a bowl, discarding seeds and other solids. Stir in vinegar and chill, covered, until cold. Freeze mixture in an ice-cream maker.
Serve sorbet with crisps and strawberries.
To make the toasted almond and phyllo crisps: Preheat oven to 350°F.
In a food processor grind almonds with granulated sugar. (Almond sugar may be made 2 days ahead and kept in an airtight container at room temperature.)
On a work surface arrange 1 phyllo sheet and brush with some butter. Sprinkle sheet evenly with about 2 tablespoons almond sugar. Top sheet with remaining 5 phyllo sheets, brushing and sprinkling each in same manner. Trim edges of phyllo if uneven and cut into 24 rectangles, each about 4 by 2 inches. (Cut stacked phyllo lengthwise into 3 strips and cut each strip crosswise into eighths.) Cut each rectangle diagonally to form 2 triangles for a total of 48 cookies.
Arrange triangles, sugared sides up, in one layer on 2 heavy baking sheets and bake in batches in middle of oven until golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer crisps to racks and cool.
Sprinkle crisps with confectioners' sugar. (Crisps keep in an airtight container at room temperature 4 days.) Makes 48 crisps.

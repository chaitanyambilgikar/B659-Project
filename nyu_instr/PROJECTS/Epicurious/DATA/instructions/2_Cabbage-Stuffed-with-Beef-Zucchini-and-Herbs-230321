Heat oven to 350°F. Cut cabbages in half from top to base. Cut out core; discard. Pull out inner leaves of each half, leaving 3 outer layers (reserve). Finely slice inner leaves. Heat broth and 2 tbsp oil in a medium sauté pan on medium. Add vegetables (plus sliced cabbage), garlic, and beef. Cook until vegetables are tender and meat is browned; add herbs; place in cabbage halves. Mix butter with breadcrumbs; place on top of cabbage; drizzle remaining 1 tbsp oil on top. Bake until tender, about 35 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Serve hot.

In a saucepan bring sugar and water to a boil, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Let syrup cool. Stir in grapefruit juice and Campari and freeze in a shallow metal pan, stirring and crushing lumps with a fork every 30 minutes, 3 to 4 hours, or until mixture is firm but not frozen. Scrape granita with a fork to lighten texture. Serve granita in chilled goblets and garnish with zest.

Make almond meringue disks: Preheat oven to 250°F. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper. Using 3 1/4-inch-diameter can as template, outline 8 circles on each sheet of parchment. Turn parchment over on baking sheet (circles should show through).
Using electic mixer, beat whites in medium bowl until soft peaks form. Scrape seeds from vanilla bean. Gradually add sugar, beating until meringue is stiff and glossy, about 5 minutes. Fold in ground almonds. Spread 1 rounded tablespoon of meringue in each circle on parchment, forming disks about 1/4 inch thick.
Bake meringue disks 1 hour. Reverse position of sheets and bake until meringues are pale golden and almost firm to touch, about 45 minutes longer. Cool meringues on baking sheets. Carefully peel meringues off parchment.
Arrange 8 meringues on clean baking sheet; top each with second meringue. Top each stack with scoop of sorbet (don't press; disks are fragile). Cover with foil; freeze while making vanilla meringue or up to 2 days.

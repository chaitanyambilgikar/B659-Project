1. Bring 1/2 inch of water to boil in a medium skillet. Add the spinach leaves and stir until wilted, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain in a colander. Rinse with cold running water until cool. Squeeze the spinach in batches by hand or through a fine-mesh sieve to remove as much liquid as possible.
2. Melt the butter in the same pan over medium heat, add the flour, and stir for 1 minute. Whisk in the milk and bring to a boil.
3.Transfer the spinach mixture to a food processor. Puree until smooth and then let cool before serving.

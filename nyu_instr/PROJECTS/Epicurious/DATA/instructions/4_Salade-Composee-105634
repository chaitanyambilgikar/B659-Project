Marinate kidney beans, zucchini, and mushrooms in vinaigrette for 20 to 30 minutes.
At serving time, toss mixed salad greens in a bowl with vinaigrette and arrange around the edges of a large serving dish. Mound the beans in the center, and decorate base with groups of marinated mushrooms and zucchini interspersed with hard-boiled eggs, tomatoes, olives, anchovies, chunks of tuna or other fish.
Pour a bit more vinaigrette over all, sprinkle with chopped parsley or other herbs, and serve with French bread and a chilled rosé wine.

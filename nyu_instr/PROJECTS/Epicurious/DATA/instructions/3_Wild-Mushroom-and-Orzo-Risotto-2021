Rinse mushrooms briefly with cold water. Place in small bowl. Add 1 1/2 cups hot water and let soak until softened, about 30 minutes. Drain mushrooms, reserving soaking liquid. Squeeze mushrooms and chop.
Heat oil in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and sauté until tender, about 8 minutes. Add orzo and stir until coated with oil. Mix in chopped mushrooms.
Meanwhile combine 4 cups broth other medium saucepan. Bring to simmer. Reduce heat to low and keep hot.
Add 1 cup liquid to orzo, adjust heat so liquid simmers slowly and cook until orzo absorbs liquid, stirring occasionally. Continue adding liquid 1 cup at a time, simmering until each addition is absorbed before adding next and stirring occasionally until orzo is just tender and liquid is creamy, about 30 minutes. Stir in Parmesan. Season with salt and pepper. Garnish with parsley.

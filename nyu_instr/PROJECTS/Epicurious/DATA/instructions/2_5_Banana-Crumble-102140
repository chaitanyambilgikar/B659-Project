Preheat the oven to 400°F. Have children grease a 9- by 13-inch baking dish.
Let the kids help you slice the bananas in half lengthwise with a table knife. Place the bananas cut side down in the prepared baking dish.
Have the children place the dry ingredients in a medium mixing bowl. Using a table knife, have the kids help you cut up the cold butter into little pieces and add them to the bowl. With clean hands, have the children work the butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture is crumbly. Then spread the crumble mixture over the bananas in an even layer, pressing down slightly.
Place the dish in the oven and bake until the crumble gets firm but not mushy and has turned golden in color, 10 to 15 minutes. Serve very warm.

Heat 1/3 cup cream in a 1-quart saucepan over low heat until hot, then whisk in chocolate with a pinch of salt until smooth. Transfer to a bowl and cool to room temperature, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes.
Beat remaining cup cream with extract in another bowl using an electric mixer at medium speed until it just holds soft peaks. Add cooled chocolate mixture and beat until mousse just holds stiff peaks. Fold in 1/4 cup candy and spoon into 4 stemmed glasses, then sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup candy. Chill until cold, about 1 hour.

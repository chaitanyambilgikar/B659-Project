Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally. Drain pasta.
Meanwhile, heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add garlic and sauté until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add canned clams with juice, basil, tarragon, and parsley. Add fresh clams. Cover; reduce heat to medium and cook until clams open, about 6 minutes. Using tongs, transfer fresh clams to plate (discard any clams that do not open). Add cooked pasta and cream to sauce in skillet. Toss over medium-high heat until sauce coats pasta, about 1 minute. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Divide pasta between bowls. Top with fresh clams and serve.

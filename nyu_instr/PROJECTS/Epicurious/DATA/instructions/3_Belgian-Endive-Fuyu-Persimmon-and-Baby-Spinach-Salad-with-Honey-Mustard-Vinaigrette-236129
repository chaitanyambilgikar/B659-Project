In small bowl, whisk together stock and cornstarch. In second small bowl, whisk together soy sauce, sesame oil, vinegar, honey, mustard, and salt.
In medium saucepan over moderately high heat, heat olive oil until hot but not smoking. Add garlic and sauté until soft, about 30 seconds. Stir in stock-cornstarch mixture and bring to boil. Reduce heat to moderate and simmer until thickened, about 5 minutes. Stir in soy sauce mixture and return to boil. Remove from heat and refrigerate until cool.

1. In a food processor or by hand, mix together all the dry ingredients and then add in the vegetable oil, followed by 1/3 cup water, mixing until a smooth, satiny, firm dough is formed. Add more water if needed. Firmer dough helps to make the poori puff up better and also to absorb less oil when frying.
2. Turn the dough onto a floured work surface and knead for 5 minutes. Place in an oiled bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 30 minutes.
3. Divide the dough into 8 equal portions and roll into balls. Apply oil on opposite sides of the dough balls and flatten each with a rolling pin into a round disk 3 to 4 inches in diameter.
4. Line a sheet pan with paper towels. Fill a medium saucepan or heavy-bottom pan a third full with canola oil, about 4 inches, and set it over medium-high heat; heat to 350°F. Test the oil by dropping in a small piece of dough. The oil is ready if the dough sizzles upon contact and begins to brown within a minute. Deep-fry the bread, one at the time, until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes, turning once to ensure it puffs up. Pressing the dough down gently beneath the surface of the oil with a slotted spoon while the poori is frying helps to make it puff up. Place pooris on lined sheet pan to drain and serve immediately.

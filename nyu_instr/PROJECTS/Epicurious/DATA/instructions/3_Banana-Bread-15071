Preheat oven to 350°F.
Lightly spray a 5 x 9-inch loaf pan with non-stick cooking spray.
Combine the bananas, vanilla, egg and fructose in a large bowl and mix well. In another bowl combine the flour and baking powder and mix well.
Add the flour mixture to the banana mixture and mix lightly. Add the melted margarine and mix just until moistened.
Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.
Remove the bread from the pan and cool on a wire rack for at least 30 minutes before slicing.

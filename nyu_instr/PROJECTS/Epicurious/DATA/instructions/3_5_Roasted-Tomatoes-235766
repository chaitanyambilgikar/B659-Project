Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350°F. Oil a shallow baking pan.
Arrange tomatoes, cut sides up, in 1 layer in pan and sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Roast tomatoes until skins are wrinkled and beginning to brown on bottom, about 1 hour. Transfer to a serving dish and keep warm, covered with tented foil (do not let foil touch tomatoes), until ready to serve. Serve warm or at room temperature.

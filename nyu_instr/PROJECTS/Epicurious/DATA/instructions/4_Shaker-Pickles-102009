Mix the vegetables with the salt in a large bowl. Spread the ice over the top, cover with a weighted lid or plate and let stand for 3 hours. Drain. Mix the remaining ingredients in a large pot and bring to a boil. Add the drained vegetables and bring to a boil again. Pour into hot, sterilized jars, cover and seal.

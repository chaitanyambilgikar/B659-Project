Peel potatoes and cut into 1-inch pieces.
In a steamer set over boiling water steam potatoes, covered, until very tender, 15 to 20 minutes.
In a large heavy saucepan cook onion in 4 tablespoons butter over moderately low heat, stirring, until softened. Add anchovies and cook, mashing them, until they dissolve, about 1 minute. Stir in milk, cream, and remaining 2 tablespoons butter and heat until hot but not boiling.
Force potatoes through a ricer or food mill into pan and stir until smooth. Stir in chives and salt and pepper to taste.

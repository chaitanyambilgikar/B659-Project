Allow 2 large slices of really good pumpernickel or black Russian rye, well buttered, for each sandwich. On one slice place a slice of Switzerland Emmenthal cheese, a generous slice of baked or boiled ham, a layer of really excellent cole slaw, a generous helping of cold white meat of turkey, and Russian dressing. Top with the second slice and serve with additional cole slaw and Russian dressing if you wish.

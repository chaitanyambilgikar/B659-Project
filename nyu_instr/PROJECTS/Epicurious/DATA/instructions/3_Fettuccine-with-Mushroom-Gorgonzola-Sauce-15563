Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add onions and garlic. Sauté until onions are tender, about 8 minutes. Add mushrooms and bell peppers. Sauté until tender, about 20 minutes. (Can be prepared 8 hours ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Rewarm before continuing.)
Cook fettuccine in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite. Drain well; return pasta to pot.
Meanwhile, add 1 1/4 cups whipping cream and cheese to mushroom mixture. Simmer gently over medium heat until cheese melts, stirring occasionally, about 4 minutes. Stir in chives, parsley and basil. Add sauce to pasta; toss to coat. Season pasta to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer to bowl and serve.

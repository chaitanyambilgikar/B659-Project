Heat a dry large heavy nonreactive skillet (not nonstick) over medium heat until hot, then cook tomatoes, onion, and garlic, turning with tongs, until all are blackened in spots, 10 to 12 minutes. Purée in a blender with chiles and 3/4 teaspoon salt (use caution when blending hot foods). Return to skillet and simmer, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and cool to room temperature, then stir in cilantro.

Preheat oven to 400&;deg;F. Toss potatoes with 3 tablespoons bacon drippings and 1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds in large bowl. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Spread potatoes in single layer on heavy large baking sheet. Roast until tender, tossing occasionally, about 55 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons bacon drippings in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion, chopped fennel and 1 teaspoon fennel seeds. Sauté until vegetables are almost tender, about 7 minutes. Add bell pepper and sauté until vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes longer. Transfer vegetables to large bowl.
Add potatoes, smoked salmon and herbs to vegetable mixture; toss to combine. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer hash to platter and tent with foil to keep warm.
Add vinegar to large skillet of simmering water. Crack eggs into water. Simmer until eggs are softly cooked, about 3 minutes. Using slotted spoon, remove eggs from water, drain briefly and place atop hash.

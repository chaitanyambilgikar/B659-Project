Pat lamb chops dry and sprinkle evenly with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over high heat until it shimmers, then sear lamb, turning over once, until browned, about 5 minutes total for medium.
Meanwhile, toss together eggplant, pimientos, onion, parsley, sugar, remaining 2 tablespoons oil, and salt and pepper to taste. Serve eggplant relish over lamb.

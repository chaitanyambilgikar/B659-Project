1. Decide the color or combinations you want to use—you may use one or more colors of paint for each marbling bath.
2. For each bath, fill a roasting pan with about 4 inches of water. Put on the rubber gloves. Add about 1 teaspoon of each color paint in the chosen combination. Swirl the end of a skewer through the paint.
3. Place an egg on the end of a skewer. Swirl it around through the paint and water. When the paint has adhered to the egg in a marbled pattern, remove the egg from the skewer to an egg carton and let it dry.
4. Repeat this process for each egg, using the different color marbleizing baths as you wish.
5. To dispose of paint responsibly, pour each bath slowly through a coffee filter, letting the water drain down the sink and capturing the paint. Throw away the paint.

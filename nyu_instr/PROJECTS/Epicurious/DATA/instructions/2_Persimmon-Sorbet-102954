Bring 1 cup water and sugar to a boil, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Boil 3 minutes, then cool. Core, quarter, and, if necessary, seed persimmons. Scrape pulp from skins into a blender. Purée with lemon juice until very smooth. Add sugar syrup and blend. Chill until very cold, at least 2 hours.
Freeze mixture in an ice-cream maker. (Alternatively, transfer to a shallow metal baking pan and freeze, stirring every 30 minutes, until slushy, about 2 hours.) Transfer to an airtight container and freeze. (Sorbet's consistency will remain soft.)

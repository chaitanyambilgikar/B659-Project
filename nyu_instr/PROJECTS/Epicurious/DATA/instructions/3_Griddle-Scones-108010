Sift together flour, baking soda, cream of tartar, and salt into a bowl. Stir together buttermilk and butter in a small bowl with a fork, then add to dry ingredients and stir just until a soft dough forms.
Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface. Divide dough in half and knead each half 3 or 4 times. Pat each half into a 6-inch round (1/2 inch thick), then cut each round into 4 wedges.
Heat griddle over low heat until hot. Working in 2 batches if griddle is small, lightly dust both sides of each scone with flour, shaking off excess, and cook scones over low heat, undisturbed, 3 minutes. Increase heat to moderately low and cook until scones are puffed and undersides are golden brown, about 5 minutes more. Turn scones over and cook until golden brown and cooked through (watch scones closely and adjust heat as needed so they cook through but do not burn), 7 to 8 minutes (cut one scone open to check for doneness).
Transfer to a rack and cool to warm, 3 to 4 minutes.

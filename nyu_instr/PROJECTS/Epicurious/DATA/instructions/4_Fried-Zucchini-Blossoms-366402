In a large pot, heat about 2" oil over medium heat until a deep-fry thermometer reads 350°. Combine flour and salt in a medium bowl, then whisk in beer until almost smooth (some small lumps are welcome—don't overwhisk or you'll deflate the batter). One by one, dredge the blossoms in batter, shaking off the excess; gently lay them in the oil, without crowding the pan. Cook, flipping once with a slotted spoon, until golden brown, 2–3 minutes total. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Sprinkle with sea salt and devour while hot.
Variation #1: For an even lighter, crispier crust, fold 3 stiffly beaten egg whites into batter and proceed as above.
Variataion #2: Stuffed blossoms are a favorite in Italy. To fill about 16, combine 1 cup ricotta, 1 tablespoon freshly chopped mint, and 1/2 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest in a bowl. Season with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Using a spoon, fill each blossom with about 1 tablespoon ricotta mixture, then dip in batter and fry as above.

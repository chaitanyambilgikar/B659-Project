Combine cranberry juice concentrate and sugar in heavy medium saucepan. Stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat and bring to boil. Mix in remaining ingredients. Simmer until pears are tender and cranberries burst, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes. Remove from heat. Cool completely. Chill thoroughly. (Can be prepared 3 days ahead. Cover and keep refrigerated.)

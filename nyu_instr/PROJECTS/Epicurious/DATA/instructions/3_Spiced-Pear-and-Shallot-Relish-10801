In a saucepan bring wine, water, sugar, and lemon juice to a boil, stirring to dissolve sugar. Tie spices in a cheesecloth bag and add to wine syrup. Simmer syrup 5 minutes.
Peel and core pears and cut in 1/4-inch dice. Poach pears in syrup at a bare simmer, uncovered, stirring once or twice, 5 minutes and discard spice bag. Remove pan from heat and stir in shallots. Relish may be made 1 week ahead and chilled, covered.
Serve relish chilled or at room temperature with poultry or pork.

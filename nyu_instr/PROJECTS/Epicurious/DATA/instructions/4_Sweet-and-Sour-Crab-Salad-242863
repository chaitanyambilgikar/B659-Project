Make dressing: Bring vinegar and sugar to a boil in a small nonreactive saucepan, stirring until sugar has dissolved. Remove from heat and stir in garlic, red-pepper flakes, and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Cool to room temperature
Make salad while dressing cools: Using slicer, cut cucumber lengthwise into long julienne strips, slicing until you reach core, then rotate cucumber a quarter turn and continue slicing and rotating until left with nothing but core. Discard core and pat cucumber strips dry.
Cut through crab shells with kitchen shears. Remove and coarsely shred meat.
Toss crabmeat with cucumber, remaining ingredients, dressing, and salt to taste.

Cut apples into 1/2 inch chunks (do not peel) and in a heavy saucepan cook with garlic, sugar, and water, covered, over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, 20 minutes, or until apples are translucent and tender. Remove lid and cook mixture, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes more, or until almost all liquid is evaporated.
Force apple mixture through a course sieve or food mill fitted with fine disk into a bowl, discarding solids, and stir in horseradish. Applesauce may be made 4 days ahead and chilled, covered.
Serve applesauce chilled or at room temperature with poultry or pork.

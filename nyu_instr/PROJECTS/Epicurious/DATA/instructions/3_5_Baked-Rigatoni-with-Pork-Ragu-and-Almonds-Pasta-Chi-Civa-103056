Work tomatoes with juice through food mill set over a large bowl, scraping pulp from underside into bowl. Discard seeds and other solids remaining in mill.
Preheat oven to 400°F.
Cook onion in 3 tablespoons oil in a 3-quart heavy saucepan over moderately low heat, stirring, until softened. Add pork and sauté over moderately high heat, stirring and breaking up lumps, until lightly browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir together tomato paste and water and stir into pork. Simmer until most of tomato paste is absorbed, about 2 minutes, then add tomatoes, sugar, cinnamon, pepper, and 1 tablespoon sea salt. Simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until reduced to about 4 cups, about 30 minutes.
While pork ragù simmers, bring 6 quarts water to a boil with 2 tablespoons oil and remaining 2 tablespoons sea salt in an 8-quart pot for rigatoni. Toast almonds in a shallow baking pan in middle of oven until fragrant and a few shades darker, 8 to 10 minutes. Immediately sprinkle nuts with extract, tossing. Cool and coarsely chop.
Reduce oven temperature to 375°F.
Stir together bread crumbs and remaining tablespoon oil in a small heavy skillet and cook over low heat, stirring, until deep golden, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer to a small bowl.
Cook rigatoni in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until just al dente, then drain. Toss pasta with about 1/2 cup of liquid from ragÃ¹ in a large bowl. Spread a thin coating of ragâ€¹ in bottom of a lightly oiled 13- by 9- by 2-inch baking dish, then spread half of rigatoni over it. Top with half of almonds, half of remaining ragÃ¹, half of bread crumbs, and half of cheese. Repeat layers with remaining ingredients and bake until edges are lightly browned, about 20 minutes.

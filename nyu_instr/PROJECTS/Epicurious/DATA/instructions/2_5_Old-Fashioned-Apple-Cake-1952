Preheat oven to 375°F. Butter 9-inch-diameter springform pan with 2 3/4-inch-high sides. Sift first 5 ingredients into large bowl. Rub in butter until mixture resembles coarse meal. Mix in apples and brown sugar. Whisk eggs and milk together; stir into apple mixture (batter will be thick). Transfer to pan. Sprinkle with sugar.
Bake cake until golden and springy to touch, about 35 minutes. Cool slightly on rack. Cut around cake to loosen; remove pan sides. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cool. Wrap tightly; store at room temperature.) Place doily atop cake. Sprinkle powdered sugar over; remove doily.

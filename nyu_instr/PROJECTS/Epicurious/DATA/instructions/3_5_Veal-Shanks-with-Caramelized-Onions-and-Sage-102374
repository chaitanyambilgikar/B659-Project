Sprinkle veal with salt and pepper. Combine flour and dried sage in shallow bowl. Set 3 tablespoons flour mixture aside. Dredge veal in remaining flour mixture to coat; shake off excess. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large very wide pot over medium-high heat. Working in batches, cook veal until brown, about 7 minutes per side. Transfer veal to bowl.
Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in same pot. Add onions and sauté until beginning to brown, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and sauté onions until very deep brown, about 35 minutes longer. Add garlic and sauté 5 minutes. Add whole sage leaves and reserved 3 tablespoons flour mixture; stir 2 minutes. Add wine; bring to boil.
Arrange veal in single layer in pot. Add broth. Cover and simmer over medium-low heat until meat is very tender but does not fall off bone, about 1 hour 45 minutes. Uncover; simmer until juices thicken enough to coat spoon, about 30 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
Place 1 veal shank on each plate. Spoon sauce and onion mixture over. Sprinkle with additional fresh sage.

Combine 2 cups hot water and ancho chilies in medium bowl. Let stand until chilies soften, about 30 minutes. Drain, reserving soaking liquid.
Meanwhile, char poblano chilies directly over gas flame or in broiler until blackened on all sides. Enclose in paper bag; let stand 10 minutes. Peel, seed, and coarsely chop chilies.
Place drained ancho chilies, 1/2 cup reserved soaking liquid, chopped poblano chilies, cream, honey, and vinegar in blender. Puree until smooth, adding more soaking liquid by tablespoonfuls if sauce is too thick. Season to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Rewarm before serving.) Place sauce in small bowl.

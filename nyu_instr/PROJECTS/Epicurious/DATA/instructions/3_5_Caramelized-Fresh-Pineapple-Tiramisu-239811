For cognac sabayon: Whisk yolks, cream, 4 tablespoons sugar, and salt in medium metal bowl to blend. Set bowl over saucepan of simmering water and whisk until mixture is thick and thermometer registers 160°F, about 5 minutes. Remove from over water. Place over larger bowl of ice and water. Cool quickly, whisking often, about 5 minutes.
Stir mascarpone in large bowl to loosen texture. Fold in cooled yolk mixture in 3 additions, then fold in Cognac. Beat whites in medium bowl until soft peaks form. Add 2 tablespoons sugar and beat until stiff but not dry; fold into sabayon in 3 additions. Cover; chill up to 1 day.
For caramelized pineapple: Combine pineapple, sugar, and salt in large nonstick skillet. Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add bean. Stir over medium heat until sugar melts and syrup forms. Continue cooking until syrup is absorbed and pineapple is dry and golden, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes; cool completely.

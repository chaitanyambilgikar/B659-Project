Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Turn the hazelnuts out onto a baking sheet and toast in the preheated oven for about 5-7 minutes, until pale golden. Remove the nuts from the oven and cool slightly. Put the warm hazelnuts into a food processor and chop until they become an almost smooth paste.
Gently melt the chocolate, condensed milk, and hazelnut oil in a small saucepan over low heat. Stir until smooth and add to the hazelnut paste in the food processor. Add a pinch of salt and blend, then add the hot water and blend again until the mixture has a thick, spreadable consistency.
Spoon into a pretty sterilized jar and let cool. Cover with a lid and label when cold.

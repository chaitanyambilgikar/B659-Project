Pat chicken dry and season with salt and pepper. In a 12-inch nonstick skillet heat oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and sauté chicken, skin or skinned sides down, 3 minutes, or until golden. Turn chicken over and sauté 1 minute more. Reduce heat to moderately low and cook chicken, covered, until just cooked through, about 10 minutes. Coarsely chop capers and in a large bowl toss chicken with any juices from skillet, capers, and vinaigrette. Serve chicken warm or at room temperature.

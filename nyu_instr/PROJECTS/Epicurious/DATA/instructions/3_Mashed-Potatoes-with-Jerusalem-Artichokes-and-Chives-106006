Fill large pot half full with cold water; add lemon juice. Peel artichokes, cut into 1-inch pieces and add to pot. Bring to boil. Cover and boil until artichokes are almost tender, about 20 minutes. Drain.
Return artichokes to pot. Add potatoes, salt, and enough water to cover vegetables; bring to boil. Cover and boil until potatoes and artichokes are very tender, about 25 minutes. Drain. Return vegetables to pot; set over low heat. Add crème fraîche and butter. Mash until mixture is almost smooth. Season to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be made 2 hours ahead. Rewarm over medium-low heat, stirring frequently.) Stir in chives. Transfer to bowl and serve.

1. Remove any tough veinsfrom the centerof the lettuce leaves and discard; set lettuce aside. Slice the carrots, scallions and red bell pepper into 4-inch "matchsticks."
2. Dip a rice paper into a bowl of water for 5 seconds; shake off excess water and place on a clean kitchen towel. Stack several lettuce leaves on the lower third of the rice paper. Top with a few carrot, scallion and bell-pepper matchsticks followed by 2 mint leaves and 2 cilantro sprigs.
3. Fold the bottom of the rice paper up over the veggies. Fold in the sides, then roll up. Repeat with remaining ingredients. Serve the rolls on a platter with Spiced Chili Sauce. (If you prefer to prepare the rolls in advance, cover them with a damp kitchen towel for up to 3 hours.)

Whisk olive oil, orange juice, white wine vinegar and minced shallot in small bowl to blend. Season to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Bring to room temperature before using.)
Combine watercress and onion in large bowl. Toss with enough dressing to coat. Transfer to platter. Arrange tangerine slices over. Sprinkle with blue cheese. Serve, passing remaining dressing separately.

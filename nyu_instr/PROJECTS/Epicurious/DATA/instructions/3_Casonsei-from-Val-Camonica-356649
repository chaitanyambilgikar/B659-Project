Make the pasta dough. Sift the flour into a mound on a counter and make a well in the center. Break the eggs into the well and add the oil and a pinch of salt. Knead to a soft dough, shape into a ball, cover with a clean dish towel, and let rest for 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, make the filling. Cook the potatoes in lightly salted boiling water for 15-20 minutes until tender. Drain and mash. Cook the chard leaves in just enough boiling water to cover for 5-10 minutes until tender. Drain, squeeze out the excess liquid, and chop. Melt the butter in a pan. Add the garlic and parsley and cook over low heat, stirring frequently for a few minutes. Add the leek and sausage and cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and let cool. Combine the sausage mixture, mashed potatoes, chard, bread crumbs, Parmesan, and egg in a bowl and season to taste with salt and pepper.
Roll out the dough on a lightly floured counter into a thin sheet. Cut out rectangles about 3 1/4 x 6 1/4 inches. Put a mound of filling on each one, roll the dough up, and press the edges well to seal, then gently bend into a horseshoe shape. Cook the casônsèi in plenty of salted boiling water for 5 minutes until al dente. Drain, transfer to a warmed serving dish, pour the melted butter over them, and sprinkle with Parmesan. Serve immediately.

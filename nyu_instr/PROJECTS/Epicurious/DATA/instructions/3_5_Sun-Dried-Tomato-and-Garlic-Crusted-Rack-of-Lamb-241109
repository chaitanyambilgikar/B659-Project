Tomato and garlic crust: Preheat oven to 350°F. Place 1/4 cup reserved tomato oil, garlic, and shallots in small baking dish; sprinkle with salt and pepper and cover with foil. Bake until garlic is tender, about 45 minutes.
Transfer garlic mixture to processor. Add tomatoes and oregano. Blend until paste forms. Season with salt and pepper. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 days ahead. Transfer to bowl, cover, and chill.
Lamb: Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add garlic and rosemary to skillet. Saute until garlic browns, about 5 minutes. Discard garlic and rosemary. Sprinkle lamb on all sides with salt and pepper. Add 1 rack to skillet, rounded side down. Sear until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Transfer rack to large rimmed baking sheet, rounded side up. Repeat with remaining lamb rack.
Preheat oven to 450°F. Roast lamb 18 minutes. Remove from oven. Spread 1/3 cup tomato-garlic paste thinly all over top of each. Return to oven and roast until thermometer inserted into center registers 134°F, about 3 minutes longer. Let lamb rest 10 minutes. Cut between bones into individual chops and serve.
WHAT TO DRINK: Black cherry fruit and a slightly spicy finish are a nice match for the garlicky lamb. Try Alpha Estate 2005 Xiñómavro (Greece, $36).

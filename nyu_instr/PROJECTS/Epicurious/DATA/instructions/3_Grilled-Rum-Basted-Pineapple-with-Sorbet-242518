Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Place pineapple on grill; cook until just heated through, about 1 minute per side. Brush generously with rum; grill 1 minute longer on each side. Transfer to plates; brush with rum. Top each pineapple round with small scoops of sorbet; garnish with mint. Serve with cookies.

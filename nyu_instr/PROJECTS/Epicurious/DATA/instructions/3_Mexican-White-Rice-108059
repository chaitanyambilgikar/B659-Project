Heat oil in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic; sauté until deep brown, about 3 minutes. Discard garlic. Add onion to saucepan and sauté until tender, about 5 minutes. Add rice; stir 5 minutes. Add 3 cups hot water, parsley, and salt (mixture will sputter). Bring to boil, stirring. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until almost all liquid is absorbed, about 15 minutes. Stir rice, then re-cover and continue to simmer until all liquid is absorbed and rice is tender, about 5 minutes longer. Remove from heat; let stand, covered, 10 minutes. Discard parsley; fluff rice with fork.

Toast and skin hazelnuts. In a food processor pulse nuts with 1 teaspoon sugar until finely ground. Add flour, baking powder, and a pinch salt, pulsing to combine. Add remaining 1/3 cup sugar and pulse to combine. Cut butter into small pieces and add to flour mixture, pulsing until mixture resembles coarse meal. In a small bowl lightly beat together egg, Frangelico or hazelnut extract, and vanilla. Add egg mixture to butter mixture, pulsing until mixture forms a dough. Dough may be kept, wrapped in plastic wrap and chilled, up to 3 days. Bring dough to room temperature before using.

Ingredient tips: Chili bean paste is a spicy, fermented soybean paste. Star anise—a star-shaped seedpod—is available at some supermarkets. Chinese yellow rock sugar is made from raw sugar; it is often used in Chinese sauces and teas. Despite their name, Sichuan peppercorns aren't related to regular peppercorns; the mildly hot dried berries, which resemble split peppercorns, come from the prickly ash tree. Shandong la mian are Chinese wheat noodles. Look for these ingredients at specialty foods stores and Asian markets.

Line large baking sheet with foil. Stir chocolate in small bowl set over saucepan of simmering water until melted, smooth, and warm. Remove bowl from over water. Mix orange peel into chocolate, if desired. Spoon by teaspoonfuls onto foil, spacing about 1 1/2 inches apart (do not spread). Top with berries and toffee, making sure toppings touch melted chocolate. Chill until chocolate sets, about 15 minutes. Remove from foil.

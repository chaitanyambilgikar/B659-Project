Whisk oil, vinegar, shallot, salt and pepper in a bowl. Set aside. Cook asparagus in simmering water until soft but still crisp, 3 to 4 minutes. Rinse under cold water and drain. Wrap a strip of ham around each asparagus stalk. Toss frisée, greens and grapes with dressing in a bowl, then transfer to a platter; top with asparagus. Garnish with almonds.

1. Sprinkle both sides of steaks liberally with salt and pepper. Set aside.
2. Fill a charcoal chimney with briquets, set the chimney on the bottom grill grate, and light. When the coals are ready, dump them into the bottom of your grill. Cover half of your bottom grate with briquets.
3. When the briquets are white-hot, place each steak directly onto the hot coals using long-handled tongs or a fork. Leave steaks on the coals for 2 minutes. Turn them over and grill for another 2 to 3 minutes for rare (125°F on a meat thermometer). For medium-rare (135°F) to medium (140°F), leave the steaks on the coals for 1 to 2 minutes longer. Remove the steaks from the coals and brush off the ashes. Spread melted butter over the top and a squeeze of lemon before serving, if you desire.

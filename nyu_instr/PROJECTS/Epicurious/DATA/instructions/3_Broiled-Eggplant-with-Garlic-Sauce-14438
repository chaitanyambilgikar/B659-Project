Score cut sides of eggplant in a cross-hatch pattern and sprinkle with salt. Let eggplant stand 30 minutes. Rinse eggplant and pat dry.
Preheat broiler.
In a small bowl whisk together garlic, soy sauce, vinegar, and sesame oil.
Arrange eggplant, cut sides down, on oiled baking sheets and brush skins lightly with vegetable oil. Broil eggplant 3 to 4 inches from heat until skins are softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn eggplant and brush lightly with more vegetable oil. Broil eggplant 3 to 4 minutes, or until flesh is golden. Transfer eggplant with a slotted spatula to a platter and brush with garlic sauce.

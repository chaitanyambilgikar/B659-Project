Place the ginger, shallots, and orange zest in the work bowl of a food processor fitted with the metal blade and process until fine, about 10 seconds. Transfer the mixture to the insert of the slow cooker. Add the carrots, potatoes, broth, and orange juice. Cover and cook on high for 2 hours, or until the vegetables are very soft.
Use a hand-held immersion blender to purée the soup right in the insert. (Alternatively, thesoup can be puréed in batches in a food processor fitted with the metal blade or in a blender.) Taste the soup, then season with the Tabasco and soy sauce. Serve the soup hot or cold, garnished with a dollop of plain yogurt or sour cream.

For sauce: Combine wine, shallots and ginger in heavy small saucepan over high heat. Boil until liquid is reduced to 1/4 cup, about 5 minutes. Add cream and boil until liquid is reduced by half, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat.
For fish: Mix soy sauce, honey and rice vinegar in another heavy small saucepan. Mix water and cornstarch in small bowl until smooth. Add to soy sauce mixture. Stir mixture over medium heat until glaze boils and thickens slightly, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Cool glaze to room temperature. (Sauce and glaze can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover separately and refrigerate.)
Preheat oven to 350°F. Arrange fish on small baking sheet. Brush with some of glaze. Bake until opaque in center, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven. Bring remaining glaze to boil. Spoon glaze over fish.
Meanwhile, bring sauce to simmer. Remove from heat. Gradually add butter to sauce, whisking just until melted. Strain. Season with salt and pepper.
Spoon sauce onto 4 plates, dividing equally. Top with fish and serve.

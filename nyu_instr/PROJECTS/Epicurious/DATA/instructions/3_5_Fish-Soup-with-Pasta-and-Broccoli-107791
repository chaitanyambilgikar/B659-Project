Bring broth and water to a simmer with fish and garlic in a 4-quart heavy pot. Add pasta and simmer until al dente, about 5 minutes (fish will break apart). Add broccoli and simmer (still uncovered) until pasta and broccoli are tender, 2 to 3 minutes.
Add lemon juice and season soup with salt and pepper. Serve soup drizzled with oil.

Preheat oven to 400°F. Lay pie crust in center of baking sheet. Fold in 1/2-inch of crust edge. Stand up double edge and crimp decoratively, forming upright rim. Blend cheese and pesto in small bowl. Spread cheese mixture over crust. Sprinkle with pine nuts. Bake pizza until crust is set and golden, about 18 minutes.
Arrange salmon pieces over pizza. Garnish with basil and serve.

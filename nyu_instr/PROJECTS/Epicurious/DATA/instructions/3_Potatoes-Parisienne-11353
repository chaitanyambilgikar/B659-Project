Clarify butter: In a heavy saucepan melt the butter over low heat. Remove the pan from the heat, let the butter stand for 3 minutes, and skim the froth. Strain the butter through a sieve lined with a double thickness of rinsed and squeezed cheesecloth into a bowl, leaving the milky solids in the bottom of the pan. Pour the clarified butter into a jar or crock and store it, covered, in the refrigerator. The butter keeps, covered and chilled, indefinitely. When clarified, butter loses about one fourth of its original volume.
Make the potatoes: Scoop out balls from the potatoes with a small melon-ball cutter and dry them well. In a heavy skillet heat the butter over moderately high heat until it is hot but not smoking and in it sauté the potatoes, shaking the skillet, until they are golden brown. Sprinkle the potatoes with salt and pepper to taste, reduce the heat to moderately low, and cook the potatoes, covered, shaking the skillet occasionally, for 12 to 15 minutes, or until they are tender.

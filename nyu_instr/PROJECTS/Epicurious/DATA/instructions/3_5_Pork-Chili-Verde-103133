Char Anaheim chilies over gas flame or in broiler until blackened on all sides. Enclose in plastic bag 10 minutes. Peel, seed and chop chilies.
Stir cumin seeds in heavy small skillet over medium-low heat until fragrant, about 4 minutes. Transfer to spice grinder; process until finely ground. Set aside.
Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add onion; sauté 3 minutes. Add pork; cook until juices evaporate and meat browns, stirring often, about 20 minutes. Add chilies, cumin and garlic. Sauté 5 minutes. Add 4 cups water. Simmer uncovered over medium-low heat until meat is very tender and sauce just coats meat, about 1 hour. If necessary, increase heat and continue to simmer until sauce is reduced and just coats meat. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover; chill. Rewarm over medium heat, adding 1/2 cup water to loosen mixture if necessary.)

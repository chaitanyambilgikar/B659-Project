Poach pears In large saucepan over moderately high heat, stir together 4 cups water, orange juice, sugar, lemon zest, and lemon juice. Bring to simmer, stirring until sugar dissolves, then add pears, cut sides up, in single layer. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, until pears are tender but not falling apart, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and cool pears in poaching liquid. (Pears can be poached ahead and refrigerated in poaching liquid, covered, up to 24 hours. Bring to room temperature before proceeding.)
Remove pears from poaching liquid (reserve liquid) and slice lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick wedges.
Strain liquid through fine-mesh sieve into small saucepan. Set over moderate heat and simmer, uncovered, until syrupy and reduced by half, about 10 minutes. Set aside.
Make batter In large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. In medium bowl, whisk together beer and egg. Whisk wet ingredients into dry.
Fry fritters In heavy 6-quart pot over moderately high heat, heat 4 inches of oil until thermometer registers 350°F. Working in batches of 6 and returning oil to 350°F between batches, dip pear wedges into batter, transfer to hot oil, and fry until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Transfer to paper towels to drain.
Transfer pears to platter, drizzle with syrup, and dust with confectioners' sugar. Serve immediately.

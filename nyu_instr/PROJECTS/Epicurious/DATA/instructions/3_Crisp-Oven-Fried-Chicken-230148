Preheat oven to 375°F. In a shallow bowl, combine breadcrumbs, cheese, zest, paprika, and salt. In another shallow bowl, mix lemon juice and 1 tbsp water. Coat a baking pan with cooking spray. Dip chicken in liquid mixture, then in breadcrumb mixture, coating entire breast, and lay on the baking pan. Repeat with remaining breasts. Drizzle chicken with oil. Bake 20 to 25 minutes or until chicken is cooked through (no longer pink inside).

Whisk fresh lime juice, 2 tablespoons olive oil, 2 tablespoons sugar, chopped fresh cilantro, and minced serrano chilies in small bowl until sugar fully dissolves. Let sauce stand 1 hour at room temperature to allow flavors to blend together. Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper. (Chili-lime sauce can be made 8 hours ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Bring sauce to room temperature before using.)
Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Alternate halibut pieces, bell pepper pieces and onion pieces on six 10- to 12-inch metal skewers. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Drizzle kebabs with remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. Grill until fish is opaque in center and singed in places, turning kebabs occasionally, about 6 minutes. Transfer kebabs to platter. Serve kebabs, passing chili-lime sauce separately.

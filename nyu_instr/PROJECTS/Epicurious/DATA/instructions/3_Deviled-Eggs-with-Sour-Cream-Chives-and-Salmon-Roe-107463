Carefully scoop yolks from egg halves into large bowl. Finely chop 4 egg-white halves; add to bowl with yolks. Add sour cream and next 6 ingredients to yolks. Mash with fork until smooth. Arrange egg-white halves on large platter. Spoon filling into each, mounding slightly. (Can be prepared 2 hours ahead. Cover and refrigerate.) Garnish each egg half with 1/4 teaspoon roe and serve.

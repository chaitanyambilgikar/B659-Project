Preheat oven to 375°F. and have ready a rolling pin.
In a saucepan melt butter with brown sugar and corn syrup over moderate heat, stirring occasionally until sugar is dissolved. Remove pan from heat and stir in flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and a pinch salt until smooth.
Drop 6 rounded 1/2-teaspoons batter about 3 inches apart onto an ungreased baking sheet. Bake cookies in middle of oven 6 minutes, or until golden.
Remove 1 cookie from baking sheet with a thin metal spatula and immediately drape over a rolling pin to create a curved shape. Cool cookie completely on rolling pin and transfer to an airtight container. Make more cookies with remaining batter and form into tuiles in same manner. (If cookies become too brittle to drape over rolling pin, return baking sheet to oven a few seconds to allow cookies to soften.) Tuiles keep 5 days in an airtight container at cool room temperature.

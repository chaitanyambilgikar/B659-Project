To make the wafers: Preheat oven to 400°F. Generously butter heavy large cookie sheets. Beat 1/4 cup butter and sugar in medium bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in egg whites. Gradually mix in flour and salt (batter will be soft.) Drop batter by level teaspoonfuls onto prepared cookie sheets, spacing 3 inches apart. Bake until edges are golden brown and centers of cookies are still pale, about 7 minutes. Transfer cookies to racks and cool completely. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Store in airtight container.)
To make the vanilla sugar: Process sugar and vanilla bean in processor until vanilla bean is very finely minced. Strain sugar to remove any large pieces of vanilla bean. Store sugar in airtight container. Makes 2 cups.

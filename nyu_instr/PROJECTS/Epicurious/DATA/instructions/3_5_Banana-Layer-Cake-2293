Preheat oven to 350°F. Lightly butter two 9-inch-diameter cake pans with 1 1/2-inch-high sides; dust pans with flour. Combine 1 1/2 cups sugar, mashed bananas, oil, eggs, buttermilk and vanilla in large bowl. Using electric mixer, beat until mixture is well blended. Sift flour, baking soda and salt into banana mixture; beat until well blended. Divide batter equally between prepared pans.
Bake cakes until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Cool cakes in pans on racks 10 minutes. Cut around cakes to loosen; turn cakes out onto racks and cool completely.
Beat cream cheese and butter in large bowl until smooth. Add powdered sugar and blend well.
Place 1 cake layer on platter. Spread 2/3 cups frosting over. Top with second cake layer. Spread remaining frosting over sides and top of cake. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.) Garnish top of cake with banana slices, if desired, and serve.

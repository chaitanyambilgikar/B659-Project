Trim fennel stalks flush with bulbs and discard any tough outer layers. Cut bulbs lengthwise into 1/8-inch-thick slices and, if desired, halve slices lengthwise. Transfer fennel to a bowl of ice and cold water. Chill fennel at least 30 minutes, or until crisp, and up to 3 hours.
Preheat oven to 450°F.
While fennel is chilling, make dip: Quarter bell pepper lengthwise and discard stems, seeds,and ribs. In a shallow baking pan arrange quarters skin side up. Separate garlic cloves, leaving skins intact, and wrap together in foil. Add garlic package to pan with bell pepper and bake in upper third of oven 20 minutes. When cool enough to handle, peel pepper and transfer to a blender. Remove garlic from foil and squeeze pulp into blender.
In a small heavy skillet dry-roast cumin and caraway seeds over moderate heat, stirring, until fragrant and a few shades darker, about 1 minute, being careful not to burn them. In a cleaned electric coffee/spice grinder grind seeds to a powder and add to pepper mixture with remaining dip ingredients. Purée mixture until smooth. Dip may be made 5 days ahead and chilled, covered.
Drain fennel in a colander and pat dry.
Serve dip with fennel.

1.Preheat the oven to 350°F.
2.Cut the cornbread into 1-inch cubes. (You should have about 12 cups.) Place the cubes in a large bowl and toss with 2 tablespoons olive oil and the thyme. Season with salt and pepper. Spread the cubes in 1 layer on 2 baking sheets; bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until lightly toasted, shaking the pans occasionally. Cool and return to the bowl.
3.Meanwhile, cook the chorizo in 2 batches in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until browned. Using a slotted spoon, remove the chorizo and add to the bowl of cornbread, discarding any fat.
4.Place remaining olive oil and butter in a heavy saucepan. Wilt the onions and celery over medium-low heat for 15 to 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Then stir in the apricots and cherries; cook for 5 to 10 minutes longer. Carefully fold into the cornbread along with the pecans, using a rubber spatula.
5.Slowly drizzle in the broth until the stuffing is moist to your liking. Season with salt and pepper. Cool to room temperature before stuffing the turkey.

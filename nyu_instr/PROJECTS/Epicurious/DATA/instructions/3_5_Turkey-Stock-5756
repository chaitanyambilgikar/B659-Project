Pat wings, neck and giblets dry with paper towels. Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Working in batches, add turkey parts to pot and sauté until brown on all sides, about 10 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer turkey parts to large bowl.
Add onion, carrot and celery to same pot. Sauté until onion is tender, about 2 minutes. Return turkey parts to pot. Add enough cold water to cover mixture by 2 inches. Bring liquid to boil. Skim off foam. Add parsley, thyme and peppercorns. Reduce heat to medium. Simmer until liquid is reduced by half, stirring occasionally, about 2 1/2 hours.
Strain stock into large bowl. Let stand 5 minutes. Spoon fat off top of stock. (Can be prepared 5 days ahead. Cool slightly. Cover and refrigerate.)

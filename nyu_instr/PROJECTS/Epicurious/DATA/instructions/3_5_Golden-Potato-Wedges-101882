Preheat oven to 425°F and oil a large shallow baking pan large enough to hold potatoes in one layer. Peel potatoes and cut each lengthwise into 6 wedges. Toss potatoes with oil and salt and pepper to taste. Roast potatoes in lower third of oven until undersides are golden, about 40 minutes. Turn potatoes over and continue roasting until undersides are golden and potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes more.

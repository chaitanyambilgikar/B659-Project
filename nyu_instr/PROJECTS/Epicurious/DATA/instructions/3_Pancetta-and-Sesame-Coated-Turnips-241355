Wrap 1 pancetta slice around 1 turnip wedge, covering most of turnip. Repeat with remaining pancetta slices and turnip wedges.
Line rimmed baking sheet with waxed paper. Whisk egg in medium bowl to blend and place sesame seeds in another medium bowl. Dip each pancetta-wrapped turnip wedge into beaten egg to coat, then dip into sesame seeds, turning to coat generously on all sides. Place on prepared baking sheet. DO AHEAD: Turnips can be prepared 2 hours ahead. Cover and keep chilled.
Preheat oven to 350°F. Pour enough vegetable oil into heavy medium saucepan to reach depth of 2 inches. Attach deep-fry thermometer to side of pan and heat oil to 350°F. Working in batches, add sesame-coated turnip wedges to oil, and deep-fry until sesame seeds are golden, about 1 minute (turnips will be very crunchy). Transfer turnips to paper towels to drain. Arrange turnips on rimmed baking sheet and bake just until turnips are beginning to soften, about 7 minutes. Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper.

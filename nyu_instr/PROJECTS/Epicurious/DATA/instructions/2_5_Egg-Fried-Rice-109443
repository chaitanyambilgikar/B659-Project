Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a wok or 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderately high heat until just smoking. Add eggs and cook briefly, stirring once or twice, until just softly set, then transfer to a small bowl.
Heat remaining tablespoon oil in wok, then add rice, salt, and pepper and stir-fry until heated through and starting to crisp, about 3 minutes. Add scallions and peas and stir-fry 1 minute. Add egg and stir-fry just until combined.

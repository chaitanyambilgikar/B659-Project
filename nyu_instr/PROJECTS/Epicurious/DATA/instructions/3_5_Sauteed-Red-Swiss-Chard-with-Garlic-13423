Cut stems and center ribs away from Swiss chard leaves. Slice stems and center ribs thin and reserve. Chop leaves coarse and reserve separately.
In a 10- to 12-quart heavy kettle heat oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and sauté reserved stems and ribs, stirring, until crisp-tender. Add garlic and sauté, stirring, until garlic is fragrant. Add reserved leaves with water clinging to them and cook, turning with tongs, until wilted. Add 1/2 cup water and cook, covered, over moderate heat until leaves are tender, about 4 minutes. Season chard with salt and pepper. Chard may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.

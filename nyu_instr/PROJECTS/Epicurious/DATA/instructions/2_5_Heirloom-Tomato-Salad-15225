Thinly slice garlic and in a small heavy saucepan cook in oil over moderately low heat, stirring, until pale golden, about 3 minutes. Remove pan from heat and transfer oil with garlic to a glass measuring cup to cool. (Garlic will continue to brown as it cools.)
Cut tomatoes into wedges and toss together in a serving dish. Season tomatoes with salt and pepper and drizzle with garlic-oil mixture.

Peel beet, then cut into very thin slices (not paper-thin) with slicer. Cut slices into 1/8-inch-wide strips with a knife.
Heat 1 inch oil in a 2- to 2 1/2-quart heavy saucepan until thermometer registers 320°F. Fry beet strips in 4 batches, stirring frequently, until frizzled, about 1 1/2 minutes per batch. (Strips will brighten slightly.) Transfer beets with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain. (Beets will crisp as they cool.) Return oil to 320°F between batches.
Pulse caraway seeds in grinder until finely ground. Transfer to a small bowl, then stir together with butter and salt.
Mince together salmon and onion.
Spread a thin layer of caraway butter on 1 side of each bread slice, then top with salmon mixture (about 1 heaping tablespoon per slice) and spread evenly. Cut slices in half, then cut each half crosswise into 3 pieces. (If using crackers, cut crosswise with a large sharp knife to make a total of 24 equal pieces.) Sprinkle with chives (if using) and frizzled beets.

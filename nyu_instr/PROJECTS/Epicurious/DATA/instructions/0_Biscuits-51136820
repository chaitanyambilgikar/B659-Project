Heat oven to 425&Deg;F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. In a bowl, whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Rub butter into flour with fingertips until butter pieces are coated and about the size of peas. Stir in buttermilk and yogurt until just combined. Scrape dough onto a lightly floured surface; very gently shape it into an 8"x 6" rectangle, being careful not to overwork dough. Cut into 12 square biscuits. Transfer biscuits to baking sheet; brush tops with buttermilk. Bake until puffed and lightly golden, 15 minutes; serve.

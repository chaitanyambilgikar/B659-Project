Prepare grill for cooking.
Stir together yogurt, honey, lime juice, and mint in a small bowl and chill until ready to serve.
Thread about 4 pieces of fruit onto each skewer. When fire is medium-hot (you can hold your hand 5 inches above rack 3 to 4 seconds), grill fruit in batches on lightly oiled grill rack, turning once, until browned and slightly softened, about 5 minutes total. Serve fruit on skewers with sauce on the side.

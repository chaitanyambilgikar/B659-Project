Following package directions, prepare curried couscous. Add currants while couscous steams.
Heat olive oil in very large heavy skillet over medium heat. Add tofu in single layer and cook without stirring until just golden, about 4 minutes. Turn tofu over and cook 2 minutes longer. Transfer tofu to couscous. Add broccoli, onion, and bell pepper to skillet; cook over medium-high heat 2 minutes without stirring. Continue to cook vegetables until crisp-tender, stirring constantly, about 4 minutes. Add 1/2 cup water; increase heat to high and bring to boil, stirring to scrape up browned bits. Mix in 1/2 cup cilantro. Season vegetables to taste with salt and pepper. Mix couscous, vegetables, and cooking liquid in large serving bowl. Garnish with remaining 1/4 cup cilantro and serve.

In heavy medium skillet over moderate heat, heat oil until hot but not smoking. Add onion and sauté until soft, about 5 minutes. Add mustard seed and sherry, then bring to boil and reduce until no liquid remains, 1 to 2 minutes. Add sherry vinegar, persimmons, and 1 cup water, then bring to boil and reduce by 3/4, about 8 minutes. Add currants and continue cooking until almost no liquid remains and currants are plumped, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in salt and pepper. Transfer 1/2 relish to food processor and pulse until smooth, about 30 seconds. Return processed relish to skillet and stir to combine. Transfer to airtight container and refrigerate at least 24 hours and up to 3 days.

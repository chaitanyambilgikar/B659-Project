1. Cut potatoes into 1-inch pieces; cook in boiling salted water until very tender, about 15 minutes. Drain well and remove to a large bowl. While potatoes are hot, mash with the remaining ingredients (except marshmallows). 2. To serve, spoon the potatoes into an oven-to-table dish and dot with marshmallows, if desired. Reheat in a 350°F oven until warmed through, about 15 to 20 minutes.

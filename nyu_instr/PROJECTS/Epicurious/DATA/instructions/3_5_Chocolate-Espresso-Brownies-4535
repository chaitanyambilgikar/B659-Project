Preheat oven to 350°F. Line 13 x 9 x 2-inch metal baking pan with foil, extending foil over 2 sides of pan. Butter foil and pan sides. Dissolve 2 tablespoons espresso powder in 2 tablespoons hot water in medium saucepan. Add chocolate and butter. Stir over low heat until melted.
Combine flour, nuts and 2 tablespoons cocoa powder in small bowl. Whisk 1 1/4 cups sugar, eggs and vanilla in large bowl to blend. Whisk in chocolate mixture, then flour mixture. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake until tester inserted into center comes out with a few moist crumbs attached, about 30 minutes. Transfer to rack and cool completely. Cover brownie and freeze 30 minutes.
Using foil as aid, lift brownie from pan. Peel off foil. Cut brownie into 2 x 1 1/4-inch diamonds. Mix 1 tablespoon espresso powder with 2 tablespoons cocoa powder in small bowl. Cover half of each brownie with parchment; sift cocoa powder mixture over brownies. Cover cocoa-dusted half of each brownie; sift powdered sugar over brownies. (Can be made 2 weeks ahead. Place in airtight container and freeze.) Serve at room temperature.

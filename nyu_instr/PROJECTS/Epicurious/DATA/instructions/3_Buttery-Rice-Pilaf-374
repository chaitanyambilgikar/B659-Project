Melt margarine in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat. Mix in 1 teaspoon salt, then rice. Sauté until rice is golden, about 8 minutes. Add water. Boil until water is absorbed, about 10 minutes. Mix in butter. Cover, reduce heat to very low and cook until rice is tender, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. Transfer pilaf to bowl. Sprinkle with parsley and serve.

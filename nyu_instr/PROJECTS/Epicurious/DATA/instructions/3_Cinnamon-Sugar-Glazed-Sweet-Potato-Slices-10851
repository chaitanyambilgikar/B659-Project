Preheat oven to 425°F.
Peel potatoes and cut crosswise into 1/3-inch-thick slices. In a large bowl toss potatoes with oil to coat and spread in one layer in shallow baking pans. Bake potatoes until just tender, about 20 minutes.
In a small bowl stir together sugar and cinnamon and sprinkle evenly over potatoes. Bake potatoes until glazed and tender, about 5 minutes.

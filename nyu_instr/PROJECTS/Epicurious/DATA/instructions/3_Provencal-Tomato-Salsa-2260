Place sun-dried tomatoes in medium bowl. Pour enough boiling water over to cover tomatoes. Let stand until softened, about 15 minutes. Drain. Return sun dried tomatoes to same bowl. Add all remaining ingredients. Season salsa to taste with salt and pepper and toss to blend. (Can be prepared 4 hours ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)

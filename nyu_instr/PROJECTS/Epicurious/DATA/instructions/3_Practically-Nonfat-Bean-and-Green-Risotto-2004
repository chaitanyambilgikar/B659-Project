Bring broth and wine to boil in heavy large saucepan. Add onion, leek, rice and garlic and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer uncovered until rice is tender and mixture is thick and creamy, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes.
Mix beans, radicchio and arugula into rice and cook until vegetables wilt, about 2 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve, passing Parmesan separately if desired.

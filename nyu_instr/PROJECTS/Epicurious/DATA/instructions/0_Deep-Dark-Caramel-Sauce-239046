Combine sugar and 1/2 cup water in heavy deep medium saucepan. Stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat and bring syrup to boil, occasionally brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush. Boil without stirring until syrup turns dark amber color, swirling pan occasionally, about 13 minutes. Remove from heat and add cream (mixture will bubble up). Stir caramel until smooth. DO AHEAD Caramel sauce can be made 3 days ahead. Transfer to microwave-safe bowl. Cool. Cover and chill. Rewarm in microwave in 15-second intervals before using.

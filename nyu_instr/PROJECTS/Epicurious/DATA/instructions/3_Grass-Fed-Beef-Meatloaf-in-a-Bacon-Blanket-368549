Heat oven to 375°F with rack in middle.
Meanwhile, stir together bread crumbs and milk in a large bowl and set aside.
Cook onion, carrot, celery, and garlic in oil with 1 teaspoon salt in a heavy 12-inch skillet over medium heat, covered, stirring occasionally, until tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and cool.
Combine beef, pork, ketchup, eggs, Worcestershire sauce, smoked paprika, pepper, 1 teaspoon salt, and cooked vegetables with bread crumbs and mix with your hands until vegetables are well distributed and mixture is cohesive.
Form mixture into a 12-inch loaf, about 4 1/2 inches wide, in pan, and lay bacon slices crosswise over it.
Roast in oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center registers 160°F, 40 to 45 minutes.
If the bacon on top isn't crisp, reset oven to broil and broil the meatloaf, 4 to 5 inches from the heat, until bacon is crisp and browned, 2 to 3 minutes.
Let meatloaf rest in pan 10 minutes before transferring to a platter.

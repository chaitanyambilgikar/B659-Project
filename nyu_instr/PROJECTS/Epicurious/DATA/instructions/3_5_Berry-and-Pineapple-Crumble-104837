Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter 13x9x2-inch glass baking dish. Combine cake mix, butter, 1/4 cup sugar, oats and cinnamon in large bowl. Rub together with fingertips until mixture resembles coarse meal and holds together in large moist clumps. Mix in pecans. Mix frozen blueberries, pineapple with syrup and remaining 1/2 cup sugar in prepared dish. Cover fruit with cake-mix topping.
Bake crumble until fruit is bubbling thickly and topping is brown and crisp, about 1 hour. Let stand 15 minutes. Serve with ice cream.

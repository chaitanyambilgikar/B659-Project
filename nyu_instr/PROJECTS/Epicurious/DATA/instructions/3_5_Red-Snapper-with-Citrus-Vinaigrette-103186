Make vinaigrette: Whisk together passion-fruit purée, citrus juices, and vinegar. Add oil in a slow stream, whisking until emulsified. Stir in remaining vinaigrette ingredients and season with salt and pepper.
Make squash purée and fry fish: Steam squash in a steamer over boiling water, covered, until tender, about 10 minutes. Purée with butter in a food processor and add cayenne and salt to taste. Keep warm, covered.
Pat fish dry and make 3 diagonal slashes through skin of each fillet. Season with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over high heat until hot but not smoking, then fry 3 fillets, skin sides down, until golden, about 3 minutes. Turn and fry about 1 minute more, or until just cooked through. Transfer to a platter and fry remaining 3 fillets in same manner. Serve fish, skin sides up, on a bed of squash pur)e and drizzle with vinaigrette.

Pour boiling water over bulgur in a heatproof bowl, then cover bowl tightly with a plate and let stand 1 hour.
Drain bulgur in a sieve, pressing to remove any excess liquid, and transfer to a large bowl. Add lemon juice, oil, cumin, and 1/2 teaspoon salt and toss well. Stir in remaining ingredients. Season with salt and pepper and serve at room temperature.

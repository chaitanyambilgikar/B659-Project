Preheat oven to 375°F. Lightly grease two cookie sheets. Sift flour and salt into a large bowl. Set aside. With electric mixer, cream butter and add sugar gradually. To flour add very well beaten eggs, butter mixture, and seeds. Beat vigorously with wooden spoon to combine well. By hand, gently knead ingredients into a ball of soft dough. If the weather is warm and the dough is too soft to shape, you can refrigerate it for a couple of hours. Roll teaspoonfuls of the dough on a very lightly floured work surface, forming long thin ropes (about 5 inches). Roll the ropes in a plate of sugar. Place the ropes on prepared baking sheets, curling them into a circle and gently pressing ends together. Bake for 10-12 minutes until edges are very brown. Cool cookies on rack. They crisp when cool.
Variations; The caraway seeds are unexpected and a lovely complement to this sweet cookie. For a sweet, decadent cookie, substitute toffee candy bits for the seeds. This dough can be made into little crunchy cakes by placing scant 1/4 cup portions into well buttered and sugared muffin tins.

Preheat oven to 400°F.
In a bowl toss pork with flour and salt to coat. In a skillet heat 2 tablespoons oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and brown pork, stirring occasionally. Transfer pork to another bowl.
Add remaining tablespoon oil to skillet and cook onion and bell pepper, stirring occasionally, until they begin to brown, about 2 minutes. Add water and cook, covered, until vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes. Add pozole or pinto beans and 1/2 cup enchilada sauce and simmer 3 minutes. Return pork to skillet and heat through. Stir in coriander and remove skillet from heat.
Reserve 1/2 cup cheese. Put a tortilla on a work surface and mound one fourth pork mixture horizontally just below center of tortilla. Sprinkle pork filling with a heaping tablespoon of remaining cheese. Fold bottom edge of tortilla over filling and fold each side in over filling. Roll burrito away from you to completely enclose filling and make 3 more burritos in same manner with remaining tortillas, filling, and cheese.
Arrange burritos in a shallow baking pan and sprinkle with reserved cheese. Bake burritos until cheese melts and tortillas are crisp, about 10 minutes. While burritos are baking, in a small saucepan heat remaining enchilada sauce over moderate heat until hot.
Spoon enchilada sauce over burritos.

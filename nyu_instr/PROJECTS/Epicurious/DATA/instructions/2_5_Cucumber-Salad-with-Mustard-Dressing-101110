Cut cucumbers into 1/8-inch-thick slices and in a bowl layer slices, sprinkling each layer with salt. Chill cucumbers, covered, 2 hours.
In a colander drain cucumbers and rinse thoroughly. Drain cucumbers well and squeeze dry in handfuls. Pat cucumbers dry on towels. In a bowl stir together mustard, vinegar, and sugar and stir in cucumbers and dill.

In a large bowl whisk together the flours, the salt, the baking soda, the baking powder, and the dill seeds. In a bowl whisk together the buttermilk, 3 tablespoons of the butter, and the honey, add the mixture to the flour mixture, and stir the dough until it is just combined. Turn the dough out into a buttered 9-inch ceramic or glass pie plate and with floured hands pat it into a 7-inch round loaf. Brush the top with 1 tablespoon of the remaining butter, cut an X 1/4 inch deep across the top, and bake the bread in the middle of a preheated 375°F. oven for 1 hour, or until it is golden and sounds hollow when the bottom is tapped. Transfer the bread to a rack, brush it with the remaining 1 tablespoon butter, and let it cool on the rack for at least 4 hours before slicing.

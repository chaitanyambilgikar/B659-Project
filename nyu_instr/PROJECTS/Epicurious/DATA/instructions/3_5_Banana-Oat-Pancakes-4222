Combine oats and milk in large bowl. Let stand until oats are soft, about 15 minutes. Mix in mashed bananas, eggs, wheat germ and cinnamon. Gradually stir in pancake mix (batter will be very thick).
Preheat oven to 250°F. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in large nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Using generous 1/4 cup batter for each pancake, drop in 4 pancakes, spacing apart. Cook pancakes until brown on bottom and some bubbles begin to break around edges, about 3 minutes. Turn pancakes over. Cook until brown on bottom and firm to touch in center, about 3 minutes (pancakes will be thick). Transfer pancakes to baking sheet; place in oven to keep warm. Repeat with remaining butter and batter in 2 more batches. Serve pancakes with syrup and, if desired, berries and bananas.

Cook bacon in heavy large pot over medium heat until fat is rendered and bacon is crisp, about 5 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towels; drain. Discard all but 2 tablespoons drippings in pot. Add onions, bell pepper and garlic to pot; sauté until vegetables are tender, about 8 minutes. Stir in bacon, beans and remaining ingredients. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer uncovered until mixture thickens, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Rewarm over medium heat, stirring often, about 10 minutes.)

Preheat oven to 350°F.
Stir together flax, sesame, and poppy seeds.
Put 1 tortilla on each of 2 baking sheets and brush with some egg mixture. Sprinkle with seeds to coat, then cut each tortilla into long thin triangles with a sharp knife.
Bake in upper and lower thirds of oven, switching position of sheets halfway through baking, until crisp and lightly golden, 15 to 20 minutes total. Transfer triangles to racks to cool. Repeat with remaining 2 tortillas.

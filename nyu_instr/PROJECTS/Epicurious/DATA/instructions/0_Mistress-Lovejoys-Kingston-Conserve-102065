Grind pineapple and orange together in a meat grinder, using the coarsest blade. Place all the fruits in a large pot, add the sugar and bring to a boil, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Turn heat low, cover the pot and simmer for 1/2 hour, or until fruits and rind are tender. Uncover, turn up the heat and boil vigorously until the mixture thickens and the juices become syrupy. Remove from heat, stir in coconut and rum and pour into hot, sterilized jelly glasses. Cover with a thin layer of paraffin. When the paraffin has hardened, cover the glasses and store.

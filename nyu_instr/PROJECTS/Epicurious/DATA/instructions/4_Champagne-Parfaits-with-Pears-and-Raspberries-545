Place 1 tablespoon Champagne in small bowl. Sprinkle gelatin over; let stand until soft, about 10 minutes. Combine remaining Champagne and 1 cup sugar in heavy medium saucepan; stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat and bring to boil. Add pears; reduce heat and simmer just until pears are tender, turning pears often, about 6 minutes. Using slotted spoon, place pears on plate and cool. Boil poaching liquid until reduced to 1 1/3 cups, about 15 minutes.
Whisk egg yolks in medium bowl to blend. Gradually whisk in hot poaching liquid; return mixture to same saucepan. Stir over medium-low heat until candy thermometer registers 175°F., about 4 minutes. Remove from heat; add gelatin mixture and whisk until dissolved. Chill custard until thickened but not set, stirring occasionally, about 1 hour.
Set aside 4 raspberries for garnish. Combine remaining raspberries and 1 tablespoon sugar in medium bowl. Let stand 10 minutes. Coarsely chop pears. Beat cream until stiff peaks form. Fold cream into custard. Place 1/4 cup raspberries in each of four 12- to 16-ounce goblets or balloon-shaped wineglasses. Spoon half of pears over raspberries, dividing equally. Spoon 1/2 cup custard over each. Repeat layering with remaining raspberries, pears and custard. Cover loosely with foil; chill until custard is set, at least 6 hours or overnight.
Garnish parfaits with reserved raspberries, mint and rose petals, if desired.

For all its grandeur, a standing rib roast is actually much simpler to carve than a turkey. Just make sure that you ask the butcher to remove the chine bone, which lies along the bottom of the cut, so that you can free the ribs easily. And before you attempt either of the following methods, freshly sharpen your carving knife! Otherwise, high drama (or farce, depending on your perspective) is likely to ensue as the roast skids off the carving board.
The most straightforward method is to stand the roast on its base, ribs pointing up and toward you, and anchor it with a carving fork. Cut between each rib down to the board, cutting around any pieces of chine bone left by the butcher.
The English method is a little more elegant. Cut a thin slice off one end of the roast to make a flat surface and set the roast on that end. Sticking your fork between the ribs, slice horizontally across the top, cutting each slice free of the bone. A distinct advantage to carving a roast in this manner is that you can make the slices as thin as you want. Many people prefer two or three thin slices to a slab of meat.
Whichever carving method you choose, give yourself room to maneuver by transferring cut slices to a serving platter as you go.

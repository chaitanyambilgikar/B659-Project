Preheat oven to 375°F.
In a large saucepan simmer enchilada sauce, water, and garlic with salt to taste, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes.
Peel potatoes and cut crosswise into 1/8-inch-thick slices. In a 3-quart gratin or shallow baking dish layer one fourth of potatoes in concentric circles, overlapping slightly, and sprinkle with 1/3 cup cheese. Continue to layer remaining potatoes and cheese in same manner, ending with cheese.
Pour sauce slowly over potatoes, letting it seep between layers, and bake gratin set in a shallow baking pan (it may bubble over) in middle of oven 1 hour, or until potatoes are tender. Gratin may be made 2 days ahead and chilled, covered. Reheat gratin, covered, in oven.

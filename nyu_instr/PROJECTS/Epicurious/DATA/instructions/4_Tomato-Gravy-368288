Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add onions and thyme; cook, stirring often, until onions are soft and translucent, about 10 minutes. Add flour; stir constantly for 3 minutes. Add tomatoes with juices; cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until thickened and flavors meld, about 30 minutes. Discard thyme. Stir in scallions, cream, and 1/8 teaspoon cayenne. Season to taste with salt, pepper, and more cayenne, if desired.

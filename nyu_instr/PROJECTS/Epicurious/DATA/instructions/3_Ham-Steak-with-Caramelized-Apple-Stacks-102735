Preheat oven to 250°F.
Core whole apple (without peeling) and cut 8 (1/4-inch-thick) rounds.
Heat 1 tablespoon butter in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderately high heat, then sauté ham, turning once, until browned, 5 to 6 minutes total. Transfer ham to a heatproof dish and keep warm, loosely covered with foil, in oven. Add remaining tablespoon butter to skillet and sauté apple slices, turning once, until golden and tender, 4 minutes total. Top each piece of ham with an apple slice and continue layering, using all of ham and apple slices, to make 2 stacks. Keep warm in oven.
Add shallot to skillet and sauté over moderately high heat, stirring, until golden. Add vinegar and cook, stirring, 10 seconds, or until absorbed by shallots. Add apple juice and boil until reduced by half. Add mustards and cloves and boil until mixture is slightly thickened and syrupy. Serve stacks with sauce.

Preheat oven to 400°F. Line eight 1/3-cup muffin cups with paper liners. Blend milk and egg in small bowl. Place remaining ingredients in large bowl; add milk mixture. Stir until ingredients are just moistened (do not overmix). Divide batter among prepared muffin cups.
Bake muffins until golden and tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Serve muffins warm.

Boil sweet potatoes until tender. Peel and mash. Add egg yolks, nutmeg, salt and brown sugar. Beat mixture until it is creamy. Turn into pastry-lined 8" pie pan. Bake in hot (400°F.) oven until crust browns, 20-25 minutes. Top with meringue made by beating egg whites with powdered sugar until mixture holds its shape. Brown lightly in a slow (300°F.) oven.

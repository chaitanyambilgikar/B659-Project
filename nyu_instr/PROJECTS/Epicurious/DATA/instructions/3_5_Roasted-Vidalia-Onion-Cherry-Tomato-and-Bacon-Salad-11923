Season the onions with salt and pepper, wrap them individually in foil, and bake them in the middle of a preheated 350°F. oven for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until they are tender. Let the onions cool in the foil and discard the foil. Chop the onions coarse, discarding the root ends, and in a bowl toss them with the tomatoes, the bacon, and the basil. In a small bowl whisk together the garlic paste, the vinegars, and salt and pepper to taste, add the oil in a stream, whisking, and whisk dressing until it is emulsified. Pour the dressing over the salad, toss the salad well, and serve it, chilled or room temperature, with grilled chicken or beef.

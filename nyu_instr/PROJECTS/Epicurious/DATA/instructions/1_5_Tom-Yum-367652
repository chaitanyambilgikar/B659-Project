Open the coconut with a machete, cleaver, drill, or knife. Pour the coconut water into a blender. With a metal spoon, scoop out the coconut meat and place in the blender with the coconut water. Add the basil, oregano, cilantro, chile, and Braggs and blend until smooth. Pour the soup into individual bowls and garnish each with a few basil leaves.

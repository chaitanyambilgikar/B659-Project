In a 1 1/2- to 2-quart saucepan toast sesame seeds in butter over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until golden and transfer to a small plate. In same pan bring water to a boil with salt and stir in rice. Reduce heat to moderately low and simmer rice, covered, until most liquid is absorbed, about 15 minutes. Remove pan from heat and let rice stand, covered, 5 minutes. Stir in parsley and sesame seeds with any butter remaining on plate.

In a nonstick pan, sauté onion and peppers in oil until soft, 5 to 7 minutes. Add beans and simmer, covered, 5 to 7 minutes. While beans are simmering, warm tortillas in the oven at the lowest temperature. Lay tortillas on a clean flat surface. Spoon 1/4 bean mixture onto each tortilla. Add lettuce and tomatoes. Sprinkle each with 2 tbsp cheese. Fold up the bottom quarter of each tortilla and roll away from you, tucking in the sides as you go. Serve seam side down.

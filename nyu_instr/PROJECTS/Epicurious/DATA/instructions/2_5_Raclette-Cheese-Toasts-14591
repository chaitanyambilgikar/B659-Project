Preheat broiler.
Diagonally cut eight 1/2-inch-thick slices from bread, reserving remainder for another use. On a baking sheet toast one side of bread slices under broiler about 4 inches from heat and leave broiler on. Using a cheese plane thinly slice raclette. Turn bread over and spread 1/2 teaspoon mustard on untoasted side of each slice. Top toasts with cheese and broil until cheese is just melted, about 2 minutes.

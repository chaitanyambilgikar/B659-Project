For each sundae: Fill a bowl, Martini glass, or widemouthed wineglass with 3 generous scoops of vanilla ice cream. Drizzle ice cream with a teaspoon or more of orange liqueur (such as Grand Marnier). Coarsely chop half of a Florentine cookie and sprinkle over the ice cream. Garnish with a whole cookie and 1 or 2 thin strips of orange peel (each about 2 to 3 inches long).

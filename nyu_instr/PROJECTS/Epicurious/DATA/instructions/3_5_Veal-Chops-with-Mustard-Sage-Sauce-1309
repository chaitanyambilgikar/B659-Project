Melt butter with oil in heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle chops with dried sage and pepper. Add to skillet and cook until brown, about 5 minutes per side. Reduce heat to medium and cook to desired doneness, about 1 minute per side for medium-rare. Transfer veal to plate; keep warm.
Add shallots to same skillet and stir 1 minute. Add broth, 1 tablespoon minced sage and mustard to skillet and boil until very thick, scraping up browned bits, about 4 minutes. Add half and half and boil until liquid thickens to sauce consistency, about 1 minute. Mix in remaining 1 tablespoon minced sage and any juices exuded by veal. Adjust seasoning. Place 1 chop on each plate. Spoon sauce over. Garnish with fresh sage leaves and serve.

Cut chicken across the grain into 1-inch-wide slices and toss with soy sauce, garlic, ginger, and 3/4 teaspoon salt. Heat oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over high heat until it shimmers, then cook chicken in 1 layer, without stirring, 2 minutes.
While chicken cooks, cut bok choy crosswise into 1/2-inch pieces. Add to chicken (do not stir) and cook, covered, until bok choy is tender, about 4 minutes. Stir together Sherry, cornstarch, and sugar.
Stir mushrooms, corn, Sherry mixture, and 1/2 teaspoon salt into chicken mixture and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until sauce is thickened slightly and chicken is cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes.

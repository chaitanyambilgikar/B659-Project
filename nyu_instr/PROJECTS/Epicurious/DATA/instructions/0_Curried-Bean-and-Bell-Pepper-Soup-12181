In a blender pureée the beans and the bell pepper with the garlic, the onion, the broth, the curry powder, the lemon juice, and the sugar. Add the half-and-half and blend the mixture until it is just combined. Strain the mixture through a sieve set over a bowl, pressing hard the solids, discard the solids, and chill the soup for 1 hour, or until it is cold. Serve the soup garnished with basil.

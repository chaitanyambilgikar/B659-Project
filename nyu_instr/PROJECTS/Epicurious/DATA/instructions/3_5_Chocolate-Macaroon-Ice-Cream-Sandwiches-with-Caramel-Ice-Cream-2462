For Ice Cream: Stir 1 1/4 cups sugar and water in heavy medium saucepan over medium-low heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat and boil without stirring until deep amber color, brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush and swirling pan occasionally, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat. Gradually add 2 cups cream. Return to low heat. Stir until caramel is smooth.
Whisk yolk and 1/4 cup sugar in large bowl until very thick and pale, about 2 minutes. Combine 2 cups cream and milk in heavy large saucepan. Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add bean. Bring to boil. Gradually whisk into yolk mixture. Return to pan and stir over medium heat until custard thickens and coats spoon, about 4 minutes (do not boil). Remove from heat. Mix in caramel. Strain into bowl. Chill until cold, stirring often.
Freeze custard in ice cream maker. Transfer ice cream to bowl; freeze overnight or up to 3 days.
For Macaroons: Preheat oven to 375°F. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment. Finely grind 1 cup powdered sugar and almonds in processor. Transfer to large bowl. Mix in 1 2/3 cups powdered sugar and cocoa. Beat egg whites in medium bowl until soft peaks form. Fold into nut mixture in 2 additions.
Spoon batter into large pastry bag fitted with 1/2-inch plain tip. Pipe onto prepared sheets in 1 1/2-inch rounds, spacing apart. (Batter will spread to about 2- to 3-inch rounds).
Bake macaroons until puffed and dry-looking on top, about 12 minutes. Cool on sheets on racks. Using spatula, transfer macaroons to work surface.
Spoon 1/4 cup ice cream onto flat side of each of 5 macaroons. Top each with flat side of another macaroon; press lightly. Place sandwiches on baking sheets; cover and freeze. (Can be made 1 day ahead.)

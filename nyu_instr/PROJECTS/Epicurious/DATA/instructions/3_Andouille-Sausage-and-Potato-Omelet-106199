Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add potatoes and sauté until brown, about 7 minutes. Add sausage, pepper, and onion and sauté until vegetables are soft, 6 minutes. Stir in green onion and cumin. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat; keep warm.
Preheat oven to 375°F. Whisk eggs, salt, and pepper in large bowl. Melt butter in heavy large ovenproof skillet over medium heat. Pour in egg mixture. Cook until eggs are almost set in center, tilting pan and lifting edge of omelet with spatula to let uncooked portion flow underneath, about 3 minutes. Distribute sausage mixture over top. Transfer skillet to oven; bake until eggs are completely set, 3 minutes. Run spatula under outer edges of omelet to loosen and slide onto serving plate.

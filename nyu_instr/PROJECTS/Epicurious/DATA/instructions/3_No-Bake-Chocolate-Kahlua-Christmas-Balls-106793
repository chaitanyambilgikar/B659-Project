1. Melt the chocolate chips in evaporated milk in a pot over low heat, stirring constantly, until well blended. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool for about 30 minutes. Combine all remaining ingredients except the coconut; stir into the chocolate mixture, blending well.
2. Shape the mixture into 1- to 1 1/2-inch balls (if the dough is too moist, add up to 1/3 cup more cookie crumbs), then roll in coconut. Let air-dry for 2 hours on waxed paper. Transfer to an airtight container; store in refrigerator. Serve in pleated, brown-paper candy cups.

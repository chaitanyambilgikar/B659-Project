Preheat oven to 450°F. Sauté sausages in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat until cooked through, breaking into small pieces with back of spoon, about 5 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer sausage to bowl. Mix in 1/2 cup cheese, red peppers and pesto; season with salt and pepper.
Lightly sprinkle heavy large baking sheet with flour. Unfold dough on prepared sheet; cut dough in half crosswise. Stretch and/or roll each dough half into thin rectangle, approximately 7 by 10 inches. Press sausage mixture atop 1 dough rectangle, leaving generous 1/2-inch border. Top with second dough rectangle. Roll edges of dough together and press with tines of fork to seal. Cut several slits in top to allow steam to escape.
Bake until crust is pale golden, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle with 3 tablespoons cheese. Bake until cheese melts, about 3 minutes longer. Transfer pizza to work surface. Cut into squares; serve hot.

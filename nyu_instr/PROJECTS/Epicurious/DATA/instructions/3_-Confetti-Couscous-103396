Trim fennel stalks flush with bulb and remove any discolored areas from bulb. Cut bulb into 1/4-inch dice and coarsely chop fronds.
Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then sauté diced fennel and garlic, stirring, 1 minute. Reduce heat to low and cook, covered, until fennel is just tender, about 6 minutes. Add water and salt and bring to a boil.
Remove from heat and stir in tomatoes, lemon juice, zest, couscous, and prunes. Cover skillet and let stand 5 minutes.
Stir in fennel fronds and season with salt and pepper.

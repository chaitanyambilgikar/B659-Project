In a 2-quart microwave-safe casserole with a lid combine the sliced gingerroot, the garlic, the lemon, the soy sauce, and the water and microwave the mixture, uncovered, at high power (100%) for 5 minutes. Add the salmon in one layer and sprinkle it with the minced gingerroot. Microwave the mixture, covered, at medium power (50%) for 5 minutes, or until the salmon just flakes, and transfer the salmon with a slotted spatula to 2 plates. In a bowl whisk together 2 tablespoons of the cooking liquid, the butter, the parsley, and salt and pepper to taste and spoon the sauce over the salmon.

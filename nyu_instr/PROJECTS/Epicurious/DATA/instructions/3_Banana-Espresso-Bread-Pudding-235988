Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 325°F.
Arrange bread in 2 layers in a 2-quart (8-inch square) baking dish.
Whisk together half-and-half, yolks, 3/4 cup sugar, and espresso powder, then pour over bread and soak 10 minutes.
Cook bananas in butter in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat, turning over once, until golden brown, about 6 minutes total. Lay bananas, cut sides up, over bread and sprinkle evenly with remaining tablespoon sugar. Bake, uncovered, until custard is set, 50 minutes to 1 hour. Serve warm.

Stir first 4 ingredients in small bowl until sugar dissolves. Melt butter with 2 tablespoons oil in small saucepan over medium heat. Add fish sauce mixture and green onions and simmer until sauce begins to thicken, about 2 minutes.
Do ahead: Butter sauce can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.
Preheat barbecue (medium-high heat). Brush corn with oil. Grill corn until tender and charred in spots, about 13 minutes. Brush corn generously with butter sauce and serve, passing remaining sauce separately.
*Fish sauce is a versatile ingredient. Try it (1) mixed with garlic and cilantro as a marinade for grilled chicken; (2) in barbecue sauce for ribs; (3) in a salad of slivered green apples and chopped cilantro; and (4) in a compound butter with cayenne and shallots for grilled fish. It is available in the Asian foods section of many supermarkets and at Asian markets.

Preheat oven to 375°F. Toss garlic with oil in small baking dish. Cover with foil. Bake until garlic is tender, about 30 minutes. Uncover and bake until garlic is very tender, about 10 minutes linger. Cool garlic; peel. Puree garlic in processor. Set puree aside.
Bring 5 1/2 cups chicken stock and 1 tablespoon butter to boil in large saucepan. Reduce heat to medium. Gradually whisk in yellow cornmeal. Continue to cook until mixture is creamy, whisking occasionally and adding more chicken stock 1/4 cup at a time as necessary to keep polenta soft, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat. Mix in cheese, chopped parsley and roasted garlic puree. Season polenta to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer to bowl and serve.

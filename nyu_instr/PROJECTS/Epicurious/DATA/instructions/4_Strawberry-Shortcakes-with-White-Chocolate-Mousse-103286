For shortcakes: Preheat oven to 425°F. Line baking sheet with parchment paper. Blend flour, 3 tablespoons sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt in processor. Add butter and process using on/off turns until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add 1/2 cup buttermilk and process just until moist clumps form. Blend in chopped chocolate using on/off turns.
Turn dough out onto lightly floured work surface. Dust lightly with flour. Gently press dough to 1/2-inch thickness. Using 3 1/4-inch cutter, cut out shortcakes. Gather dough scraps and press to 1/2-inch thickness; cut out additional shortcakes for a total of 6. Transfer shortcakes to prepared baking sheet. Brush shortcakes with remaining 1 tablespoon buttermilk. Sprinkle with 1 teaspoon sugar.
Bake shortcakes until golden and tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 15 minutes. Transfer to rack and cool. (Can be prepared 8 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.)
For topping: Toss strawberries, sugar and liqueur in large bowl. Let stand at room temperature until juices form, tossing occasionally, about 1 hour.
Cut shortcakes horizontally in half. Place 1 shortcake bottom on each of 6 plates. Spoon 1/3 cup White Chocolate Mousse over each. Spoon some of strawberry topping over each. Cover each with shortcake top. Top each with spoonful of mousse, then more strawberry topping and serve.

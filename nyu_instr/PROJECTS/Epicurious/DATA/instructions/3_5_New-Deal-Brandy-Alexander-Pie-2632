For Crust: Preheat oven to 350°F. Finely grind ground chocolate cookies and half of semisweet chocolate in processor. Add melted butter and blend in using on/off turns until moist crumbs form. Press mixture onto bottom and up sides of 9 1/2-inch-diameter deep-dish glass pie dish. Bake until crust is set, about 10 minutes. Remove from oven. Sprinkle remaining chocolate over crust; let melt. Using back of spoon, gently spread chocolate over crust. Cool.
For Filling: Combine 1/4 cup whipping cream and 1/4 cup crème de cacao in heavy medium saucepan. Sprinkle gelatin over and whisk to blend. Let stand 10 minutes to soften. Stir over low heat until gelatin dissolves. Add white chocolate and stir until melted and smooth. Stir in brandy. Transfer mixture to large bowl and cool, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes. Beat remaining 1 cup cream and 1/2 cup sour cream in medium bowl to stiff peaks. Fold cream into white chocolate mixture in 2 additions. Transfer filling to crust. Refrigerate until filling sets, at least 4 hours or overnight.
Mound chocolate curls atop pie. Cut into wedges and serve.

Preheat oven to 450°F.
In a small skillet or saucepan melt butter over moderate heat and cook scallion, seasoned with salt, until softened but not browned.
In a bowl whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Blend in shortening with pastry blender or fingertips until mixture resembles coarse meal and stir in milk to form a soft dough. In a bowl knead dough gently with lightly floured hands 8 times.
On an ungreased small baking sheet pat dough into a 4-inch square and cut into quarters. Separate quarters on baking sheet and brush each with some scallion butter. Bake biscuits 15 minutes, or until tops are golden, and serve warm.

In a large bowl whisk together the egg, the mayonnaise, the mustard, the pimiento, the parsley, the Old Bay Seasoning, the Worcestershire sauce, the Tabasco, the pepper, and the salt, add the crab meat and 1/4 cup of the Saltines, and toss the mixture gently. Spread the remaining 1/2 cup Saltines on a plate, form the crab mixture with a 1/3-cup measure gently into eight 3/4-inch-thick patties, and coat the top and bottoms of each patty carefully with the Saltines, transferring the crab cakes as they are formed to a sheet of wax paper. In a large skillet heat the oil and the butter over moderately high heat until the foam subsides and in the fat sauté the crab cakes, in batches if necessary, for 1 to 2 minutes on each side, or until they are golden, transferring them as they are cooked to a heated platter. Serve the crab cakes with the lemon wedges.

Bring 5 1/2 cups water, salt, and garlic to boil in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat. Gradually add cornmeal, whisking until smooth. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until thick and creamy, whisking constantly, about 8 minutes. Stir in Brie and half of Parmesan cheese. Season to taste with cayenne pepper, white pepper, and nutmeg. Whisk until polenta thickens slightly, about 2 minutes. Transfer to large bowl. Sprinkle with remaining Parmesan cheese and serve. (Can be made 2 hours ahead. Cover and let stand at room temperature. Rewarm in 450°F oven for 10 minutes, thinning with more water if needed.)

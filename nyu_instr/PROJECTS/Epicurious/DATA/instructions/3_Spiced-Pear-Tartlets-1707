Preheat oven to 425°F. Roll out 1 pastry sheet on floured work surface to 1/8-inch thickness (about 12-inch square). Cut out two 6-inch rounds. Repeat rolling and cutting with second sheet, forming total of 4 rounds (reserve remaining pastry for another use). Place rounds on 2 heavy large baking sheets.
Using 1/2 pear per tartlet, overlap slices in circle atop each round, leaving 1/2-inch border at outside edge. Brush each tartlet with melted butter. Sprinkle each with 1 tablespoon sugar and pinch of cloves. Bake until pastry is golden brown and pears are tender, about 20 minutes. Transfer tartlets to plates. Serve warm with ice cream.

To make the sauce: In a medium bowl, toss the cucumber with the salt. Let stand about 1 hour. Transfer to a sieve and rinse well under cold running water. Pat the cucumber dry.
In a small bowl, mix the drained cucumber, mayonnaise, scallion, capers, and anchovy paste. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. (The tartar sauce can be prepared up to 3 days ahead.)
To make the crab cakes: Mix the 1/2 cup bread crumbs, the mayonnaise, egg, mustard, scallion, Worcestershire sauce, and Delmarva or Old Bay seasoning. Mix in the crabmeat with wet hands, form into 6 cakes about 3 inches wide. Place the remaining 1/2 cup bread crumbs in a deep plate. Coat the crab cakes in the crumbs and set aside.
Line a baking sheet with paper towels. Into a large deep skillet (preferably cast iron), pour vegetable oil to a depth of 1/2 inch, and heat over high heat until very hot but not smoking. Carefully add the crab cakes and cook, turning once, until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Using a slotted spatula, transfer to the paper towels to drain. Serve hot, with the tartar sauce on the side.
To make Delmarva Seasoning: Mix 2 teaspoons salt, 1 teaspoon ground celery seed, 1 teaspoon dry mustard, 1 teaspoon sweet paprika, 1 teaspoon ground black pepper, 1 teaspoon ground bay leaf, 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves, 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice, 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger, 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg, 1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom, and 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon. Will keep indefinitely in a tightly covered container in a cool, dark place. Makes about 3 tablespoons.

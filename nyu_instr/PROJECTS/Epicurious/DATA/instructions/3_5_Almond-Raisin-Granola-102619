Preheat oven to 250°F. Lightly spray rimmed baking sheet with nonstick spray. Toss oats and next 3 ingredients in large bowl. Whisk syrup, brown sugar, oil, 2 tablespoons warm water and salt in small bowl to blend. Pour syrup mixture over oat mixture and stir to combine. Transfer to prepared baking sheet. Bake until evenly browned, stirring occasionally, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Cool. Transfer to large bowl. Mix in raisins. (Can be made 1 week ahead. Store in airtight container.)

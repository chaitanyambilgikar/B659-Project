Pat chicken dry and sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt. Heat oil in an ovenproof 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until just beginning to smoke, then cook chicken, skin sides down, until browned, about 5 minutes. Turn chicken over and cook 2 minutes more, then transfer to a plate.
Pour off all but 2 tablespoons fat from skillet and cook bell peppers, onion, garlic, red pepper flakes (to taste), and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt over moderate heat, stirring, until softened, about 10 minutes. Add wine and boil 1 minute. Nestle chicken, skin sides up, into pepper mixture and cook, covered, over moderate heat until cooked through, about 15 minutes.
Turn on broiler. Remove lid from skillet and broil chicken 4 to 6 inches from heat until skin is crisp, about 1 1/2 minutes.

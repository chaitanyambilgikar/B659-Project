Preheat oven to 450° F.
Butter baguette slices on 1 side and on a baking sheet toast in middle of oven 5 minutes, or until pale golden. Toasts may be made 1 day ahead, cooled completely, and kept in a sealable plastic bag at room temperature.
Preheat broiler.
In a large bowl whisk together shallot, vinegar, and mustard and add oil in a slow stream, whisking until emulsified. Cut Camembert into 4 wedges. Top each toast with a wedge of Camembert and on baking sheet broil about 4 inches from heat 5 minutes, or until cheese begins to melt. Add greens and currants to vinaigrette, tossing to coat.
Serve salad topped with Camembert croûtes.

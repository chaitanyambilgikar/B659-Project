In a 1-quart microwave-safe measuring cup or soufflé dish whisk together vegetable oil or rendered fat and flour until combined well. Microwave roux, uncovered, at high power (100%), whisking at 2-minute intervals, 8 minutes. If roux is not the dark reddish-brown color of chestnut shells, microwave at high power, whisking and checking color at 1-minute intervals, until roux reaches desired color. Roux may be made 1 week ahead, cooled completely, and chilled, covered. Reheat roux before using.

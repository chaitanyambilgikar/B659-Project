Turn on the oven to 375°.
Choose a mixing bowl that can subsequently contain all the ingredients. Put in the eggs and sugar and beat them until they are foamy and form yellow ribbons.
Add the salt, olive oil, and grated orange peel â€” making sure you haven't grated any of the bitter white pith beneath the orange skin â€” and mix thoroughly.
Peel all the fruit. Core the pear and apple and cut them into thin 1/2-inch pieces. Slice the banana very thin. Put the fruit into a separate bowl and toss with the lemon juice.
Combine the flour and baking powder and mix them into the beaten eggs, incorporating them thoroughly.
Add the fruit to the bowl with the eggs and flour, mixing well to distribute it evenly.
Smear the bottom and sides of the springform pan with butter, then pour into it the fruit batter. Level off by shaking the pan from side to side; do not press down on the batter.
Bake on the middle level of the preheated oven for 50 to 55 minutes, until the top of the cake becomes colored a light gold.

Lift stack; place stack, buttered side down, on 1 ramekin. press stack firmly, molding to ramekin. repeat buttering, cutting, stacking and shaping with remaining phyllo, using 5 squares for each stack and making a total of 6 cups. Brush outside of phyllo with butter mixture.

Slide spatula under phyllo and ramekins and lift from baking sheet. Remove phyllo from ramekins and place upright on baking sheets; cool completely. (Can be prepared 3 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.)

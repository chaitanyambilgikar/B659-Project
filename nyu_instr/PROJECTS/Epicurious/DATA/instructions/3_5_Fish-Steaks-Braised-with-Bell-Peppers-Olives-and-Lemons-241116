Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onion and bell pepper. Sauté until onion is translucent, about 12 minutes. Add garlic and stir 1 minute. Add olives, lemons, and wine and bring to boil.
Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in heavy large skillet over high heat. Sprinkle fish steaks with salt and pepper. Add to skillet and sauté until first side browns, about 2 minutes.
Turn fish over. Add bell pepper mixture and juices; add parsley. Reduce heat to medium; simmer uncovered until fish is just opaque in center, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
Divide fish and sauce among shallow bowls; drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil.

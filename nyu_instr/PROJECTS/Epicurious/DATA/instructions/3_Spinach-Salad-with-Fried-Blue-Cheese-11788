In a large bowl with a fork mash the garlic to a paste with the salt, add the vinegar, the Worcestershire sauce, and the olive oil, and combine the dressing well. Add the spinach to the dressing and toss the salad well.
Have ready in separate bowls the flour, the egg, beaten lightly, and the bread crumbs. Dredge the cheese cubes in the flour, shaking off the excess, coat them thoroughly with the egg, and dredge them in the bread crumbs, patting the crumbs on to help them adhere. In a saucepan heat 2 inches of the vegetable oil to 350°F. on a deep-fat thermometer and in it fry the cheese cubes in batches for 45 seconds, or until they are golden, transferring them as they are fried with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain. Divide the spinach salad between 2 bowls and top it with the fried cheese.

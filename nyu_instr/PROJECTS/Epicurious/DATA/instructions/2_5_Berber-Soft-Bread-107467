Mix flour and salt in processor. Add 1 cup hot water and 4 tablespoons oil; blend until ball forms. Remove dough from processor. Using oiled hands, divide dough into 3 equal pieces. Roll each piece on lightly floured surface into 9-inch round about 1/4 inch thick. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in medium (10-inch-diameter) nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add 1 dough round to skillet; reduce heat to medium-low and cook until golden on bottom, about 5 minutes. Turn bread over; cook until golden on bottom and bread is cooked through, about 5 minutes. Transfer bread to plate. Tent with foil to keep warm. Repeat with remaining oil and dough. Break warm bread into pieces, drizzle with honey, and serve.

Make the crust: In a bowl blend together the cracker crumbs, the walnuts, the butter, and salt and pepper to taste. Press the mixture onto the bottom of a buttered 10-inch springform pan and bake the crust in the middle of a preheated 325°F. oven for 10 minutes.
Make the pesto: In a food processor purée the basil, the sun-dried tomatoes with the reserved oil, the garlic, the Parmesan, the pine nuts, salt and pepper to taste until the mixture is smooth.
Make the filling: In the bowl of an electric mixer blend together the mascarpone, the cream cheese, the eggs, and the flour until the mixture is very smooth.
Pour half the filling into the crust, spoon the pesto over it, spreading the pesto carefully with the back of a spoon, and spread the remaining filling over the pesto. Bake the cheesecake in the middle of a preheated 325°F. oven for 1 hour.
In a bowl blend together the sour cream and the flour, spread the sour cream topping on the cheesecake, and bake the cheesecake for 5 to 10 minutes more, or until it is set. Let the cheesecake cool in the pan on a rack and chill it, covered loosely, for at least 3 hours or overnight. Remove the side of the pan, garnish the cheesecake with the sun-dried tomato slices and the basil, and serve it with the greens.

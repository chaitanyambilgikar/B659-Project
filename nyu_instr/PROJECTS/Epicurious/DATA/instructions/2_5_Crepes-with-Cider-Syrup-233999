Make crêpe batter: Whisk together flour, milk, eggs, shortening, baking powder, sugar, and salt in a large bowl until smooth (batter will be thick). Chill, covered, 30 minutes.
Make syrup: Heat butter (not melted) in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat until foam subsides. Add cider and sugar and stir until sugar is dissolved, then briskly simmer until thickened and reduced to about 1 1/2 cups, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat.
Cook crêpes: Lightly brush an 8-inch well-seasoned crêpe pan or nonstick skillet with some melted butter, then heat over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking.
Remove skillet from heat and pour in a scant 1/4 cup batter, immediately tilting and rotating skillet to coat bottom. (If batter sets before skillet is coated, reduce heat slightly for next crêpe.) Return skillet to heat and cook crêpe until set and golden brown underneath, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Loosen edge of crêpe with a heatproof rubber spatula, then flip crêpe over carefully with your fingertips and cook until just set, about 15 seconds more. Transfer crêpe to a plate. Make 7 more crêpes in same manner, brushing skillet with more butter before each one and transferring them as cooked to plate and stacking them.
Reheat syrup over moderate heat. Fold each crêpe into quarters, then, using tongs, dip each briefly in syrup to coat and transfer to a platter. Cover crêpes with foil to keep warm.
Serve crêpes with remaining syrup on the side.

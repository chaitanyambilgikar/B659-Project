Heat oil in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add meat, onion, carrot, celery, and garlic; sauté until meat begins to brown, about 8 minutes. Add wine and cook until wine evaporates, stirring often, about 3 minutes. Stir in tomatoes with juices, half and half, and oregano. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until thickened, about 25 minutes. Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.
Meanwhile, cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite. Drain and divide among 4 plates. Spoon sauce over pasta. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and serve.

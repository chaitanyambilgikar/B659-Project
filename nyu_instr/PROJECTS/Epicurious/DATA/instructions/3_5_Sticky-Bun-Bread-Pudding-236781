Preheat oven to 350°F. Whisk eggs, 2 cups half and half, and vanilla in medium bowl to blend; set aside. Stir pecans, brown sugar, and cinnamon in small bowl to blend; set aside. Butter bread on both sides. Place 2 slices bread in bottom of 9x5x3-inch loaf pan, cutting additional bread pieces to fit snugly. Sprinkle bread with 1/3 of pecan mixture. Repeat twice with remaining bread and pecan mixture (bread will reach top of pan). Press on bread to compact. Pour egg mixture over bread by 1/2 cupfuls, saturating bread.
Place loaf pan in center of 13x9-inch baking pan; set in oven. Pour enough hot water into baking pan to come halfway up sides of loaf pan. Bake until pudding is set, about 45 minutes. Remove pan from water; cool slightly. Turn loaf out.
Whisk powdered sugar and 2 tablespoons half and half in medium bowl to blend, adding more half and half if necessary to thin glaze. Slice warm bread pudding thickly and transfer to plates. Drizzle bread pudding slices with powdered sugar glaze and serve.

Add onion and cook until beginning to brown, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes. Add rice and stir to coat with onion mixture. Mix in water and bring to boil. Cover pan, reduce heat to low and cook until rice is tender and water is absorbed, about 20 minutes. Fluff pilaf with fork. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to bowl.

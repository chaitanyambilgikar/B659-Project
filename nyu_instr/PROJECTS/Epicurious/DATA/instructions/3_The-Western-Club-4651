Stir mayonnaise, cilantro and jalapeños in small bowl to blend. Season dressing to taste with salt.
Place 2 bread slices on plates. Spread each with 1/4 of dressing. Top with turkey, onion, a second bread slice, remaining dressing, avocado slices and sprouts. Place third bread slice atop each sandwich; press to compact slightly. Cut sandwiches into quarters; skewer together with extra-long toothpicks, if desired.

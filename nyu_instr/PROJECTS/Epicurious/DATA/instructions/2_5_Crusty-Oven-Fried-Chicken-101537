Use the palms of your hands to pat the chicken to an even thickness. In a shallow bowl, combine the buttermilk, Worcestershire, and hot pepper sauce. Add the chicken, turning to coat. Let the chicken soak in the sauce for 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 450°F. Lightly coat a baking sheet with vegetable oil spray. In a shallow dish, combine the flour, cornmeal, lemon peel, salt, and cayenne pepper. Remove the chicken from the buttermilk and dip it into the flour mixture to coat completely. Place the chicken on the prepared baking sheet, leaving at least 1 inch between each piece. Drizzle with the oil.
Bake the chicken until the coating is golden brown and crusty and the chicken is white throughout, about 20 minutes. Serve garnished with lemon wedges.

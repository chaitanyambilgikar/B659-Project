Make salsa: Wearing rubber gloves, remove stems, seeds, and ribs from chili and chop fine.
In a bowl stir together chili and remaining salsa ingredients. Salsa may be made several hours ahead and chilled, covered.
Stack tortillas and cut them in half. Cut stacks crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick strips and in a heavy skillet heat 1/2 inch oil over moderate heat until hot but not smoking. Working in three batches, fry tortilla strips until crisp and golden, about 30 seconds, and with a slotted spoon transfer to paper towels to drain. Sprinkle fried tortilla strips with salt to taste.
Halve avocados, removing pits, and peel. Slice each half lengthwise into 6 wedges and fan onto 4 salad plates.
Spoon about 1/3 cup strawberry salsa over each avocado fan and mound crispy tortilla strips alongside.

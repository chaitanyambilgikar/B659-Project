Prepare grill.
Peel, pit, and coarsely chop mango. Finely chop shallot. In a blender purée mango and shallot with lime juice, sugar, cayenne, and salt and pepper to taste until smooth. Transfer sauce to a bowl and if too thick whisk in some water, 1 tablespoon at a time. Pat lamb dry and season with salt and pepper. Grill lamb on a lightly oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals about 4 minutes on each side for medium-rare.
Serve chops topped with sauce and garnished with lime wedges and cilantro.

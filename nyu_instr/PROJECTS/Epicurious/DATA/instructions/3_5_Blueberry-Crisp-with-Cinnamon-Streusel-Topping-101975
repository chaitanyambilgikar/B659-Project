Preheat oven to 350°F. Combine 2 1/2 cups blueberries and 3/4 cup sugar in large saucepan. Cook over low heat until berries soften and release their juices, stirring frequently, about 8 minutes. Mix in remaining blueberries. Transfer mixture to 13 x 9 x 2-inch glass baking dish.
Mix flour, walnuts, brown sugar, cinnamon, salt and remaining 6 tablespoons sugar in large bowl to blend. Gradually add cooled melted butter, mixing with fork until small moist clumps form. Sprinkle streusel over berries.
Bake until topping is crisp and golden and filling is bubbling, about 45 minutes. Cool slightly. Serve with whipped cream.

Preheat oven to 350°F.
Stir together honey and pecans, tossing to coat well. Spread pecans in 1 layer in a shallow baking pan and sprinkle with sugar. Bake in middle of oven 15 minutes, then stir and bake 5 minutes more.
Transfer while still warm to a sheet of parchment paper or foil and, working quickly, separate pecans with a fork. Cool completely (about 1 hour) and remove nuts from parchment, breaking up any large pieces.

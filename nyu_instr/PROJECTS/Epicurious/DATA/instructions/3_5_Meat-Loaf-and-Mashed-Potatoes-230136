For meat loaf: Preheat oven to 375°F. Pour wine into a medium skillet and cook onion, pepper, and carrot over low to medium heat for 15 minutes. In a separate bowl, combine remaining ingredients and mix thoroughly, using hands. Spoon in vegetables and liquid from skillet. Shape mixture into a loaf approximately 5" wide, 10" long, and 3" to 4" high. Coat a 9" x 13" baking pan (or bread-loaf pan) with cooking spray, then fill with mixture. Bake 1 hour; let stand for 5 minutes before slicing. Top each slice with 1/4 cup warmed pasta sauce and basil leaf.
Mashed Potatoes Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add potatoes and simmer 15 minutes or until they yield to soft pressure. Drain, then transfer to a serving bowl. Using a potato masher or hand mixer, combine remaining ingredients. Serve warm with meat loaf.

Preheat the oven to 400°F. In a bowl whisk together the egg, the onion, the bell pepper, 2 tablespoons of the ketchup, the Saltines, the Worcestershire sauce, the salt, and pepper to taste, add the chuck, and blend the mixture with your hands until it is just combined (do not overmix). Form the mixture into an 8- by 4-inch loaf in a shallow baking pan, spread the remaining tablespoon ketchup over it, and drape the bacon pieces across the loaf. Bake the meat loaf in the middle of the oven for 30 minutes.

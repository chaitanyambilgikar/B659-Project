Dredge the cutlets in the flour mixture, shaking off the excess, in a heavy skillet (preferably cast-iron) heat the oil over moderately high heat until it is hot but not smoking, and in it sauté the cutlets for 1 to 2 minutes on each side, or until they are golden brown on the edges and cooked through. Transfer 2 cutlets to each of 2 plates and keep them warm. To the skillet add the broth, the vinegar, the chili powder, the cayenne, and salt to taste, deglaze the skillet over moderately high heat, scraping up the brown bits, and stir in the tomatoes, the scallions, and the jalapeño. Cook the sauce until it is thickened, pour it over the cutlets, and sprinkle the cutlets with the peanuts and the coriander.

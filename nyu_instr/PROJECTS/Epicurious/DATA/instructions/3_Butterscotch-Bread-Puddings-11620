Preheat oven to 350°F.
Butter two 1 1/4-cup ramekins and divide bread cubes between them.
In a small saucepan heat half-and-half, butter, salt, and vanilla over moderate heat until hot. In a small bowl whisk together sugar, egg, and yolk and add half-and-half mixture in a stream, whisking. Pour mixture over bread cubes and bake puddings in middle of oven until puffed and golden, about 25 to 30 minutes.
Serve puddings warm with ice cream.

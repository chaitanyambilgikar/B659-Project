Combine the ingredients for the snap pea salad. Allow the salad to marinate for about half an hour in the refrigerator.
Purée the currants through a fine sieve. Discard solids and reserve liquids.
Peel the apple and juice it in a juicer, or substitute fresh apple cider.
Combine the currant purée with the apple juice, and slowly whisk in the olive oil. When the oil is incorporated, season with salt, white pepper, and a few drops of porcini oil. (Use porcini oil sparingly, as too much will dominate the other flavors.) Cover and reserve in refrigerator.
Using a very sharp knife, slice the tuna against the grain into 1/8-inch-thick slices. Sprinkle with sea salt and freshly ground pepper. Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil.
To serve, lay the slices of fish over some of the pea salad and brush with the red apple vinaigrette. Garnish with the most delicate white leaves of frisée and a few sprigs of micro red radish.
*You can substitute 1/2 cup fresh apple cider plus 1 teaspoon lemon juice.

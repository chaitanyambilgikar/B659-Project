Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter six 3/4-cup soufflé dishes or custard cups. Stir chocolate and butter in heavy medium saucepan over medium-low heat until melted and smooth; cool to lukewarm. Using electric mixer, beat eggs, egg yolks, sugar and salt in large bowl at high speed until pale yellow and thick, about 5 minutes. Fold cooled chocolate into egg mixture. Sift flour over; fold until well incorporated. Divide batter equally among prepared dishes. Transfer to baking sheet.
Bake until set at edges but still soft in center, about 18 minutes. Serve warm with whipped cream.

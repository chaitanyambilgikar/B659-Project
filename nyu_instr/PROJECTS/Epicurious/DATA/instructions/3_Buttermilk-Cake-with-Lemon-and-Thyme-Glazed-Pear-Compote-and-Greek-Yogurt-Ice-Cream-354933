For pear compote: Combine 3/4 cup sugar, 1/2 cup water, lemon juice, 3/4 teaspoon lemon peel, and 3/4 teaspoon thyme in medium saucepan. Stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves and mixture boils. Remove saucepan from heat; cover. Let steep 10 minutes. Pour syrup through fine strainer set over bowl. Return syrup to saucepan. Add 3/4 teaspoon lemon peel and 3/4 teaspoon thyme and bring to simmer. Add pear cubes and simmer over medium heat until pears are tender but still hold shape, about 10 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer pear to rimmed baking sheet. Boil syrup in saucepan until reduced to 1/3 cup, about 5 minutes. Transfer reduced syrup to blender. Add 1/3 cup pear pieces; puree until smooth. Transfer pear puree to medium bowl. Add remaining pear pieces to puree. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.

Prepare grill.
Grill bratwursts on an oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals, turning occasionally, until cooked through and dark golden brown, about 20 minutes. (You will need to mist the coals with water to keep "brats" from being scorched when fat drips down and flames erupt.)
Put a pair of brats, cut in half lengthwise and stacked, on each roll.
Smother brats with accompaniments.

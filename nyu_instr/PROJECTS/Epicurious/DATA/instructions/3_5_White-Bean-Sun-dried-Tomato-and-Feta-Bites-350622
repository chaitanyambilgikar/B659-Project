Preheat oven to 350°F.
In small saucepan over moderately low heat, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil and tomato oil until hot but not smoking. Add pine nuts and toast, stirring occasionally, until light golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in garlic, thyme, and red pepper flakes. Continue stirring until mixture cools slightly, about 3 minutes. Stir in beans, tomatoes, lemon juice, basil, Parmesan, and Feta. (Topping can be prepared ahead and refrigerated, covered, up to 6 hours. Before serving, bring to room temperature.)
Arrange bread squares on parchment-lined baking sheet and brush on both sides with remaining 4 tablespoons olive oil. Toast, turning once, until light golden brown, about 3 minutes per side.
Top squares with white bean topping and serve immediately. (Alternately, serve white bean, sun-dried tomato, and Feta mixture in bowl and arrange toast squares alongside.)

Into a bowl sift together the flour, the baking powder, the sugar, the salt, and the mustard and stir in the Cheddar. In another bowl whisk together the egg, the milk, and the butter, add the mixture to the flour mixture, and stir the batter until it is just combined. Divide the batter among 12 well-buttered 1/3-cup muffin tins, sprinkle the muffins with the caraway seeds, and bake them in the middle of a preheated 350°F. oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until they are golden. Let the muffins cool in the tins for 2 minutes and turn them out onto a rack.

In a large bowl gently stir together tomatoes, onion, garlic paste, vinegar, and 1/4 cup oil
Brush one side of zucchini slices lightly with additional oil and season with salt and pepper. Heat a well-seasoned ridged grill pan over moderate heat until hot and grill zucchini, oiled sides down, in batches, brushing tops with more oil before turning, 1 to 2 minutes on each side, or until just tender but not soft. Transfer zucchini as grilled to a small bowl.
In a kettle of salted boiling water cook pasta until just tender and drain well. Add hot pasta to tomato mixture and toss well. Cool pasta slightly and stir in zucchini, olives, cheese, basil, and salt and pepper to taste. Pasta may be made 4 hours ahead and kept covered at room temperature.
Serve pasta warm or at room temperature.

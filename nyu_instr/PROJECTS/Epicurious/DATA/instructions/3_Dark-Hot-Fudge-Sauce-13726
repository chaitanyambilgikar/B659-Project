In a small heavy saucepan heat heavy cream and sugar over moderate heat, stirring, until sugar is dissolved. Add chocolate, butter, and corn syrup and continue to cook, stirring, just until smooth. Bring mixture to a boil over moderate heat and boil 8 minutes. Remove pan from heat and stir in vanilla and salt. Sauce keeps, covered and chilled, 3 weeks. Let sauce cool completely before covering (any condensation will make it grainy). Reheat sauce, uncovered, over simmering water in a double boiler. Serve sauce hot over ice cream.

Stir together mayonnaise, garlic, and curry powder to make aïoli.
Lightly toast tortillas, 1 at a time, directly on burner (gas or electric) at moderately low heat, turning over once with tongs, until browned in spots but still flexible, about 30 seconds on each side.
Spread 2 tablespoons curried aïoli on each tortilla. Divide lettuce, onion, apple, pear, and turkey among tortillas, layering them evenly. Tightly roll up tortillas and cut in half diagonally.

Season stew meat with pepper, oregano, and garlic powder. Dust with flour. Heat oil in large casserole. Sauté meat until browned. Add garlic, onions, carrots, bay leaf, wine, and broth. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours or until venison is tender. Add potatoes and cook another 30 minutes, or until potatoes are tender. Mix cornstarch with an equal amount of water. Stir into stew until mixture has thickened.

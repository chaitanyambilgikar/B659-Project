Cut 36 (1/3-inch-thick) slices from cucumbers, reserving remaining cucumber. Scoop out and discard some cucumber from center of each round with a melon-ball cutter or a small spoon to create an indentation (leaving bottom intact).
Cut enough of remaining cucumber into 1/4-inch dice to measure 1/2 cup.
Toss diced cucumber with apple, sour cream, shallot, zest, lemon juice, pepper, chopped dill, and salt to taste. Fold in whitefish.
Mound 1 to 1 1/2 teaspoons fish mixture onto each cucumber round. Top with dill sprigs.

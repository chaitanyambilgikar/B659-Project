1. Bring at least 5 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot and add a tiny pinch of salt. Drop in the pasta, stir and cover the pot. When the water returns to a boil, remove the lid and cook, uncovered, until the pasta is al dente. Reserve about 1/2 cup of the cooking water and drain the pasta.
2. Return the still-dripping pasta to the pot in which it was boiled. Away from any direct source of heat, stir in the reserved pasta water and toss vigorously while sprinkling in about 1 cup of the cheese and the pepper.
3. Serve immediately in pasta bowls with the remaining 1 cup Pecorino Romano on the side.

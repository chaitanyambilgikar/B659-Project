Preheat oven to 350°F.
With a sharp thin knife thinly slice kumquats crosswise, removing seeds. Break cinnamon sticks in half. In a small saucepan bring sugar, corn syrup, and water to a boil with cinnamon sticks, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Add kumquats and gently simmer until kumquats are translucent and syrup is slightly thickened, about 15 minutes.
Diagonally cut eight 1/2-inch-thick slices from baguette and melt butter. Lightly brush butter onto both sides of baguette slices and arrange on a baking sheet. Toast slices in upper third of oven until pale golden, about 10 minutes.
Squeeze juice from 2 tangerines and pour through a sieve into kumquat mixture. With a sharp knife cut peel from remaining 2 tangerines, including all white pith, and cut sections free from membranes. Squeeze any juice from membranes into kumquat mixture. Bring kumquat mixture to a simmer and add tangerine sections. Remove pan from heat.
Dip toasts into syrup to coat both sides and arrange 2 toasts on each of 4 small plates. Spoon fruit and remaining syrup over toasts and garnish each serving with a piece of cinnamon stick.

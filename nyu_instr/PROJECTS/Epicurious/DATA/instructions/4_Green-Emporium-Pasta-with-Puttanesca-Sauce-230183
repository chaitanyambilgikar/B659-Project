Crush tomatoes with your hands. In a large nonstick pot, sauté garlic in oil until golden brown, taking care not to burn. Add tomatoes and simmer 10 minutes on a low flame. In a separate medium-sized pot, bring water to boil. Add olives and capers to tomatoes and cook 10 minutes more. Meanwhile, add linguine to the boiling water. When pasta is cooked through yet slightly firm, about 8 minutes, drain and divide among 4 bowls. Top with sauce; sprinkle with fresh basil and Parmesan to taste.

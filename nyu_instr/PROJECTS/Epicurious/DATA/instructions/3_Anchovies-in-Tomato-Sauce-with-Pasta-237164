Heat a pan, add 6 tablespoons of olive oil, then add your garlic and fry slowly. As it begins to color, add the pine nuts, raisins, and anchovies and continue frying for 2 minutes, until the anchovies have melted. Add the tomato purée and the wine and stir in well. Leave to simmer on a medium heat for 3 minutes. The sauce should be quite thick, like tomato sauce, but if you think it needs thinning down, add a little water. Heat a little olive oil in a separate pan, add the bread crumbs and fry until toasted, crunchy, and golden. Leave to cool on paper towels. Meanwhile, cook your pasta in boiling salted water according to the package instructions. Drain and mix with the sauce. Check the seasoning and divide onto 4 plates, twizzling the pasta with tongs as you go. Serve sprinkled with the bread crumbs.

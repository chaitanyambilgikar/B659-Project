Whisk together matzo meal and 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper. Pat fish dry and season with 1/2 teaspoon salt. Dredge in matzo meal to lightly coat, shaking off excess.
Heat oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Fry fish in 3 batches, turning if necessary, until just cooked through, about 1 minute for sardines or 2 to 3 minutes for mackerel. Transfer with a slotted spoon to shallow dish.
Reduce heat to medium and cook garlic in oil remaining in skillet until it just turns golden, about 30 seconds. Add onion and carrot and cook, stirring occasionally, until crisp-tender, 6 to 8 minutes. Add paprika and oregano and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add wine, vinegar, cinnamon stick, zests, and 1 1/4 teaspoons salt and simmer, uncovered, 15 minutes. Cool sauce to room temperature, then pour over fish and marinate, chilled, at least 12 hours.
Bring to room temperature before serving and season with salt if necessary.

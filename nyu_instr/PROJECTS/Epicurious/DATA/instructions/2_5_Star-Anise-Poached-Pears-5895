Combine sugar, 2 tablespoons water, star anise, cloves, cinnamon stick and vanilla bean in heavy large saucepan. Stir over low heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat and boil without stirring until syrup turns deep amber, occasionally brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush and swirling pan, about 9 minutes. Remove from heat. Add 1 1/4 cups water (mixture will bubble vigorously). Bring to simmer, stirring until pieces of caramel dissolve. Add pears, cover and simmer until tender, turning pears once, about 5 minutes.
Using slotted spoon, transfer pears to bowl. Boil liquid in saucepan until thick and syrupy, about 5 minutes. Pour syrup over pears; toss gently to coat. Chill until cold, at least 3 hours or overnight. Divide pears and syrup among 4 shallow bowls and serve.

Preheat oven to 250°F. Sprinkle veal on both sides with salt and pepper. Top each with 1 prosciutto slice and 1 sage leaf.
Melt 1 1/2 tablespoons butter in heavy large skillet over high heat until foaming. Working in batches and adding more butter as needed (reserving 1 tablespoon), cook veal in single layer, prosciutto side down, until brown, about 1 minute. Using spatula, carefully turn veal over, keeping sage leaf intact. Cook until brown, about 1 minute longer. Transfer to rimmed baking sheet; keep warm in oven.
Add wine to pan drippings in skillet; cook over high heat until liquid is reduced by 1/3, scraping up browned bits, about 2 minutes. Add any juices from baking sheet. Swirl in remaining 1 tablespoon butter. Transfer veal to platter, pour sauce over, and serve.

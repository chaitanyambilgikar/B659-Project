Assemble shrimp toasts: Pulse shrimp, ginger, oil, Sherry, soy sauce, and egg white in a food processor to a coarse purée. Stir together with cilantro, scallions, and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Spread on bread (a scant tablespoon each).
Make bacon-wrapped pineapple: Preheat oven to 450°F with rack in middle.
Wrap 1 piece of bacon around each pineapple chunk, then wrap scallion around outside, securing with a wooden pick. Arrange in a parchment-paper-lined 4-sided sheet pan. Bake, turning once, until bacon is crisp, 15 to 20 minutes.
Meanwhile make beef teriyaki: Stir together soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, and ginger.
Thinly slice zucchini lengthwise with slicer. Put each slice of steak on a slice of zucchini, then thread lengthwise onto a skewer. Brush with soy mixture. Arrange skewers, meat side up, on an oiled broiler pan.
When pineapple has finished cooking, preheat broiler. Broil skewers 5 to 7 inches from heat until browned, 2 to 3 minutes.
Meanwhile, fry shrimp toasts: Heat 2 inches vegetable oil to 360° in a 4-quart saucepan over medium-high heat.
Fry 8 bread rounds, shrimp sides down, until browned, about 1 minute. Turn and fry until golden, about 30 seconds. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Fry remaining rounds.
To serve: Arrange skewers, bacon-wrapped pineapple, and shrimp toasts on a platter.

Toss onion, tomatoes, bell pepper, and chile with oil in a shallow (1-inch) baking pan and arrange vegetables, cut sides down, in 1 layer. Roast, turning onion once or twice, until vegetables are charred and tender, 15 to 20 minutes.
Discard skins from tomatoes and bell pepper. Chop tomatoes and drain in a sieve, discarding juices. Finely chop onion and bell pepper. Mince chile.
Mince garlic and mash to a paste with kosher salt. Blend together mayonnaise, garlic paste, and black pepper in a food processor. Add chile, about one fourth at a time, tasting for desired heat. Transfer to a bowl and stir in tomatoes, bell pepper, onion, and vinegar.

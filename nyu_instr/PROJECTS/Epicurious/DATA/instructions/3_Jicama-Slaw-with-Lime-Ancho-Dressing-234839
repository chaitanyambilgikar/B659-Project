Make the dressing: Whisk together the lime juice, vinegar, ancho powder, and honey in a bowl. Whisk in the oil and season to taste with salt and pepper. (The dressing can be made a day in advance, covered, and kept refrigerated. Bring to room temperature before using.)
Make the slaw: Combine the jicama, cabbage, and carrots in a large bowl. Pour the dressing over the jicama mixture and toss to coat well. Mix in the cilantro. Let sit at room temperature for 15 minutes before serving.

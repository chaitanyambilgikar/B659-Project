Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat) or preheat broiler. Whisk olive oil in top of double boiler over simmering water until heated through. Gradually whisk in fresh lemon juice, then 2 tablespoons hot water. Add chopped fresh parsley, chopped garlic and oregano and cook sauce 5 minutes to blend flavors, whisking frequently. Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper. Remove sauce from over simmering water.
Lightly brush swordfish on both sides with sauce. Season fish with salt and pepper. Grill or broil until just cooked through, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer fish to platter. Spoon remaining sauce over and serve.

1. Make a paste of the garlic and salt in a mortar and pestle, by working the pestle around slowly, always in the same direction, in the mortar. If you don't have a mortar and pestle, either finely mince the garlic with the salt, transfer it to a medium-sized bowl and press on it with a wooden spoon until it makes a rough paste, or simply mince the garlic and salt together in a food processor.
2. If you used a food processor to mince the garlic and salt together, transfer the mixture to a medium-sized bowl. Whisk in the mustard, then the egg yolks until blended with the garlic and salt then, using either the mortar or a whisk, add 1/4 cup (60ml) of the oil very slowly in a fine, fine stream, until the mixture becomes thick. Don't add the oil too quickly or the mixture will not emulsify.
3. Add the lemon juice and the water to the olive oil and garlic mixture, then add the remaining oil very, very slowly, whisking or turning the pestle constantly. The aïoli will gradually thicken to the consistency of a light mayonnaise. If it becomes very thick, like a commercial mayonnaise, add additional warm water, a teaspoon at a time, until it is the consistency you like. Generally, however, you shouldn't need to add any additional water.
4. Taste for seasoning, and adjust with salt if necessary. Aïoli will keep for several days in the refrigerator, in an airtight container, but it is best served within 24 hours of being made.

1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Mince the garlic with the salt; place in a bowl. Add the tangerine juice and peel, 1 tablespoon olive oil, dried tarragon, and pepper. Set aside.
2. Blanch the carrots and potatoes for 7 to 8 minutes in boiling water. Drain and place in a bowl with the tomatoes. Reserve.
3. Carefully loosen breast skin of the pheasant; place a sprig of tarragon underneath each side of the breast. Replace the skin neatly. Squeeze the halved tangerine into the cavity, then sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place the apple pieces, shallots, and sage in the cavity; tie legs together with kitchen string.
4. Place reserved vegetables in a small roasting pan. Toss with garlic-tangerine mixture. Place the pheasant, breast side up, on top of the vegetables. Brush pheasant with the remaining tablespoon of oil. Lay bacon slices over the breast. Pour broth in the bottom of the pan.
5. Roast in the center of the oven for 1 hour, basting 2 or 3 times. Remove bacon and continue to roast until the breast is brown and the pheasant is cooked through, about 20 to 30 minutes longer. Test for doneness with tip of a knife in the thickest part of the thigh. The juices should run clear. Let pheasant rest 10 minutes before carving.
6. Carve the pheasant, remove to a serving platter and surround with the vegetables. Spoon some of the juices over top. Serve extra juices alongside. Garnish with fresh sage.

Mix flour, walnuts, baking powder, and 1/8 teaspoon salt in medium bowl. Using electric mixer, beat butter, powdered sugar, and vanilla in large bowl until fluffy. Beat in egg yolk. Add flour mixture and stir until blended. Shape dough into ball; flatten into disk. Wrap in plastic and chill until firm enough to roll, about 15 minutes.
Preheat oven to 325°F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Roll out dough on lightly floured surface to 1/4-inch thickness. Using assorted cutters, cut out cookies. Transfer cookies to prepared sheets. Gather dough scraps and repeat until all dough is used. Sprinkle cookies with raw sugar, pressing lightly to adhere.
Bake sablés until light golden, about 20 minutes. Cool on sheets 5 minutes. Transfer to racks and cool completely. (Can be made 4 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.)

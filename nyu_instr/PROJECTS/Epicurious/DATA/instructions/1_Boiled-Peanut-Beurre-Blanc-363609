Stir together the shallots, vinegar, and wine in a medium saucepan. Toss in the herb bouquet and peppercorns. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and cook until the mixture reduces by half. Reduce the heat to low. Discard the bouquet and peppercorns.
Slowly add the butter, one cube at a time, madly whisking all the time, until all of the butter has been incorporated. Whisk in the gremolata and boiled peanuts. Season with salt and pepper. Serve at once or keep the sauce warm in a bain-marie (fancy French for hot-water bath).

Bring first 5 ingredients to boil in heavy large pot or Dutch oven over high heat. Mix in rice and thyme. Return soup to boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer soup uncovered until rice is tender, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes. Add chicken and simmer until heated through, thinning with additional broth if desired. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer soup to large bowl. Garnish with parsley and serve.

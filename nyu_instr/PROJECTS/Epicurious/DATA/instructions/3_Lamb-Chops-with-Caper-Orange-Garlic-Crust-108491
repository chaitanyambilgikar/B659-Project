Stir together capers, zest, garlic, and 1 tablespoon oil in a small bowl. Pat chops dry and season with salt. Arrange chops on a plate and spread about 2 teaspoons of caper mixture on top of each chop, pressing lightly to help adhere.
Heat remaining tablespoon oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderate heat until hot but not smoking, then cook chops, coated sides down, 6 minutes. Turn chops over with tongs and cook about 10 minutes more for medium-rare. Transfer chops, coated sides up, to a clean plate and let stand 5 minutes.

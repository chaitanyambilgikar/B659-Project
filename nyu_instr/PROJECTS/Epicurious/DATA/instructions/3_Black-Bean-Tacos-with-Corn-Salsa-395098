Heat oven to 400°F. Coat a baking sheet with cooking spray. In a food processor, chop garlic. Add beans, oats, cornmeal, chili powder, 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper; process, stopping once or twice to scrape down sides, until mixture is combined, 1 minute. Crumble bean mixture with hands, sprinkle on prepared sheet, and coat with cooking spray. Bake until firm and crisp on bottom, 10 to 15 minutes. Use a spoon to break up pieces, coat with cooking spray, and bake until crisp all over, 10 to 15 minutes. Stack tortillas and wrap in foil; warm in oven 5 minutes. In a bowl, combine corn, bell pepper, chile, scallions and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper; sprinkle with lime juice. Divide bean crumble among tortillas; top with corn salsa and cilantro.

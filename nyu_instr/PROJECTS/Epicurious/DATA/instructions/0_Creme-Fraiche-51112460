In a small bowl, whisk together the cream and buttermilk and cover with cheesecloth. Let the mixture stand at room temperature for 48 hours. Discard the cheesecloth and remove the skin that has formed on top of the cream, discarding it as well.
The crème fraîche will keep, in a covered container in your refrigerator, for up to 2 weeks.

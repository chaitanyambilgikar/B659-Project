Combine bananas and condensed milk in large bowl. Whisk in cream. Pour banana mixture into 8 x 8 x 2-inch glass baking dish. Cover and freeze until softly set, stirring occasionally, about 2 hours. Transfer to large bowl. Using electric mixer, beat ice cream just until fluffy. Return to same glass dish. Cover and freeze until firm, about 6 hours. (Can be made 3 days ahead. Keep frozen.)

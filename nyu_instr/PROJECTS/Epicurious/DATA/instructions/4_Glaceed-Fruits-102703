Line large baking sheet with foil. Wipe fruits clean. Insert 1 skewer halfway into each fruit (excluding grape clusters).
Combine sugar and water in heavy medium 4-inch-deep saucepan. Stir over medium-low heat until sugar dissolves. Add corn syrup and ginger. Increase heat and bring to boil, occasionally brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush. Attach candy thermometer to saucepan. Boil without stirring until syrup is golden amber color and candy thermometer registers 340°F, swirling pan occasionally, about 20 minutes. Remove pan from heat.
Holding skewer, carefully dip 1 fruit into hot caramel, coating completely. Hold fruit over pan, allowing some of excess caramel to drip off. Place fruit, still on skewer, on foil-lined sheet. Repeat dipping with remaining fruits and caramel. Hook stem end of each grape cluster in tines of fork; dip into caramel to coat. Place on prepared sheet. If necessary, carefully tilt pan to submerge fruits in caramel. (Can be prepared ahead. Cranberries, strawberries and orange segments can stand at room temperature up to 6 hours. Kumquats, dried apricots and grape clusters can be refrigerated uncovered overnight.)

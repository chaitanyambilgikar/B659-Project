In a food processor blend sesame oil, soy sauce, cornstarch, egg white, scallions, garlic, gingerroot, and salt. Add shrimp and pulse until mixture is like paste but not completely smooth.
Divide mixture among bread slices, spreading it evenly to edges, and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Cut each bread slice into 4 triangles.
In a 6-quart heavy saucepan heat 1 1/2 inches oil to 350°F. on a deep-fat thermometer and fry shrimp toasts in batches, coated sides down first, about 1 minute on each side, or until golden. Transfer shrimp toasts with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain and serve warm.

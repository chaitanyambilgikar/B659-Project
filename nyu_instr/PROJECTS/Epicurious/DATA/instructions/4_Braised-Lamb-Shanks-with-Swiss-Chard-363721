Preheat oven to 325°F. Whisk flour, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1 teaspoon cardamom, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper in pie dish to blend. Working with 1 lamb shank at a time, coat shanks in seasoned flour. Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add 3 lamb shanks. Sauté until brown, turning occasionally, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer lamb to large roasting pan. Repeat with remaining 3 lamb shanks.
Add half of green onions to same skillet. Reduce heat to low; stir 2 minutes. Add garlic; stir 30 seconds. Add tomatoes with juice, broth, raisins, tomato paste, remaining 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 3/4 teaspoon cardamom, saffron, and cloves. Increase heat and bring to boil, scraping up browned bits. Pour broth mixture over lamb.
Cover roasting pan with foil; place in oven. Braise lamb until tender, turning every 30 minutes, about 2 1/2 hours. Transfer lamb to large rimmed baking sheet. Set pan aside.
Meanwhile, cut center rib (including stem portion) from each chard leaf. Cut chard ribs crosswise into 1/2-inch-wide pieces. Stack several leaf halves at a time and cut crosswise into 1-inch-wide strips.
Tilt roasting pan and spoon off all fat from top of sauce that pools at lower end. Set roasting pan over 2 burners. Add chard ribs and remaining green onions and bring to boil over medium-high heat. Return lamb to roasting pan. Cover and return to oven. Braise until chard ribs are tender, about 20 minutes. Uncover; mix chard leaves into pan juices. Return pan to oven and roast uncovered until chard softens, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.
Transfer lamb to rimmed platter. Season chard mixture in pan to taste with salt and pepper. Spoon chard mixture over lamb. Sprinkle with parsley; serve with bulgur.

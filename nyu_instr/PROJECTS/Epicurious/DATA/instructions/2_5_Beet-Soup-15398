Boil the beets until tender. Cool them to room temperature and peel. Chop the beets roughly and place them in a blender with the broth, lemon juice, and onion. Blend on a high setting until well puréed. Add herb salt to taste and a pinch of sugar, if desired. This soup can be served cold or hot. Top with a dollop of yogurt in each bowl before serving.

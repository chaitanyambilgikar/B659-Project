Fill a 6-quart kettle three fourths full with salted water and bring to a boil for pasta.
In a deep 12-inch skillet heat butter and cream over moderately low heat until butter is melted. Stir in zest, lemon juice, and pepper to taste. Remove skillet from heat and cover to keep sauce warm.
Cook pasta in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until al dente. Ladle 1/4 cup pasta water into sauce and drain pasta in a colander. Add pasta, roe, dill, and salt to taste to sauce and cook over moderate heat, tossing, a minute, or until just heated through.

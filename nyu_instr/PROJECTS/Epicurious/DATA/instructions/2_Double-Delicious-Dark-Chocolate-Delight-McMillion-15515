Make crust: Break wafers into a food processor and finely grind. Melt butter and with motor running add to crumbs, blending until combined well. Divide crumb mixture between two 9-inch (4-cup) pie plates, pressing it evenly onto bottom and up sides of pie plates.
Make filling: Chop chocolate and in a double boiler or a metal bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water melt chocolate, stirring until smooth. Remove top of double boiler or bowl from heat and let chocolate cool to room temperature, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes.
In a bowl with an electric mixer beat whites until they just hold stiff peaks. In another bowl with mixer beat cream with vanilla until it just holds stiff peaks. Fold chocolate into cream gently but thoroughly and fold in whites gently but thoroughly. Divide mousse between shells, smoothing tops. Chill pies, covered, at least 3 hours and up to 2 days.
Make topping just before serving: In a bowl beat cream with vanilla until it just holds stiff peaks and divide between pies, spreading it decoratively over top. Sprinkle each pie with cinnamon to taste.
Garnish pies with chocolate shavings.

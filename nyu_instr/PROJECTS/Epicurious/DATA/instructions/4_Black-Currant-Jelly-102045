Rinse and drain currants and put in a large preserving kettle. Crush fruit, add water and cook slowly for 15 minutes. Force through a sieve or food mill to remove seeds. Pour the juices into a jelly bag and let drip overnight. (If you do not have a jelly bag, line a colander with 4 thicknesses of cheesecloth and set over a bowl.) The next day, measure the juices in a bowl, pour into a large pot, add an equal quantity of sugar and bring to a boil, stirring constantly until the sugar is dissolved. Cook over a high heat for 2 or 3 minutes, until a thermometer registers 220° or the juice sheets from the side of a spoon (i.e., when the last two drops on the spoon run together). Pour into hot, sterilized jelly glasses and cover with a thin layer of melted paraffin. When the paraffin has hardened, cover the glasses and store.

Preheat oven to 425°F. Unfold crust on work surface. Using wet fingertips, press together any cracks to seal. Spread flour over. Place crust, floured side down, in 9-inch tart pan with removable bottom. Fold edge in; press firmly, forming double-thick sides. Pierce crust bottom all over with fork. Bake until pale golden, about 10 minutes. Set aside. Reduce oven temperature to 400°F.
Melt 2 tablespoons butter in heavy medium skillet over medium heat. Add leeks and parsley; sauté until beginning to soften, about 3 minutes. Spoon mixture into crust. Cook bacon in same skillet until crisp. Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towels and drain. Sprinkle bacon over leeks. Beat eggs, cream, milk, salt, pepper and nutmeg in small bowl to blend; pour into crust.
Bake pie until filling is set in center, about 25 minutes. Remove pan sides. Transfer pie to platter and serve.

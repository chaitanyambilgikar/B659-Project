Put carrots, water, and salt and pepper to taste in an 8-inch skillet, then cover with a round of buttered parchment paper (buttered side down; parchment should be touching carrots) and simmer until carrots are crisp-tender, about 2 minutes. Remove parchment. Add snap peas and increase heat to high, then cook until peas are crisp-tender and liquid is reduced to about 1 teaspoon, about 1 1/2 minutes. Add orange juice, sugar, and butter, swirling skillet to coat carrots and peas, and cook until liquid is reduced to a syrupy glaze, about 30 seconds. Season with salt and pepper.

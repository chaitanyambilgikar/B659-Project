In a bowl whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt. In another bowl with an electric mixer beat together butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add flour mixture, sour cream, and egg and beat until a dough forms. Stir in coconut, apricots, and cranberries.
Halve dough and on a sheet of wax paper form each half into a 10-inch log, using paper as a guide. Chill logs, wrapped in wax paper, 4 hours, or until firm.
(After the dough has been formed into a log it can be kept in the refrigerator for one week or the freezer for one month. Thaw the frozen dough in the refrigerator until sliceable, about four hours.)
Preheat oven to 350° F. and lightly butter 3 baking sheets.
Cut logs into 1/3-inch-thick rounds with a serrated knife and arrange about 2 inches apart on baking sheets. Bake cookies in batches in middle of oven until pale golden, about 12 minutes, and transfer to racks to cool. The baked cookies keep in airtight containers at room temperature for four days.

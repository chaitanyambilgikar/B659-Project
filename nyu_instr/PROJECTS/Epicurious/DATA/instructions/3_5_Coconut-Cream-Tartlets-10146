Make shells: On a lightly floured surface with a floured rolling pin roll out half of dough into a 14-inch round, about 1/8 inch thick, and cut out four 7-inch rounds. Fit rounds into four 4-inch tart pans with removable fluted rims. Roll rolling pin over dough to trim and press dough lightly to extend it slightly above edges of pans. Make 4 more shells in same manner with remaining dough. Prick shells with a fork and chill, covered, on a baking sheet 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 400°F.
Line shells with wax paper and weight them with rice or pie weights. Bake shells on baking sheet in middle of oven for 10 minutes. Remove paper and rice carefully and bake shell until pale golden, about 5 minutes more. Cool shells in pans on a rack. Shells may be made 1 day ahead and kept in airtight containers at room temperature.
Make custard: In a heavy saucepan stir together sugar, cornstarch, and salt. Add milk gradually, stirring, and bring to a boil, whisking. In a bowl whisk together whole eggs and egg yolks. Gradually whisk about 1 cup hot milk mixture into eggs and whisk egg mixture into milk mixture. Simmer custard, whisking, 2 minutes. Remove pan from heat and whisk in vanilla and butter until butter is melted. Chill custard, its surface covered with plastic wrap, until cold.
Stir 1 cup coconut into custard and divide among pastry shells.
In a bowl beat cream until it holds soft peaks. Gradually beat in sugar and beat cream until it just holds stiff peaks. Divide whipped cream among tartlets and spread evenly. Sprinkle remaining 1/2 cup coconut over tartlets.

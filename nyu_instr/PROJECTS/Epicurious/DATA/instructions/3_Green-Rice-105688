Purée chiles, onion, garlic, parsley, cilantro, and 1/2 cup broth in a blender until smooth as possible.
Cook rice in oil in a 4-quart heavy saucepan over moderately high heat, stirring, until pale golden, about 2 minutes. Add purée and cook over moderate heat, stirring, until liquid is evaporated, 2 to 4 minutes. Add salt and remaining 2 1/4 cups broth, then simmer, uncovered until steam holes appear in rice, 10 to 12 minutes.
Cover pan and cook over very low heat until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, 10 minutes, then fluff with a fork.

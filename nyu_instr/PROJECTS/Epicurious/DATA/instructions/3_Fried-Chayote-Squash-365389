Heat the butter and oil in a large skillet over medium heat, until the butter is melted. Add the onions and sauté until they are golden, but not browned, about 8 to 10 minutes. Add the chayote and oregano and sauté an additional 2 or 3 minutes, until the squash starts to soften. Lower the heat, cover, and let cook until the chayote is tender, an additional 10 minutes.
Remove from the heat. Add the salt and pepper and toss before serving.

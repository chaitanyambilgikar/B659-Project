Halve garlic cloves. In a 12-inch skillet heat oil with garlic over moderate heat until hot but not smoking and cook bread, stirring, until golden, about 5 minutes. With a slotted spoon transfer croutons to paper towels to drain and discard garlic. Season croutons with salt. Croutons keep in an airtight container at room temperature 1 week.

Heat 2 tablespoons oil in wok or heavy large skillet over high heat. Add onions and cook until tender, stirring frequently, about 10 minutes. Add garlic and ginger and continue cooking until onions are golden brown, about 5 minutes. Add chicken and celery and cook until chicken is cooked through, stirring occasionally, about 7 minutes. Transfer mixture to platter. Set aside.
Add remaining teaspoon oil to wok. Add flour and stir over medium-high heat until just beginning to color, about 1 minute. Mix in broth, Sherry, soy sauce and mustard. Boil until slightly thickened, stirring frequently, about 5 minutes. Return chicken mixture to wok. Mix in cashews. Cook until chicken is heated through, about 3 minutes. Transfer to platter. Garnish with green onions and serve with rice.

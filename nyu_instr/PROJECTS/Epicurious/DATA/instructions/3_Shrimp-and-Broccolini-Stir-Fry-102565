Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large nonstick skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then cook shrimp until golden and almost cooked through, about 1 minute on each side. Transfer shrimp to a dish. Heat remaining tablespoon oil in skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then sauté ginger and garlic, stirring, until golden. Add Broccolini, water, hoisin, soy sauce, and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring occasionally, until Broccolini is just tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in shrimp and cook until just heated through.

For filling: Preheat oven to 375°F. Combine peaches, sugar, lemon juice and cinnamon in large bowl; toss to blend well. Transfer filling to 8x8x2-inch glass baking dish.
for topping: Sift flour, 3 tablespoons sugar, baking powder and salt into large bowl. Whisk cream, egg and vanilla in small bowl to blend. Add cream mixture to flour mixture, stirring until very soft dough forms. Using 1/4-cup measure, drop dough atop filling in 9 mounds, spacing apart. Brush mounds with melted butter. Blend remaining 1 tablespoon sugar with cinnamon in small cup; sprinkle over mounds.
Bake dessert until filling bubbles and topping is golden brown, about 50 minutes. Cool 15 minutes. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream.

In a 12-inch heavy skillet sauté garlic in oil over moderately high heat, stirring just until fragrant. Add scallions, zucchini, pattypan squash, corn, and salt and pepper to taste and sauté, stirring occasionally, until zucchini and squash are golden in spots, about 4 minutes.
Add broth and simmer ragout, covered, 3 minutes, or until squash is just tender. Add tomatoes and tarragon and simmer, covered, 1 minute, or until tomatoes are softened.
Season ragout with salt and pepper and serve warm or at room temperature.

Prepare a medium grill or preheat the broiler. If using the broiler, line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil.
In a small bowl, combine the brown sugar, house seasoning, Cajun seasoning, and cayenne pepper. Rub the steaks with the mixture.
Place the steaks on the grill or, if broiling, place on the prepared baking sheet. Grill or broil,4 inches from the heat, turning once, to desired doneness, 12 minutes for medium-rare, up to 14 minutes for medium.

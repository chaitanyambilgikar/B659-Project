Mix together beef, butter, green onions, salt and pepper. Form into 4 cakes and broil.
Serve each hamburger cake topped with a hot soft-fried egg.
For accompaniments, have plain boiled potatoes liberally dressed with butter and chopped parsley, tomatoes broiled with a seasoning of chopped garlic and basil, and plenty of cold ale. A fitting dessert would be fresh strawberries flavored with orange juice, port wine and Grand Marnier and folded into whipped cream at the last moment. Serve black Italia coffee at the end of this hearty meal.

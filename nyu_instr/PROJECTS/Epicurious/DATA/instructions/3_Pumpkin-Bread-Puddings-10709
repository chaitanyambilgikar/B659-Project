In a bowl whisk together the brown sugar, the cinnamon, the nutmeg, the cream, the milk, the pumpkin purée, the raisins, the egg, the vanilla, and a pinch of salt until the mixture is smooth, stir in the bread cubes, and let the mixture stand for 5 minutes. Divide the mixture between 2 buttered 1-cup microwave-safe ramekins fitted with wax-paper collars extending 2 inches above the rim, microwave the puddings at high power (100%), switching positions once, for 15 to 17 minutes, or until a tester comes out clean, and let them stand for 3 minutes. Discard the paper collars and serve the puddings warm.

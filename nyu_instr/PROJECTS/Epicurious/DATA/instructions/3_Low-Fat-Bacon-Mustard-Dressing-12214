In a small heavy skillet cook bacon over moderate heat, stirring, until crisp and remove skillet from heat. Add orange juice to skillet and scrape up brown bits. In a blender blend bacon mixture, remaining ingredients, and salt and pepper to taste until smooth. Dressing keeps, covered and chilled, 1 week. Serve dressing with crisp lettuce, sliced tomatoes, or potato salad.

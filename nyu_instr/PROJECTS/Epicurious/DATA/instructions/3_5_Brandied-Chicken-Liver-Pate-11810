In a large heavy skillet cook onion and garlic in butter over moderate heat, stirring, until softened. Pat dry chicken livers and season with salt and pepper. Add livers to onion mixture and cook, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but barely pink inside, about 10 minutes. Add brandy and simmer 2 minutes. Transfer hot mixture to a food processor and add nutmeg, allspice, and salt and pepper to taste. Purée mixture until very smooth and cool mixture.
While pâté is cooling, in a bowl cover currants with boiling water and soak 5 minutes. Drain currants and pat dry between paper towels.
Transfer pâté to bowl and stir in currants. Pack pâté in a crock (or crocks). Chill pâté, its surface covered with plastic wrap, at least 6 hours and up to 3 days. Bring pâté to room temperature before serving.
Serve pâté with toasts or crackers.

To make pancakes: In a bowl whisk together the buttermilk, the eggs, and 6 tablespoons of the butter. In a large bowl whisk together the flours, the wheat germ, the salt, the baking powder, the baking soda, and the sugar, add the buttermilk mixture, and whisk the batter until it is just combined. Heat a griddle over moderately high heat until it is hot enough to make drops of water scatter over its surface and brush it with some of the additional melted butter. Working in batches, pour the batter onto the griddle by 1/3-cup measures, sprinkle each pancake with about 2 tablespoons of the blueberries , and cook the pancakes for 2 minutes on each side, or until they are golden. Transfer the pancakes as they are cooked to a heatproof platter and keep them warm in a preheated 200°F. oven. Serve the pancakes with the syrup.
To make blueberry or maple syrup: In a large saucepan combine the blueberries and 1 1/2 cups water, bring the mixture to a boil, and simmer it, covered, for 10 minutes. Purée the mixture in batches in a blender or food processor and force it through a fine sieve into a bowl, discarding the solids. In the pan, cleaned, combine the sugar, the zest, and 3 cups water, bring the mixture to a boil, stirring until the sugar is dissolved, and boil it, uncovered, until a candy thermometer registers 200°F. Discard the zest, add the blueberry mixture, and boil the syrup, stirring, for 1 minute. Let the syrup cool, skim off any froth, and stir in the lemon juice. Pour the syrup into glass jars with tight-fitting lids. The syrup keeps, covered and chilled, for 3 months. Serve the syrup warm over pancakes or ice cream. Makes about 6 cups.

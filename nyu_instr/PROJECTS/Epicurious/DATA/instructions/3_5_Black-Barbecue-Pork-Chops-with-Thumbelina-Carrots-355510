Make barbecue sauce: Heat butter and olive oil in a 4-to 5-quart pot over medium-low heat until foam subsides. Cook onion, chopped garlic, jalapeño, and raisins, covered, stirring occasionally, until onion begins to brown, 7 to 9 minutes.
Add bourbon (use caution; alcohol may ignite) and boil, scraping up any brown bits, until most of liquid has evaporated, about 2 minutes. Stir in coffee, then boil until most of liquid has evaporated, 3 to 5 minutes. Repeat with cola.
Add ketchup, soy sauce, vinegar, molasses, Worcestershire sauce, black bean paste, and chocolate and simmer, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes.
Add spices and 1 teaspoon pepper and simmer over low heat, stirring occasionally, until very thick, about 10 minutes.
Remove from heat and cool 15 minutes. Purée sauce in a blender with remaining 2 garlic cloves, lime juice, and sesame oil until smooth and thick.
Cook pork chops: Rub 6 tablespoons sauce all over pork chops and marinate, chilled, in a large shallow baking dish at least 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 350°F with rack in middle.
Rub off excess marinade from chops with a paper towel. Heat oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers, then brown chops in 2 batches, turning once, about 2 minutes total.
Transfer to a 4-sided sheet pan (reserve skillet) and roast chops in oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted into center of chops registers 148 to 150ºF for juicy pink meat, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest while cooking carrots.
Make carrots while pork rests: Melt butter in reserved skillet over medium heat, then cook carrots, stirring occasionally, 2 minutes. Add vermouth and lemon juice and cook, covered, 2 minutes. Uncover and simmer until most of liquid has evaporated and carrots are tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Season with kosher salt and pepper. Halve carrots lengthwise, then return to pan and keep warm.
Serve pork chops with carrots and remaining sauce on the side.

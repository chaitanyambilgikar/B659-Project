Preheat oven to 375°F. Blend flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt in processor. Using on/off turns, cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add cheese and cut in using on/off turns. Whisk cream and egg in small bowl. With machine running, add cream mixture through feed tube. Process just until dough begins to clump together (do not overmix).
Turn dough out onto lightly floured work surface. Gather dough together; divide in half. Pat each half into 6-inch round. Cut each round into 6 wedges. Transfer to ungreased baking sheet, spacing 2 inches apart.
Bake scones until golden and tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Transfer scones to rack and cool at least 10 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature. (Can be made 8 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature. If desired, rewarm in 350°F oven about 5 minutes.)

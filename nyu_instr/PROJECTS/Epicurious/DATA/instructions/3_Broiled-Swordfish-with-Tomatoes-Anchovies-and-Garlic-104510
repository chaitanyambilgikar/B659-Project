1. Cut the swordfish into ten 3 1/2 ounce portions. Refrigerate until needed.
2. Sweat the shallots and garlic in the wine until the shallots are translucent. Remove from the heat and stir in the tomatoes and anchovies.
3. For each serving : Brush 1 portion of swordfish with 1/4 teaspoon of the oil and broil until golden brown and cooked through, about 6 minutes.
4. While the swordfish is broiling, heat 3 ounces of the tomato mixture in a small saute pan. Remove from the heat and add about 1/2 teaspoon of the basil. Toss to combine. Serve with the swordfish.
Any firm-fleshed fish suitable for broiling, such as halibut or tuna, may be substituted for the swordfish.

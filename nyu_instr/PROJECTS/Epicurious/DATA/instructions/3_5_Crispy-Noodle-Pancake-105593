Cook noodles in large pot of boiling water 1 1/2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Drain. Rinse with cold water. Drain well. Toss with green onions, 1 teaspoon vegetable oil, and pepper in bowl.
Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil and sesame oil in a heavy 9-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add noodles and flatten slightly. Cook without stirring until light brown, about 6 minutes. Turn and cook second side until light brown, 6 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Cut into wedges.

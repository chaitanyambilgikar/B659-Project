Squeeze juice from 1 orange (about 1/4 cup) into small bowl. Cut ends off remaining 2 oranges to expose flesh. Cut oranges lengthwise into quarters; pull out and discard white center pith. Cut orange quarters crosswise into 1/8-inch-thick slices. Place orange slices along with any collected juices in another bowl.
Sprinkle sugar evenly over bottom of heavy 10-inch-diameter skillet; scatter butter pieces over and drizzle with 2 tablespoons orange juice. Stir over medium heat until mixture begins to melt and bubble, then swirl pan to blend. Cook until sugar mixture is dark amber, occasionally scraping down sides of skillet with heatproof spatula, about 6 minutes. Stir in 2 tablespoons orange juice and cook until smooth and thickened, about 2 minutes. Add orange slices with juices to skillet and stir until coated, about 1 minute. Cool. DO AHEAD: Caramelized orange sauce can be made up to 3 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.
Scoop ice cream into bowls and spoon caramelized orange sauce over. Top sundaes with toasted almonds and sprinkle with fleur de sel, if desired.

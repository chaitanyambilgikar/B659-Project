Mix mustard and mayonnaise in small bowl to blend. Spread mustard mixture over both cut sides of ciabatta rolls. Place 1 slice roast beef atop mustard mixture on bottom side of each roll; sprinkle with sea salt and ground black pepper. Top each with 1 tablespoon cranberry sauce, red onion slices, and watercress sprigs. Cover with roll tops and serve.

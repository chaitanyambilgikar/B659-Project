1. To make the pastry case, rub the butter into the flour with the baking powder and add enough cold water to mix to a stiff dough. Leave to rest and roll out to a fairly thin sheet. Grease 2 x 20 cm (8-inch) loaf tins and line them with the dough, reserving enough to cover the top.
2. Preaheat the oven to 110°C (225°F/ Gas 1/4).
3. Make the filling. Mix all the dry ingredients together, then mix in the brandy, egg, and enough milk to moisten the mixture. Put it into the prepared loaf tins and cover with the remaining pastry. Use the remaining milk or an egg wash (1 egg beaten with a splash of milk) to seal the top crust. Prick all over with a fork and brush with egg wash. Bake in the oven for about 3 hours. When it is cool store in an airtight tin.

Preheat oven to 375°F. Butter loaf pans and dust with flour, knocking out excess.
Stir together flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder and soda, and salt in a large bowl. Whisk together butter, eggs, and buttermilk in another bowl and add to flour mixture, stirring until just combined. Stir in raisins, cranberries, and fennel seeds.
Divide batter among pans, smoothing tops, and let stand 10 minutes. Bake in middle of oven until tops are pale golden and a tester comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool in pans on racks 10 minutes, then invert onto racks and cool completely.

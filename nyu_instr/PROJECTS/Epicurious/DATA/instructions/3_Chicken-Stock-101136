Peel and halve onions. Halve celery rib and carrots and crumble thyme. If using wings, cut each wing at joints into 3 pieces. In a stockpot or kettle (at least 6-quart) combine chicken parts with 14 cups water and bring to a boil, skimming froth. Add remaining 1/2 cup water and bring mixture to a simmer, skimming froth.
Stick 2 onion halves with 1 clove each and add to stockpot or kettle with celery, carrots, thyme, and remaining ingredients. Cook stock at a bare simmer, partially covered, skimming froth, 3 hours.
Pour stock through a fine sieve into a large heatproof bowl and discard solids. If a more concentrated flavor is desired, in a large saucepan boil stock until reduced to desired concentration. Cool stock, uncovered. Stock keeps, covered and chilled, 1 week, or frozen in an airtight container, 3 months. Remove fat before using.

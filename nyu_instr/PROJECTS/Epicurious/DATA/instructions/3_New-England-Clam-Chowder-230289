Drain clams and reserve juice. In a medium-sized skillet, cook bacon, stirring until hot, 1 to 2 minutes. Add butter and onion; cook until onion is softened. Pour in clam juice, add potatoes and cook until tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Stir in clams, half-and-half, thyme, cayenne pepper to taste, and parsley. Season with salt and pepper. Heat through. Do not boil. Serve with oyster crackers.

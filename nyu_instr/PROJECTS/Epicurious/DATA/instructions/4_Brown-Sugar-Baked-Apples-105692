Peel skin off top quarter of each apple. Using melon baller, scoop out core, leaving bottom intact. Stand apples in 13x9x2-inch baking pan. Mix sugar and spices in bowl. Reserve 2 tablespoons mixture. Fill apple cavities with remaining sugar mixture. Spoon 1/2 tablespoon maple syrup into each cavity. Scatter 3 tablespoons butter pieces over apples. (Can be made 4 hours ahead. Cover; chill.)
Preheat oven to 350°F. Pour 1/2 cup water into pan with apples. Bake apples 35 minutes. Add reserved 2 tablespoons sugar mixture, 2 tablespoons maple syrup, 1 tablespoon butter, and 1/2 cup water to pan. Bake until apples are tender when pierced with skewer, about 25 minutes longer. Transfer apples to 8 bowls. Place baking pan atop 2 burners; boil over medium-high heat until syrupy, about 2 minutes. Spoon sauce over apples. Serve with whipping cream, if desired.

Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add chorizo; sauté until fat is rendered, about 3 minutes. Add next 6 ingredients; sauté until onion begins to soften, about 5 minutes. Mix in oregano and cumin, then tomatoes, corn, and bottled clam juice. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer until potatoes are almost tender, about 12 minutes. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Refrigerate uncovered until cool, then cover and chill. Bring to simmer before continuing.)
Add clams to mixture in pot; cover and cook over medium-high heat until clams open and potatoes are tender, about 7 minutes (discard any clams that do not open). Mix in 4 tablespoons cilantro. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Divide clams among 6 shallow soup bowls. Ladle chowder over. Sprinkle with remaining cilantro and serve.
* A smoked-pork link sausage flavored with garlic and spices, but milder than Mexican chorizo. Spanish chorizo is available at Spanish markets and specialty foods stores.

Stir 1 1/2 cups water, sugar, cinnamon sticks, ginger and lemon in heavy large pot over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Bring syrup to boil; cover and simmer 10 minutes to blend flavors. Add pineapple and simmer until pineapple is just translucent, stirring occasionally, about 7 minutes. Transfer pineapple and syrup to bowl. Refrigerate until cold, at least 2 hours. (Can be prepared 2 days ahead. Cover and keep refrigerated.)

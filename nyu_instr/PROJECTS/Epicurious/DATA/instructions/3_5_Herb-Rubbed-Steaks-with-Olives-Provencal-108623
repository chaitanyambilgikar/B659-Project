Rub tenderloin steaks with 1 tablespoon olive oil; sprinkle with crushed bay leaves. Place steaks in small glass baking dish in single layer; let stand at room temperature at least 1 hour and up to 2 hours. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
Bring small saucepan of water to boil over medium-high heat. Add olives and return water to boil. Drain olives.
Scrape most of bay leaves off steaks; sprinkle steaks with salt and pepper. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add steaks and sauté to desired doneness, about 4 minutes per side for medium-rare. Transfer steaks to plate. Add white wine to skillet and bring to boil, scraping up browned bits. Add tomato puree, whole bay leaf, and drained olives to skillet. Cook until sauce is slightly thickened, stirring frequently, about 5 minutes. Return steaks and any accumulated juices to skillet; turn to coat. Cook steaks until just heated through, turning once, about 2 minutes. Transfer steaks to platter. Discard bay leaf. Spoon sauce and olives over steaks and serve.

In a heavy skillet cook the mushrooms in the oils over moderate heat, stirring frequently, for 6 to 8 minutes, or until the liquid they give off is evaporated and they are golden. Stir in 1 tablespoon water, the scallion greens, and salt and pepper to taste and cook the mixture, stirring, for 1 minute.

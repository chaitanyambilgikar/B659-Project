Preheat broiler and line rack of a broiler pan with foil.
Whisk together mustard and jam in a small bowl. Whisk together 1/3 cup mustard mixture with garlic in a large bowl.
Pat pork dry, then sprinkle all over with teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Coat pork with 2 tablespoons mustard-garlic mixture, then arrange without crowding on broiler pan.
Toss apricots and remaining 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper with remaining mustard-garlic mixture. Arrange apricots in 1 layer around pork (including space between tenderloins) and broil 5 to 6 inches from heat, turning pork over once, until thermometer inserted diagonally into center of each tenderloin registers 145°F and apricots are softened, about 15 minutes. Transfer pork to a cutting board (leave apricots on pan) and let stand 5 minutes.
Cut pork crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick slices and transfer to a platter. Spoon apricots over pork and serve remaining mustard-jam mixture on the side (sweeten with additional jam if desired).

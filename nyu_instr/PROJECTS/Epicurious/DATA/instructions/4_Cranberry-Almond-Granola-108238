Preheat oven to 325°F. Spray heavy large rimmed baking sheet with nonstick spray. Combine oats, almonds, coconut, and pecans in large bowl. Combine cranberry juice concentrate, brown sugar, oil, cinnamon, and allspice in medium saucepan. Bring to boil, whisking until sugar dissolves. Pour hot syrup over oat mixture; stir to coat evenly. Spread mixture out on prepared sheet. Bake until golden brown at edges, about 20 minutes. Add cranberries; using metal spatula, stir to blend. Bake until granola is golden and beginning to dry, stirring occasionally, about 12 minutes longer. Cool completely on baking sheet. (Store airtight at room temperature up to 1 week.)

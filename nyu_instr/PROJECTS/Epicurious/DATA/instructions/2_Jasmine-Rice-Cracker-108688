Wash rice in 3 or 4 changes of cold water in a large bowl, then drain well in a large sieve and transfer to a 2- to 3-quart heavy saucepan. Add 2 1/2 cups water and table salt and boil, uncovered, without stirring, until steam holes appear on surface of rice and grains on top appear dry, about 8 minutes. Reduce heat to as low as possible, then cover pan with a tight-fitting lid and cook 15 minutes more.
Remove pan from heat and let stand, covered, 5 minutes, then fluff rice with a fork. Transfer to a bowl and cool to warm.
Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350°F. Lightly oil a 13- by 9- by 2-inch metal baking pan.
Press rice evenly into baking pan with lightly oiled hands. Put pan in oven and reduce oven temperature to 250°F. Bake rice until dry, about 3 hours. Cool completely in pan on a rack, then break into 2- to 3-inch pieces.
Heat oil in a deep 4- to 5-quart heavy pot over moderately high heat until it registers 350°F on thermometer. Fry pieces of rice in batches of 4 to 6, turning over once, until pale golden, about 2 minutes. (Return oil to 350°F between batches.) Transfer with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain and season with fleur de sel.

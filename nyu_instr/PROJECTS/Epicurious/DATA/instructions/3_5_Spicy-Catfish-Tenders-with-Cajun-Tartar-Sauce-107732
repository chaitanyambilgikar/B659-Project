Prepare fish: Whisk together egg and hot sauce in a wide shallow dish. Stir in fish strips and let stand at room temperature at least 10 and up to 30 minutes.
Pour enough oil into a 4- to 5-quart heavy pot to measure 2 inches and heat over moderate heat until thermometer registers 350°F.
Stir together flour, cornmeal, salt, and Cajun seasoning in another wide shallow dish.
Make tartar sauce: Stir together all sauce ingredients in a bowl and chill, covered, until ready to serve.
Fry fish: Drain fish well in a colander. Dredge one fourth of fish in flour mixture, shaking off excess, then transfer to oil and fry, stirring occasionally with a slotted spoon, until golden and just cooked through, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Transfer with slotted spoon to paper towels to drain. Return oil to 350°F. Repeat procedure with remaining fish strips in 3 batches.
Serve fish tenders hot with tartar sauce and lemon wedges.

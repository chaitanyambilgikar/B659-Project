Peel potatoes and halve lengthwise, then cut lengthwise into 1/2-inch-thick wedges, transferring as cut to a large bowl of ice and cold water. Chill 30 minutes.
Heat oil in a deep 6-quart heavy pot over moderately high heat until it registers 325°F on thermometer. While oil is heating, drain potatoes and dry thoroughly with paper towels. Fry one third of potatoes, stirring gently, until edges are just golden, about 4 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to fresh paper towels to drain. Fry remaining potatoes in 2 batches, returning oil to 325°F between batches. Remove oil from heat and reserve. Cool potatoes, about 25 minutes.
Heat oil over moderately high heat until it registers 350°F. Put oven racks in upper and lower thirds of oven and preheat oven to 250°F.
Fry potatoes again, in 3 batches, until deep golden brown and crisp, about 5 minutes per batch. Return oil to 350°F between batches. Transfer with slotted spoon to fresh paper towels as fried and drain briefly, then arrange in 1 layer in a shallow baking pan and keep warm in upper third of oven.
Increase oil temperature to 375°F. Sift 1 1/2 cups flour into a bowl, then whisk in beer gently until just combined. Stir in 1/4 teaspoon salt.
Pat fish dry. Sprinkle fish on both sides with 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper, then dredge in remaining 1/2 cup flour, shaking off excess. Coat 4 pieces of fish in batter, 1 at a time, and slide into oil as coated. Fry coated fish, turning over frequently, until deep golden and cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a paper-towel-lined baking sheet and keep warm in lower third of oven, then fry remaining fish in batches of 4, returning oil to 375°F between batches.
Season fish and chips with salt.

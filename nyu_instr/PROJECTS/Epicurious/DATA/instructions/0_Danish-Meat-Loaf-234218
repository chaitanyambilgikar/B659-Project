Preheat oven to 350° F.
Soak bread in warm water for 3 or 4 minutes. Squeeze out water and tear into pieces.
Combine lightly beaten eggs, Worcestershire, salt, and pepper in small bowl. Using a big mixing bowl, mix bread and egg mixture together, then add onions, garlic, and the meats, and blend together with a wooden spoon or your hands.
Pat into an oval or square baking dish or a loaf pan, then sprinkle with bread crumbs. Bake 1 to 1 1/4 hours or until instant-read thermometer registers 155°F.
Remove from oven, pour off excess fat, and let it rest for 10 minutes.

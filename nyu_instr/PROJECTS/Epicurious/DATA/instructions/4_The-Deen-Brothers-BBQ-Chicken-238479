1. Preheat oven to 375°F or prepare a grill (brush the grill grate lightly with oil).
2. In a large bowl, stir together all ingredients except the chicken. Reserve 1/3 cup of the barbecue sauce; set aside. Add the chicken to the remaining sauce in the bowl, turning to coat.
3. Arrange the coated chicken in a roasting pan or on the grill. Cook (covered, if grilling) for 40 to 45 minutes or until cooked through, basting with the reserved 1/3 cup sauce after 20 minutes.

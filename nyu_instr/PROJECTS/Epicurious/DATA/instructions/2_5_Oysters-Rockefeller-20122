Remove oysters from shell and put in each shell 1 teaspoon of the sour cream which has been mixed with the garlic, salt and pepper. Put oyster on top and completely fill the shells with raw spinach which has been put through the meat chopper and mixed with the Pernod and cheese. Sprinkle the top with bread crumbs and a little more grated Parmesan cheese. Dot with butter, put oyster shells on a bed of rock salt in the broiling pan and brown the oysters under the broiler. Serve piping hot.

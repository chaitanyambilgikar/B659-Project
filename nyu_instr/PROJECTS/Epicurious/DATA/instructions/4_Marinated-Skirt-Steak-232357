Put all ingredients except the steak in a blender and blend until smooth.
Pour the marinade over the skirt steak in a nonreactive pan.
Break Point Marinate, refrigerated, for 3 to 4 hours before grilling, but no more than 10 hours.
When ready to cook the steaks, prepare your grill for grilling.
Remove the skirt steak from the marinade and clean away any excess marinade with the back of a knife.
Grill the steak over medium-high heat for 4 to 5 minutes per side to serve it rare to medium-rare.
When cooked, slice the steak thinly against the grain, starting at one corner and cutting on the bias. Serve either hot or at room temperature.

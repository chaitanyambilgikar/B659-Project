For ravioli: Heat oil in heavy small skillet over medium heat. Mix in shallots. Cover and cook 5 minutes. Transfer shallots to medium bowl and cool. Add all cheeses and toss to coat.
Place 2 wonton wrappers on work surface; brush with egg white. Mound 1 rounded tablespoon filling in center of 1 wrapper; cover with second wrapper, egg white side facing down. Using fingertips, press around edges and filling to seal. Repeat with remaining wrappers, egg white, and filling, forming total of 18 ravioli. Place ravioli in single layer on lightly floured baking sheet. Cover with dry towel, then plastic wrap. DO AHEAD Can be made 6 hours ahead; refrigerate.
For sauce: Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion, garlic, and jalapeño; sauté 5 minutes. Add all tomatoes, all olives, and basil. Cover and simmer 12 minutes to blend flavors. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Cook ravioli in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally, about 6 minutes.
Meanwhile, melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium heat; set aside. Using strainer, transfer ravioli to skillet with melted butter. Toss gently over medium heat to coat with butter, about 2 minutes. Spoon tomato sauce onto 6 plates. Top each with 3 ravioli and serve.

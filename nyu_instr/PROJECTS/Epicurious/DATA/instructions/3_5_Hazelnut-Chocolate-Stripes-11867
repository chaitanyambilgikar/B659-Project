In a bowl with an electric mixer cream the butter with the sugars until mixture is light and fluffy and beat in the egg and the vanilla. Into the bowl sift together 2 cups of the flour, the baking powder, and the salt, beat the dough until it is combined well, and transfer half the dough to another bowl. Into half the dough beat in the hazelnuts and the remaining 1/4 cup flour. Beat the cocoa powder into the remaining dough. On a sheet of wax paper form each dough into a 10- by 1 1/2-inch squared-off log, using the wax paper as a guide, and chill the log, wrapped in the wax paper, for 1 hour, or until they are firm. Cut each log carefully into 4 equal lengthwise slices with a knife and reassemble the logs, alternating 2 slices from each dough to form striped patterns. Chill the logs, wrapped in the wax paper, for at least 4 hours or overnight.
Preheat the oven to 350°F. Cut the logs into 3/8-inch-thick slices with a sharp knife and arrange the slices 2 inches apart on lightly buttered baking sheets. Bake the cookies in batches in the middle of the oven for 10 to 12 minutes, or until they are pale golden. Transfer the cookies to racks and let them cool completely.
To toast and skin hazelnuts: Toast the hazelnuts in one layer in a baking pan in a preheated 350°F. oven for 10 to 15 minutes, or until they are colored lightly and the skins blister. Wrap the nuts in a kitchen towel and let them steam for 1 minute. Rub the nuts in the towel to remove as much of the skins as possible and let them cool.

Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. When the oil is very hot, pat the chops dry with paper towels. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cook the chops, turning once, for about 5 minutes on each side, or until browned.
Lower the heat to medium and scatter the garlic around the chops. Cover the pan. Cook for 5 to 8 minutes more, or until the chops are just slightly pink when cut near the bone. Do not overcook, or the chops will be dry. Transfer the chops to a plate and keep warm.
Add the peppers and the 2 tablespoons liquid to the skillet. Cook, stirring, for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the peppers are just heated through. Spoon the peppers over the chops and serve immediately.

Preheat oven to 425°F. Form bed of bok choy in center of each of two 12-inch square pieces of foil. Top bok choy with fish. Mix orange juice, green onion, hoisin, ginger, and orange peel in small bowl. Spoon mixture over fish, dividing equally. Sprinkle with salt and coriander. Top with cilantro. Fold up foil sides and pinch tightly to seal above fish and at both ends of packets, enclosing contents completely. Place packets on baking sheet. Bake until fish is just opaque in center, 12 to 14 minutes. Transfer packets to plates and serve.

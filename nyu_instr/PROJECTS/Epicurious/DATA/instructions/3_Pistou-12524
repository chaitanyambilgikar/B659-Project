In a food processor purée the basil and the garlic, add the oil, the Parmesan, and salt and pepper to taste, and blend the pistou until it is smooth. Stir the pistou into soups or toss it with cooked pasta or vegetables. (The pistou may be made 1 week in advance and kept, chilled, in an airtight container.)

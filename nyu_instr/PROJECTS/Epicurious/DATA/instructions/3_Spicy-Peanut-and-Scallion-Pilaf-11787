In a small heavy saucepan cook the garlic and the red pepper flakes in the oil over moderately low heat for 1 minute, add the rice, and cook the mixture over moderate heat, stirring, for 1 minute. Stir in 1 cup water and the salt, bring the liquid to a boil, and cook the rice, covered, over low heat for 18 to 20 minutes, or until the liquid is absorbed. Fluff the rice with a fork, let it stand, covered, off the heat for 5 minutes, and stir in the peanuts, the scallion, and the lime juice.

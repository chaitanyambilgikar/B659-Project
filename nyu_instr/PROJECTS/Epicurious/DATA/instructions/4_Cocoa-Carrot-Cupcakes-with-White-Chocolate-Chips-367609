• Preheat the oven to 350°F. Place paper liners in 24 cupcake/muffin tins.
• Place the sugar, oil, and eggs in a mixer fitted with a paddle and beat until well combined. Place the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl and mix well. Add to the oil mixture, scrape down the sides of the bowl, add the carrots and chocolate chips, and mix again. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.
• Using a 2-ounce ice cream scoop or heaping tablespoon, fill the prepared tins. Transfer to the oven and bake until a tester comes out clean and the tops are slightly domed, 22 to 25 minutes. Let cool in the pan for 5 minutes, then transfer cupcakes to a wire rack and set aside to cool.

Combine scallops and wine in large skillet. Cover and simmer over medium heat until scallops are just opaque in center, about 5 minutes. Drain. Chill scallops until cold, about 2 hours. Cut scallops into 1/2-inch pieces.
Line twelve 3/4-cup soufflé dishes with plastic wrap, extending over sides by 3 inches. Whisk 1 cup fresh chives, crème fraîche, 1/2 cup tarragon, and 3 tablespoons mustard in large bowl to blend. Gently stir in scallops and cucumber. Season with salt and pepper. Cut 12 rounds from salmon slices to fit bottom of soufflé dishes; place 1 round in each dish. Top each with 1/4 cup scallop mixture. Top each with another layer of salmon, trimming to fit. Divide remaining scallop mixture among dishes (about 1/4 cup for each). Top each with a third layer of salmon, trimming to fit. Fold plastic wrap overhang over terrines to enclose completely. Chill at least 4 hours. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Keep chilled.)
Whisk oil, vinegar and 1/3 cup chives, 3 tablespoons tarragon, and 2 tablespoons mustard in medium bowl to blend. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Unfold plastic wrap atop each terrine. Invert 1 terrine onto each of 12 plates. Peel off plastic wrap from each terrine. Surround each terrine with watercress sprigs and endive leaves. Drizzle greens and terrines with vinaigrette and serve.

In a 3-quart saucepan bring 2 quarts salted water to a boil for pasta.
With a sharp knife cut peel and pith from grapefruit and oranges. Working over a bowl cut grapefruit and orange sections free from membranes, transferring sections to a plate, and halve them. Squeeze excess juice from membranes into juice in bowl and reserve 1/4 cup juice.
In a 12-inch skillet combine reserved juice, and cream and heat sauce over moderate heat until butter is just melted. Keep cream sauce warm over very low heat.
Add pasta to boiling water and cook until al dente. Drain pasta well in a colander. Add pasta, fruit, Parmesan, and parsley to sauce and toss with salt to taste until most of sauce is absorbed.

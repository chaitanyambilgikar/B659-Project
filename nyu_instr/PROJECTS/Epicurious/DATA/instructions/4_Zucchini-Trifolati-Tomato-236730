Wash the zucchini. Cut them in half lengthwise, then into rough pieces of about 3/4 inch. Tear the tomatoes in half and squeeze out some of the seeds and juice. Peel the garlic and cut into slivers. Chop the basil.
Heat 2 tbsp. olive oil in a skillet. Add the zucchini and garlic, and stir to combine. When the zucchini begins to brown, add the tomatoes, salt, and pepper. Stir well, then cook for 5 minutes.
Remove from the heat and add the basil. Drizzle with olive oil and cover. Let sit for at least 10 minutes before serving.

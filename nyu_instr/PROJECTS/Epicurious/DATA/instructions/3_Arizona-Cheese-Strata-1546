Preheat oven to 400°F. Lightly butter 9-inch-diameter glass pie plate. Whisk milk, egg, salt and pepper in medium bowl to blend. Mix in cheese, green onion and chili. Add bread and stir until moistened. Transfer mixture to prepared pie dish. Let stand until bread absorbs most of custard, pressing several times to submerge cubes, about 5 minutes.
Bake strata uncovered until light brown around edges, top is crusty and knife inserted into center comes out clean, about 20 minutes.

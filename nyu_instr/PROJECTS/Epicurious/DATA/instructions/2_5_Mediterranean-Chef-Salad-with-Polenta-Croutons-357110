Heat oven to 400°F. Halve polenta lengthwise, then halve each piece lengthwise. Slice crosswise 7 times (to yield 32 triangles). Coat a small baking sheet with cooking spray; evenly arrange triangles; coat tops with cooking spray. Place tomatoes on a small rimmed baking sheet; spray with oil and toss. Place both sheets in oven for 10 minutes; remove tomatoes from oven and stir. Return to oven and cook until croutons are toasted on 1 side and tomatoes are wrinkled and brown in spots, about 20 minutes more. Remove tomatoes. Flip croutons; return to oven for 20 minutes more. Pour vinegar over tomatoes; transfer to a bowl. Mix in beans, salt, pepper and pepper flakes; set aside. Divide romaine and basil among 4 plates. Pour tomato mixture over greens; top with croutons and cheese.

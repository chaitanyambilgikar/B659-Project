1. Combine the butter, garlic, and parsley in a small bowl.
2. Shortly before serving, preheat the oven to 350°F. Cut the bread into 1-inch slices without cutting all the way through. Spread the butter into each slice. Wrap the bread in aluminum foil, gathering it loosely over the top.
3. Heat bread in the oven for about 20 minutes for the butter to melt. Serve in a basket, wrapped in a napkin.

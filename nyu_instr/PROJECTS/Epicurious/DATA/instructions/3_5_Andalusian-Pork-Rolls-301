Mix parsley and garlic in small bowl. Place pork between 2 sheets of waxed paper. Using mallet, pound pork to 1/4-inch thickness. Cut each pork cutlet into 5x3-inch rectangle. Top each with 1 ham slice. Sprinkle with parsley mixture. Starting at short end, roll up each cutlet; secure with toothpicks. Dip into egg mixture, then coat with bread crumbs.
Pour oil into deep medium skillet to depth of 1 inch and heat to 375°F. Add pork rolls and fry until golden and cooked through, about 13 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Cut rolls crosswise into 3/4-inch-wide slices.

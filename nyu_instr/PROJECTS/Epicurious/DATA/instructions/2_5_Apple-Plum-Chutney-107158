Combine 1 cup water and sugar in heavy large saucepan over high heat. Bring to boil, stirring until sugar dissolves. Add vinegar, ginger, garlic, half of plums, and apple. Boil 5 minutes. Add remaining plums, orange peel, and cinnamon. Bring to gentle boil; cook until syrupy, stirring occasionally, about 12 minutes. Cool to room temperature. (Can be made 3 days ahead. Cover and chill. Bring to room temperature before serving.)

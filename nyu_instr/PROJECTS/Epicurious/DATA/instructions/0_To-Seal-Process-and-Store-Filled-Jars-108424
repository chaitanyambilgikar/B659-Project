Wipe off rims of filled jars with a clean damp kitchen towel, then firmly screw on lids with screw bands.
Put sealed jars on a rack in a boiling-water canner or a deep 8- to 10-quart pot and add enough water to cover by 2 inches. Bring to a boil, covered. Boil jars of marmalade 10 minutes, then transfer with tongs to a towel-lined surface to cool. Jars will seal (if you hear a ping, that signals that the vacuum formed at the top has made the lid concave) and marmalade will thicken as it cools.
After jars have cooled 12 to 24 hours, press center of each lid to check that it's concave, then remove screw band and try to lift lid with your fingertips. If you can't, the lid has a good seal.
Store in a cool dry place.

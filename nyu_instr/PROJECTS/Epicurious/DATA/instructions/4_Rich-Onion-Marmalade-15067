Melt the butter in a large, heavy skillet over medium heat. Add the onions, stir so they are coated with butter, and reduce the heat to medium-low. Cover the skillet and cook, stirring occasionally to be sure the onions aren't sticking, until they are reduced in volume by two-thirds and are a pale gold color, 1-1/2 hours. Continue cooking, stirring often, until they melt by another one third and turn a deeper golden, 10 to 15 minutes.
Remove the skillet from the heat, season the onions with salt, and pepper if desired, and let cool. Serve alongside roasted meats or fish, as a topping for pizza or a filling for savory tart.

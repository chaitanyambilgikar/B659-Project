Lay peppers on their sides on racks of gas burners and turn flames on moderately high. Roast, turning frequently with tongs, until skins are blackened, 5 to 8 minutes. (Or broil on rack of a broiler pan about 4 inches from heat, turning frequently, 15 to 20 minutes.)
Transfer to a bowl, then cover and let steam 10 minutes. Peel peppers and discard stems and seeds. Cut lengthwise into 1-inch-wide strips.
Whisk together remaining ingredients in a bowl and add peppers, tossing to coat. Marinate at room temperature, tossing occasionally, at least 1 hour.

Place 1/2 cup sugar, nuts, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in processor. Using on/off turns, process until nuts are finely ground. Add butter in 4 additions, processing to blend after each addition. Add almond extract; process to blend. Add flour and cinnamon. Using on/off turns, process until dough comes together. Transfer to work surface. Form dough into ball; flatten into disk. Wrap in plastic and chill at least 2 hours. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 days ahead. Keep chilled.
Position 1 rack in top third and 1 rack in bottom third of oven; preheat to 350°F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Measure 1 tablespoon dough; form into ball, then roll into 2 1/2-inch-long log, tapering slightly at both ends. Gently bend into crescent shape. (If dough is very cold, it may form cracks; smooth over cracks before continuing.) Place on prepared sheet. Repeat with remaining dough, spacing cookies about 1 1/2 inches apart.
Bake cookies until slightly puffed and edges turn golden brown, about 20 minutes. Sift remaining 1 cup sugar over hot cookies. Cool completely on sheets on rack. Roll cooled cookies in powdered sugar remaining on sheets. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 week ahead. Store in airtight containers at room temperature.
Good to go: The hazelnut crescents and ginger cookies would both ship well. To make sure they arrive intact, pack the cookies in a metal tin between sheets of waxed paper. Ball up some waxed paper to place on top of the final cookie layer to make sure the cookies don’t shift and break in transit.

Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium heat. Add rice and stir 5 minutes. Add onion and garlic and sauté until onion is slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Add broth, tomato sauce and salt; bring to boil over medium-high heat. Boil uncovered until about half of broth is absorbed, stirring often, about 10 minutes.
Mix carrots, corn and peas into rice. Cover pot tightly with lid. Reduce heat to low and cook until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, about 10 minutes longer. Remove from heat. Let stand covered 10 minutes before serving. (Can be made 2 hours ahead. Cover rice with paper towel and let stand at room temperature. Remove towel; rewarm rice over low heat, stirring often.)

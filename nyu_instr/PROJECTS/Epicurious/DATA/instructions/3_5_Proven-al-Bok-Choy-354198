Heat oil in a deep 12-inch heavy skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers, then sauté garlic with thyme, bay leaf, and zest until garlic is pale golden and mixture is very fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add bok choy, tomatoes, olives, 3/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and reduce heat to medium. Cook, stirring occasionally, until bok choy is crisp-tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Discard bay leaf and stir in parsley.

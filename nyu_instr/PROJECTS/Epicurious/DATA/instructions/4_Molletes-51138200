Preheat the oven or toaster oven to 500°F.
Heat a large pan over medium heat until it's nice and hot. Spread the butter over the cut sides of the roll halves. Place them, cut sides down, in the pan and cook until they are lightly golden brown and crispy, a minute or two.
Spread a thin layer of beans over the toasted side of each roll. Top with a thin layer of cheese. Cook the molletes (open-faced) in the oven just until the cheese has melted and turned golden brown in a few spots, 3 to 5 minutes.
Serve the molletes beside a bowl of the pico de gallo and let everyone top the molletes with pico de gallo themselves.

Preheat the oven to 350°F. In a bowl with a fork stir together 1/2 cup of the brown sugar, 1 cup of the flour, and the butter until the mixture is combined well, press the mixture evenly onto the bottom of a 13-by 9-inch baking pan, and bake it in the middle of the oven for 10 minutes. In the bowl with the fork combine the remaining 1 cup brown sugar, the remaining 3 tablespoons flour, the coconut, the almonds, the eggs, the vanilla, and the salt and blend the mixture well. Spread the coconut mixture evenly over the crust and bake the mixture for 20 minutes, or until it is pale golden. Cut the mixture into 48 bars and let the bar cool completely in the pan on a rack. The coconut bars may be made 1 month in advance and kept frozen in airtight containers.

Peel jícama and carrot and with the fine shredding disk of a food processor shred coarse. (Alternatively, peeled vegetables may be cut into fine julienne strips.) Separate onion into rings. In a bowl whisk together vinegar, mustard, and oil until emulsified. Add jícama, carrot, onion, and salt and pepper to taste and toss well.

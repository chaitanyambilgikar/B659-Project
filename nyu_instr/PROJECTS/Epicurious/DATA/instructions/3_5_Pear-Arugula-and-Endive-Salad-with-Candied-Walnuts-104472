Whisk first 4 ingredients in medium bowl to blend. Add walnut oil and extra-virgin olive oil; whisk until well blended. Season dressing to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Let stand at room temperature 1 hour and rewhisk before continuing.)
Toss arugula in large bowl with enough dressing to coat. Divide arugula among 10 plates. Arrange endive leaves and pear slices atop arugula on each. Drizzle with more dressing. Sprinkle with Candied Walnuts and serve.

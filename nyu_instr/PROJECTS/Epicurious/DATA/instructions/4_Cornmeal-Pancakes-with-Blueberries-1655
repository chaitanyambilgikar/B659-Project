Preheat oven to 200°F. Mix 1 1/4 cups cornmeal, 1/2 cup pastry flour, 1/2 cup all purpose flour, 1 teaspoon baking powder, 1 teaspoon baking soda and 1 teaspoon salt in large bowl. Whisk 2 cups buttermilk, 3 tablespoons melted butter, egg yolks and honey in medium bowl to blend. Add to dry ingredients and stir until blended. Beat egg whites in another medium bowl until stiff but not dry. Fold whites into batter in 2 additions.
Melt 2 tablespoons butter in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Drop batter by 1/4 cupfuls into skillet. Sprinkle each pancake with 2 tablespoons blueberries. Cook pancakes until bottoms are golden brown and bubbles form on top, about 2 minutes. Turn pancakes over. Cook until bottoms are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Transfer pancakes to large baking sheet. Place pancakes in oven to keep warm. Repeat with remaining batter and blueberries, adding more butter to skillet as necessary.
Serve hot with maple syrup.

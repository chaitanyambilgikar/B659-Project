Sift flour, baking powder, spices and salt into medium bowl. Using electric mixer, beat butter in large bowl until light. Gradually beat in 3/4 cup sugar. Beat in egg and vanilla extract. Gradually beat in dry ingredients. If dough is too soft to mold, refrigerate until firm enough.
Spoon dough onto large sheet of plastic wrap. Roll into 7-inch-long, 2 1/4-inch-diameter log. Wrap tightly. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
Preheat oven to 350°F. Grease 2 large baking sheets. Unwrap dough and cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Place on baking sheets, spacing slices 1 inch apart. Bake until light golden brown, about 12 minutes. Transfer cookies to rack and cool. (Can be made 1 week ahead. Store in airtight container at room temperature.)
Place doilies or stencils atop cookies. Sift powdered sugar over. Carefully remove doilies or stencils and serve.

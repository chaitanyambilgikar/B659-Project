Preheat oven to 400°F. Butter baking sheet. Sift flour, 1/4 cup sugar, baking powder, salt and baking soda into large bowl. Add butter; rub in with fingertips until mixture resembles coarse meal. Stir in nuts. Whisk milk, sour cream, egg and vanilla in medium bowl; set aside 1 1/2 tablespoons for glaze. Make well in center of dry ingredients; add remaining milk mixture. Stir just until dough forms. Let stand 3 minutes. Turn out onto floured surface. Using floured hands, knead gently until dough comes together, about 5 turns. Pat into 7 1/2-inch round. Using sharp knife, cut into 8 wedges; brush with glaze. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon sugar.
Transfer wedges to baking sheet, spacing apart. Bake scones until golden and crusty, about 20 minutes. Transfer to rack and cool slightly. Serve warm.

For marinade: Whisk first 7 ingredients in large bowl. Add chicken; turn to coat. Cover and chill overnight, turning occasionally.
For coating: Mix first 10 ingredients in another large bowl. Place 1 wire rack on each of 2 rimmed baking sheets. Remove 1 chicken breast from bowl. Turn chicken breast in coating mixture. Transfer to rack, skin side up. Repeat with remaining chicken breasts, arranging 3 breasts on each rack. Let stand 30 minutes.

Butter 13x9x2-inch glass baking dish. Mix 1 3/4 cups sour cream, chilies, green onions, 1/2 cup cilantro and cumin in large bowl. Mix in chicken and 1 cup cheddar cheese. Season filling to taste with salt and pepper.
Spoon generous 1/2 cup filling down center of each tortilla. Top filling with cream cheese strip. Roll up each tortilla, enclosing filling. Arrange enchiladas seam side down in prepared dish. (Can be made 3 hours ahead. Cover and chill.)
Preheat oven to 350°F. Pour picante sauce over enchiladas. Cover and bake until sauce bubbles and enchiladas are heated through, about 45 minutes. Uncover, sprinkle with remaining 1 cup cheddar cheese and bake until cheese melts, about 5 minutes.
Top with remaining sour cream. Garnish with cilantro, if desired.

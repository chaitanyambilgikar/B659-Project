To make the dip, heat the olive oil over medium-low heat in a 4-quart soup pot. Add the onions and shallots, and sauté until softened and clear, about 8 minutes. Add the salt, tomatoes, tomato juice, tomato paste, broth, bay leaf, basil, and thyme. Bring to a boil, lower to a simmer, and cook for 30 minutes.
Mix the rice flour with the soymilk and the soy creamer. Whisk into the tomato mixture and simmer 5 minutes more. Remove the bay leaf.
Puree the dip in 2 batches in a blender until smooth and creamy. At this point, taste the soup. If you think it needs to be sweeter, add the sugar, then season to taste with freshly ground pepper.
To make the Pimento Cheese Bites, mix the cheese, mayonnaise, green onion, pimento, olives, salt, pepper, and red pepper sauce in a small bowl. Divide equally among 3 slices of the bread and top with the remaining bread slices. Heat a 10- or 12-inch non-stick sauté pan over medium heat. Spray with the cooking spray. If you're not watching your fat grams, add a tablespoon of the nonhydrogenated soy spread to the pan. Cook the sandwiches on each side until browned and cheese has melted. Add more spray or soy spread as you go along. Cut into quarters and serve with the dip.

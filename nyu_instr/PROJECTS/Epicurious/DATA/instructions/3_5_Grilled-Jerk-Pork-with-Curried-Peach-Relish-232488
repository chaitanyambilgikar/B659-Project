Make relish: Cut a shallow X in bottom of each peach and tomato with a sharp paring knife and blanch in 2 batches in a 4-quart saucepan of boiling water 10 seconds. Transfer peaches and tomatoes with a slotted spoon to a bowl of ice and cold water and let stand until cool enough to handle. Peel peaches and tomatoes, then halve peaches lengthwise and pit. Cut peaches into 1-inch pieces. Coarsely chop tomatoes.
Cook onion, ginger, and salt in oil in a 3-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Add curry powder and cook, stirring constantly, 1 minute. Add peaches and tomatoes with any juices, sugar, and lime juice and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until mixture is thick and peaches are tender but still hold their shape, about 8 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and cool, uncovered, then chill, covered, at least 8 hours.
Marinate pork: Combine scallions, thyme, salt, allspice, pepper, lime juice, molasses, and hot sauce in a blender and blend until smooth. Put pork in a nonreactive dish and rub all over with marinade. Marinate, covered and chilled, turning occasionally, 8 hours. Bring to room temperature before grilling.
Grill pork: Prepare grill for cooking over medium-hot charcoal (moderate heat for gas); see "Grilling Procedure," below.
Discard any marinade remaining in dish, then brush pork lightly with oil and grill on a lightly oiled grill rack, turning occasionally and basting frequently with oil, until thermometer inserted diagonally into center of meat registers 145°F, 15 to 25 minutes.
Transfer pork to a cutting board and let stand 15 minutes. (Internal temperature will rise to about 155°F.) Serve pork with relish.
Grilling Procedure If using a charcoal grill, open vents on bottom of grill, then light charcoal. When charcoal turns grayish white (about 15 minutes from lighting), hold your hand 5 inches above grill rack to determine heat for charcoal as follows:
Hot: When you can hold your hand there for 1 to 2 seconds
Medium-hot: 3 to 4 seconds
Low: 5 to 6 seconds
If using a gas grill, preheat burners on high, covered, 10 minutes, then, if necessary, reduce to heat specified in recipe.

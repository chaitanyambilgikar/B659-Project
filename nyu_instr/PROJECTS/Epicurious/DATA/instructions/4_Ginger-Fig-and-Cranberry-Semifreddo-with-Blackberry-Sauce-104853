Line 9x5x3-inch metal loaf pan with plastic wrap, extending over sides by 3 inches. Whisk egg yolks, sugar and white wine in medium metal bowl to blend. Set bowl over saucepan of simmering water; whisk egg mixture constantly until candy thermometer registers 160°F, about 5 minutes. Remove from over water. Using electric mixer, beat until cool and thick, about 5 minutes. Beat in orange peel.
Beat chilled whipping cream in large bowl until peaks form. Add egg mixture and gently fold together. Fold in chopped figs, chopped cranberries, and minced ginger. Transfer mixture to prepared pan. Cover with plastic wrap overhang; freeze overnight. (Can be made 3 days ahead. Keep frozen.)
Turn semifreddo out onto platter. Peel off plastic wrap. Let stand 5 minutes to soften slightly. Slice semifreddo. Place 1 slice of semifreddo on each plate. Drizzle Blackberry Sauce over each slice and serve.

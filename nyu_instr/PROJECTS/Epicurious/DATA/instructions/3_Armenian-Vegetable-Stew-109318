Cook eggplant, zucchini, bell peppers, apple, onion, and garlic in oil in a 5-quart heavy pot over moderately low heat, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are softened, about 40 minutes. Stir in tomatoes with juice, okra, tomato paste, salt, and pepper and cook, covered, stirring occasionally, until stew is slightly thickened, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in lemon juice. Cool, uncovered, and serve warm or at room temperature. Stir in parsley and salt to taste just before serving.

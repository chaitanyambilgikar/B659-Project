In a large heavy skillet cook garlic and onion in oil over moderate heat, stirring, until onion is softened.
Add beef and cook, stirring and breaking up any lumps with a fork, until cooked through. Drain off any excess fat if desired.
Add remaining ingredients, adding just enough juice to create a spoonably loose but not soupy mixture. Simmer sauce, stirring occasionally, 10 minutes.

To make the fritters: Whisk together first 5 ingredients in small bowl; let stand 10 minutes. Combine flour, 1/2 cup sugar, baking powder and salt in medium bowl. Using fingers or pastry blender, add chilled margarine to flour mixture and cut in until mixture resembles coarse meal. Stir egg mixture thoroughly into dry ingredients.
Heat 2 inches vegetable oil in heavy medium saucepan to 350°F. Working in batches, drop batter by rounded tablespoonfuls into hot oil. Cook until brown, turning occasionally, about 3 minutes. Transfer fritters to paper towel-lined cookie sheet and cool.
Combine powdered sugar and 1/4 cup liqueur in small deep bowl. Add enough water to make medium-thick glaze. Dip fritters halfway into glaze. Arrange fritters glaze side up on plate. (Can be prepared 6 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.)
Arrange 3 fritters on each of 8 plates. Spoon compote alongside. Garnish with fresh mint and serve.
To make the compote: Bring water, sugar and aniseed to boil in heavy medium saucepan over high heat, stirring until sugar dissolves. Boil until reduced to 1 cup, about 20 minutes. Place apricots in medium bowl. Strain boiling syrup over apricots. Discard aniseed. Add liqueur to apricots and stir. Cover and let stand at room temperature until apricots are tender, about 8 hours. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Let stand at room temperature.)
Add pineapple, strawberries and kiwi fruit to apricots. Toss well. Cover and refrigerate 1 hour.

Place chicken pieces in a shallow bowl with the carrots, onion, garlic, leek, salt, pepper, cloves, ginger, thyme, and just enough red wine to cover. Marinate for 24 hours in the refrigerator.
To cook, brown the drained chicken in olive oil until nicely covered on all sides. Place in a deep casserole with pig's foot or pork skin and a tiny piece of orange rind. Strain marinade and add just enough to cover the chicken (if more liquid is needed, add red wine). Cover casserole and simmer on top of the stove or in a 300°F oven for 3 to 4 hours. Remove chicken to a hot platter, skin fat from juices and pour them over chicken. Serve with noodles, macaroni or any pasta and asparagus or endive. To serve cold, arrange chicken in a bowl, pour juices over it and chill until jellied. With this, drink Volnay.

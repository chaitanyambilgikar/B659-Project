Set a steamer rack inside a wide 6- to 8-quart pot and fill bottom with water (not above rack), then bring to a boil.
Arrange chicken in 1 layer in a shallow heatproof bowl small enough to fit just inside pot.
Steam chicken in bowl on rack, covered with lid, until just cooked through, about 25 minutes. Remove bowl from pot using tongs. When chicken is cool enough to handle, coarsely shred, discarding skin and bones. Reserve liquid in bowl.
Meanwhile, stir together lime juice, bean paste, red-chile oil, Sichuan-pepper oil, ginger, garlic, chile, salt, and 2 tablespoons reserved chicken liquid in a large bowl. Stir in chicken, cilantro, and salt to taste.

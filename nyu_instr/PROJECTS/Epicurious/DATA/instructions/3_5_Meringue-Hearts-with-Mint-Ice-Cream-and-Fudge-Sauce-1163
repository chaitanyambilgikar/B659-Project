For sauce: Melt butter with corn syrup in heavy small saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally. Add chocolate, sugar and cream. Whisk until chocolate melts and sugar dissolves. (Can be made 1 week ahead. Cover; chill.)
For Meringues: Preheat oven to 225°F. Line 2 baking sheets with foil; butter foil. Place 3 3/4-inch heart-shaped cookie cutter on foil-lined sheet. Using electric mixer, beat whites in large bowl to soft peaks. Gradually add 1 cup sugar; continuing beating until stiff and shiny. Spoon 1/4 cup meringue inside cookie cutter on sheet. Using back of spoon spread meringue evenly. Lift up cookie cutter; place on another section of foil-lined sheet. Repeat with remaining meringue, forming 6 hearts on each sheet.
Bake meringues until crisp and dry, about 1 hour. Cool meringues on sheets 10 minutes. Peel meringues off foil. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cool completely. Store airtight at room temperature.)
Mix ice cream, 1/2 cup crushed peppermint candy and extract in medium bowl. Cover and freeze until almost semi-firm, about 2 hours.
Place meringues flat side up on baking sheet and freeze 15 minutes. Spoon 1/2 cup ice cream atop 1 meringue. Top with another meringue, flat side up. Press gently to flatten, forming sandwich. Run spatula around sides of ice cream to even sides. Freeze. Repeat with remaining meringues and ice cream. Cover and freeze at least 1 hour and up to 6 hours.
Stir sauce over medium-low heat just until warm. Sift powdered sugar over tops of meringues, coating completely. Place on plates. Spoon sauce around. Sprinkle chopped candy over sauce.

Preheat oven to 300°F.
Bake tomatoes in a shallow baking pan in middle of oven 10 minutes. Coarsely chop yellow and red tomatoes separately. Blend yellow tomatoes, 2 tablespoons oil, 1 teaspoon chile-pepper water, and 1 teaspoon garlic in a blender until smooth. Force soup through a fine sieve into a large liquid-measuring cup, pressing hard on solids, and season with salt. Make red-tomato soup in same manner with remaining soup ingredients, straining into a separate liquid-measuring cup. Chill soups, covered, until cold.
Pour soups simultaneously from opposite sides into a Martini glass (colors will remain separate), using about one fourth of each soup. Repeat to fill 3 more glasses.

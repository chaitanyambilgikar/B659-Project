Preheat broiler. Place tomatillos, onion, and jalapeño on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet. Broil, turning halfway through, until blistered, 12-15 minutes. Let cool.
Transfer tomatillo mixture to a blender, add 2 tablespoons lime juice, and pulse until a chunky purée forms. Season with salt and more lime juice, if desired. DO AHEAD: Salsa can be made 3 days ahead. Cover; chill.

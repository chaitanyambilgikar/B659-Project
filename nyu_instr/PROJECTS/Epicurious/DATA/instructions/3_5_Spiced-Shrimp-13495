In a small bowl stir together all ingredients except shrimp and oil. Arrange shrimp in one layer on a baking sheet and sprinkle with half of spice mixture. Turn shrimp over and sprinkle with remaining mixture.
In a heavy skillet (preferably cast-iron) heat 1 tablespoon oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and sauté half of shrimp until golden brown and cooked through, about 1 1/2 minutes on each side. Sauté remaining shrimp in remaining 1 tablespoon oil in same manner.
Serve shrimp with lemon wedges.

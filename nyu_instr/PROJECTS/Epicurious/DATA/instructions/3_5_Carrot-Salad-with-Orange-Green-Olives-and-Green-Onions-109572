Cook carrots in large pot of boiling salted water until crisp-tender, about 7 minutes. Drain well.
Whisk oil, lemon juice, orange peel, and coriander in large bowl to blend. Add hot carrots and toss to coat. Cool, tossing occasionally. Season with salt and pepper. Drizzle with honey, if desired. Stir in olives and green onions. Cover and refrigerate at least 3 hours. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Keep refrigerated.)
Stir salad to redistribute dressing. Garnish edges of platter with orange slices and parsley. Mound carrots in center.

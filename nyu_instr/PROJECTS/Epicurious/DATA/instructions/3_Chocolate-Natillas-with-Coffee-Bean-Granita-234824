Stir chocolate in top of double boiler set over simmering water until melted and smooth. Remove from over water.
Pour 3 cups whole milk into heavy medium saucepan. Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add bean. Bring milk to simmer over medium-high heat. Remove from heat; cover and let steep 15 minutes. Whisk egg yolks and 1/4 cup milk in medium bowl to blend. Sift cornstarch over; whisk until mixture is blended and smooth. Gradually whisk in warm milk mixture. Return mixture to same saucepan. Whisk mixture constantly over medium heat until custard boils, thickens, and is smooth, about 4 minutes. Discard vanilla bean. Whisk in sweetened condensed milk and vanilla, then whisk in melted chocolate. Pour pudding through fine strainer into 4-cup measuring cup. Divide chocolate pudding among 8 goblets or dessert glasses (allow about 1/2 cup chocolate pudding for each glass). Cover puddings and refrigerate overnight.

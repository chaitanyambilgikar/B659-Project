Preheat oven to 450°F. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with foil. Combine 1/4 cup cilantro, lime juice, garlic, 3 teaspoons cumin, and 1/2 teaspoon paprika in a small bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Pour 1/2 cup of marinade into a resealable plastic bag. Add tofu. Seal bag; shake to coat. Let marinate at room temperature, turning occasionally, for 10-15 minutes.
Meanwhile, transfer remaining marinade to a blender. Add 1/4 cup cilantro, 2 tablespoons oil, and honey; purée until smooth. Season sauce with salt and pepper.
Combine onion and peppers in a large bowl. Toss with remaining 2 tablespoons oil, 1/2 teaspoon cumin, and 1/4 teaspoon paprika. Season with salt and pepper.
Drain tofu. Season both sides with salt and pepper and place in a single layer on one side of prepared sheet. Spread vegetables in a single layer opposite tofu.
Roast, stirring vegetables occasionally, until vegetables are tender and tofu is lightly browned, 20-25 minutes.
Divide among plates. Drizzle with sauce. Garnish with remaining 1/4 cup cilantro.

Mix 6 tablespoons butter and 3 tablespoons dill in small bowl to blend. Season with salt and pepper. (Dill butter can be made 2 days ahead; cover and chill. Bring to room temperature before using.)
Sauté bacon in heavy large skillet over medium heat until brown and crisp. Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towels. (Can be made 2 hours ahead; let stand at room temperature.)
Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add turnips and sauté until tender and golden, about 9 minutes. Add peas and dill butter and stir until peas are heated through, about 3 minutes. Stir in bacon. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to bowl. Sprinkle with remaining 1 tablespoon dill and serve.

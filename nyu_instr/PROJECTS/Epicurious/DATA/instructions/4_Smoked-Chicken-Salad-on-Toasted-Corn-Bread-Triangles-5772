Mix first 4 ingredients in small bowl to blend. Mix in chicken, bell pepper, tomato, jicama and onion. Season to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
Preheat oven to 350°F. Cut corn bread into 1/3-inch-thick slices. Cut each slice diagonally in half, forming 2 triangles. Place on 2 baking sheets. Bake until lightly toasted, about 10 minutes. Cool.
Top each triangle with 1 tablespoon chicken salad. Arrange on platter. Garnish each with parsley leaf, if desired.

Combine 3 cups chopped onions, lamb, and 2 cups water in heavy large pot. Add cinnamon sticks, ground cinnamon, salt, pepper, ginger, and saffron; bring to boil over medium-high heat. Partially cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer gently 1 1/2 hours. Add tomatoes and 2 tablespoons parsley. Continue to simmer, partially covered, until lamb is tender and juices thicken, about 30 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Remove cinnamon sticks.
Meanwhile, heat oil in heavy large skillet over high heat. Add remaining 6 cups chopped onions. Sauté until beginning to brown, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium; sauté until onions are deep brown, stirring often, about 45 minutes. DO AHEAD: Stew and onions can be made 1 day ahead. Cool, cover, and chill separately. Rewarm each over low heat before continuing.
Transfer lamb stew to large shallow bowl. Scatter caramelized onions and remaining 2 tablespoons parsley over.

1. Cook the noodles in plenty of rapidly boiling water until al dente.
2. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large skillet or stir-fry pan. Add the onion and sauté over medium heat until golden.
3. Add all the mushrooms and the wine to the pan. Cover and simmer over low heat until the mushrooms are tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in the tofu and lemon juice and heat gently just until heated through, then remove from the heat. Season to taste with pepper.
4. Drain the noodles and transfer to a serving dish. Stir in the margarine and season with salt, if desired.
5. To serve, place a bed of noodles on each plate, then top with some of the mushroom mixture. Garnish each serving with a sprinkling of parsley, if desired, plus a dusting of paprika.

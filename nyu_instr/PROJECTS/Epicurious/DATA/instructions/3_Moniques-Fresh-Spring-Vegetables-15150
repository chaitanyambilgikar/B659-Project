Melt the butter in a large, heavy saucepan over medium heat. Add the carrots, onions, and shallots, stirring so they are coated with the butter. Season lightly with salt. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until the carrots are softened but still have plenty of texture, about 8 minutes.
Stir in the water, season with salt and pepper, and continue cooking, covered, until the carrots are nearly tender, an additional 8 minutes. Add the peas and stir. Then lay the lettuce heart and leaves over the vegetables. Cover, and cook until the lettuce leaves are wilted and the peas are done to your liking (I like them bright green and cooked through to a juicy tenderness), 10 to 15 minutes.
Adjust the seasonings, and serve.

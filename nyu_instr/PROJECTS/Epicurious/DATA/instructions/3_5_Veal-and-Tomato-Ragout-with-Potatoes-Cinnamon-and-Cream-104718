Place veal in medium bowl. Sprinkle flour over; toss to coat. Shake off excess. Sprinkle veal with salt and pepper. Melt butter with oil in heavy large pot over high heat. Working in batches, add veal and sauté until brown on all sides, about 6 minutes per batch. Transfer to bowl. Add onions and celery to pot; sauté until vegetables begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Return veal to pot. Add wine and bring to boil, scraping up browned bits. Boil until liquid is reduced by half, about 3 minutes. Stir in tomato sauce, 1 cup water, parsley, and cinnamon sticks; bring to boil. Reduce heat to low; cover and simmer 1 hour 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Stir potatoes and cream into stew; season with salt and pepper. Cover; simmer until veal and potatoes are very tender, stirring often and thinning with more water if necessary, about 1 hour. Discard cinnamon sticks and serve.

Cook fettuccine in medium pot of boiling water until just tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally. Drain, reserving 1/4 cup cooking liquid.
Meanwhile, stir walnuts in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat until lightly toasted, about 2 minutes. Transfer nuts to small plate. Pour artichoke marinade and wine into same skillet. Boil until reduced to 3/4 cup, about 2 minutes. Whisk in sour cream and remove from heat (do not boil). Mix in artichokes, tomatoes and 1/3 cup chives.
Add pasta to sauce. Toss to blend well, adding reserved pasta cooking liquid by tablespoonfuls if pasta is dry. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Divide pasta between 2 plates. Sprinkle with walnuts and remaining 2 tablespoons chives and serve.

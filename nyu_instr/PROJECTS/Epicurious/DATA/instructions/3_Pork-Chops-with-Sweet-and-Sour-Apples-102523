Spray large nonstick skillet with nonstick spray and heat over medium-high heat. Sprinkle pork chops with salt and pepper. Add pork to skillet; sauté 4 minutes. Sprinkle pork chops with 1/2 teaspoon oregano; turn pork chops and sauté just until cooked through, about 2 minutes. Transfer to plate; cover with foil.
Heat oil in the same skillet over medium-high heat. Add apple and onion wedges and remaining 1/2 teaspoon oregano. Sauté until apples and onion are tender and golden, about 10 minutes. Return pork and any accumulated juices to skillet. Pour apple juice and vinegar over; cook until pork is heated through and liquid is slightly reduced, about 1 minute. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer pork and apple mixture to plates and serve.

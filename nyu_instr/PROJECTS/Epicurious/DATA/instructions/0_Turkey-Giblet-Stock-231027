Pat neck and giblets dry. Heat oil in a 6-quart heavy pot over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then brown neck and giblets, turning occasionally, 8 to 10 minutes. Add celery, carrot, onion, garlic, thyme, and peppercorns and sauté, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are browned, 7 to 9 minutes. Add water and broth and bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, until liquid is reduced to about 3 cups, 45 to 60 minutes.
Pour stock through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl, discarding solids. If using stock right away, skim off and discard any fat.

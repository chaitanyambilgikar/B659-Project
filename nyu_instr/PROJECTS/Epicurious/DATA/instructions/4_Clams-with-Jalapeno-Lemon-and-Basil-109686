Melt butter in very large pot over medium-high heat. Add minced garlic and jalapeño; stir until garlic is golden, about 2 minutes. Add tomato sauce, wine, and lemon juice and bring to boil. Add clams; cover and boil until clams open, about 9 minutes (discard any clams that do not open). Add basil and lemon peel. Season with pepper. Transfer clams and sauce to large bowl and serve.

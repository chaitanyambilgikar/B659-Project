For crepes: Whisk 1 cup water, flour, eggs and salt in medium bowl until well blended (batter should be thin). Add additional water if necessary. Heat heavy small skillet over low heat. Brush pan lightly with oil. Stir batter and ladle 3 to 4 tablespoons into corner of pan, tilting so batter just coats bottom. Cook crepe until bottom is set (do not brown), about 1 minute. Loosen edges with knife. Turn crepe and cook until second side is set (do not brown), about 5 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter, stirring occasionally and brushing pan with oil as necessary. (Can be prepared ahead. Layer crepes between sheets of waxed paper and cool completely. Wrap tightly and refrigerate 3 days or freeze 1 month. Bring to room temperature before using.)
For filling: Mix ricotta, 1/2 cup mozzarella, Romano, egg and parsley in bowl. Season mixture to taste with salt and pepper.
Pour 3/4 cup spaghetti sauce into large baking pan. Spoon 3 tablespoons filling down center of crepe. Fold both sides of crepe over filling. Arrange seam side down in baking pan. Repeat with remaining filling and enough crepes to finish. Pour remaining 3/4 cup sauce over. Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup mozzarella. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.)
Preheat oven to 350°F. Bake until heated through, about 30 minutes.

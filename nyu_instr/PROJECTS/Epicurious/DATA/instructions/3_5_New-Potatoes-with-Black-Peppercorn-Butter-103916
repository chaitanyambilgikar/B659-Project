Combine broth and peppercorns in small saucepan. Cover and simmer 30 minutes. Uncover and simmer until mixture is reduced to 1/4 cup, about 15 minutes. Add brandy; simmer until mixture is reduced to 3 tablespoons, about 10 minutes. Cool. Blend peppercorn mixture, butter, lemon juice, shallot and thyme in processor until peppercorns are finely chopped. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Chill. Use at room temperature.)
Cook potatoes in pot of boiling salted water until tender, about 25 minutes. Drain. Quarter potatoes. Place in large bowl. Add onions and 1/4 cup peppercorn butter (reserve remaining peppercorn butter for another use); toss gently. Season to taste with salt.

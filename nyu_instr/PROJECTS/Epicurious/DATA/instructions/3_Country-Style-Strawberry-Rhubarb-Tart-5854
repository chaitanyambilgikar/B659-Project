For crust: Blend first 5 ingredients in processor until nuts are finely ground. Add butter; cut in using on/off turns until mixture resembles coarse meal. Mix in enough water to form moist clumps. Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk. Wrap in plastic; chill until firm, about 1 hour. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Keep chilled. Let soften slightly at room temperature before rolling.)
Preheat oven to 400°F. Place 9-inch-diameter tart pan bottom on baking sheet. Roll out dough on floured work surface to 13-inch round. Transfer to prepared baking sheet, centering atop tart pan bottom.
For filling: Brush dough with some of egg glaze. Sprinkle hazelnuts over dough. Mix 3/4 cup sugar and next 5 ingredients in large bowl. Mound in center of dough, leaving 1 1/2-inch border over filling, pleating loosely and pinch any cracks to seal. Brush crust with remaining egg glaze. Sprinkle crust with 1 tablespoon sugar.
Bake tart until crust is brown and filling bubbles, about 55 minutes. Transfer baking sheet to rack and cool tart 15 minutes. Slide metal spatula under edges of tart to loosen. Transfer tart to platter. Serve warm with ice cream.

Mix first 6 ingredients in 8 x 8 x 2-inch glass baking dish. Add chicken; turn to coat with marinade. Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours and up to 1 day.
Remove chicken from marinade and reserve marinade. Pat chicken dry and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Heat olive oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken to skillet and sauté until brown, about 3 minutes per side. Add reserved marinade and chicken broth and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer uncovered until chicken is cooked through, turning occasionally, about 6 minutes. Transfer chicken and sauce to platter. Serve with yogurt, if desired.

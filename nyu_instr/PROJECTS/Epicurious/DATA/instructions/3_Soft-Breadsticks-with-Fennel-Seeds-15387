In the bowl of an electric mixer proof the yeast with the sugar in 1/4 cup lukewarm water for 5 minutes, or until it is foamy. With the paddle attachment beat in 1 cup warm water, 3 cups of the flour, the salt, the fennel seeds, and the pepper and beat the dough until it is smooth. With the dough hook of the electric mixer or by hand knead the dough, kneading in enough of the remaining 1/2 cup flour to form a smooth, elastic dough, for 10 minutes. Form the dough into a ball, put it in a well-buttered large bowl, turning it to coat it with the butter, and let it rise, covered with plastic wrap, in a warm place for 1 hour, or until it is double in bulk. Punch down the dough and, working with one small piece of dough at a time, form it into 1/4-inch-thick ropes, each about 8 inches long. Arrange the ropes on buttered baking sheets, brush them lightly with the egg wash, and bake them in batches in the upper third of a preheated 450°F. oven for 15 minutes, or until they are golden. The breadsticks may be made 1 day in advance and kept in an airtight container. Reheat the breadsticks, wrapped in foil, before serving.

Season steak with salt and pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook steak until medium-rare, about 4 minutes per side (or 2 minutes per side if using skirt steak). Transfer steak to a plate.
Wipe out skillet; add remaining 2 tablespoons oil and heat over medium-high heat. Add garlic and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring, until garlic begins to brown, about 1 minute. Add carrots, fennel, and lemon; season with salt and pepper. Cook, tossing occasionally, until vegetables are crisp-tender, about 4 minutes.
Add broth to skillet and bring to a boil. Stir in couscous. Remove from heat; cover and let steam until tender, 5-8 minutes. Add olives, season with salt and pepper, and fluff couscous with a fork. Slice steak against the grain; fold into couscous. Divide lemon couscous among plates, drizzle with oil, and garnish with cilantro.

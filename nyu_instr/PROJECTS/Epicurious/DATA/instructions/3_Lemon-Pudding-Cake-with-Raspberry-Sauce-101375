To prepare the cake: Preheat the oven to 325°.
Whip the egg yolks and 1 cup of the sugar until it reaches the ribbon stage. Add the flour and mix well. Whisk in the lemon juice, salt, and milk until completely combined.
In a separate bowl, whip the egg whites until soft peaks form. Add 1/2 cup of the sugar, and whip until stiff peaks form. Gently fold the egg whites into the lemon mixture.
Pour the batter into a plastic wrap-lined 9 by 13-inch pan and bake for 30 minutes, or until lightly browned. Remove the cake from the oven and let it cool slightly, then refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
Place a piece of plastic wrap over the pudding cake and flip it onto a flat surface. Cut eight 3-inch circles with a ring cutter.
To prepare the sauce: Reserve 16 raspberries for the garnish. Purée the remaining raspberries with the remaining 1/4 cup sugar for 2 minutes, or until smooth. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve.
Spoon some of the raspberry sauce in the center of each plate and top with a circle of pudding cake. Place 2 raspberries and a mint sprig in the center of each cake.

2 1 1/2- to 2-pound live lobsters

Drop 1 lobster, head first, into large pot of boiling water. Cover; cook 3 minutes (lobster will not be fully cooked). Using tongs, transfer lobster to baking sheet. Return water to boil. Repeat with second lobster.
Transfer 1 lobster, shell side down, to work surface. Place tip of large knife into center of lobster. Cut lobster lengthwise in half from center to end of head (knife may not cut through shell), then cut in half from center to end of tail. Use poultry shears to cut through shell. Repeat with second lobster.
Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Keeping lobster halves meat side up, brush shells with olive oil. Place halves, meat side up, on barbecue. Brush meat with oil; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place pans with sauces at edge of barbecue to rewarm. Cover barbecue; grill lobsters until just opaque in thickest portion of tail, 7 to 9 minutes. Serve, passing warm sauces separately.

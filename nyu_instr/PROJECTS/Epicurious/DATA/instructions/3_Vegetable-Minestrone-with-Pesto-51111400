1. In a medium saucepan over moderate heat, warm the oil. Add the onion, celery, carrot, leek, potato, and parsley, and sauté, stirring frequently, until the vegetables are soft, about 5 minutes.
2. Add the fava beans, tomatoes, zucchini, and 2 quarts of water to the pot. Bring the soup to a boil, then add the green beans, peas, spinach, and the Parmigiano-Reggiano rind. Reduce the heat to moderately low, season to taste with salt and pepper, and simmer until the beans and potatoes are fully cooked and tender, about 20 minutes.
3. Remove and discard the Parmigiano-Reggiano rind. Divide the soup among heated soup bowls and top with the pesto. Note: You may cool, cover, and refrigerate the soup up to 3 days or freeze it for up to 2 months.

1. Put the egg white and cream of tartar in the bowl of a large freestanding electric mixer and beat together until frothy.
2. With the machine still running, gradually add the confectioners’ sugar until the mixture begins to stiffen and turn opaque white. Scrape down the side of the bowl and beat briefly on high. The mixture should be stiff but still pliable.
3. If necessary, thin the mixture with a little extra egg white or a drop of food coloring. Cover with a damp dish towel to prevent a crust from forming. To store, put it in a container, place plastic wrap directly over the surface to prevent a skin from forming, and seal the container. Keep in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.
4. To color the icing, add the appropriate paste food coloring in drops or on a toothpick or the tip of a knife and beat in until you achieve the required color.

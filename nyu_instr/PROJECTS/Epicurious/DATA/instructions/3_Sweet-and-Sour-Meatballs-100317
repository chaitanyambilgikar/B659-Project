Combine ground beef, breadcrumbs, celery, parsley, egg and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in medium bowl. Add 1 1/2 tablespoons soup mix; blend well. Using moistened hands, form mixture into 1-inch-diameter balls and place on sheet of foil.
Combine chili sauce, 3/4 cup water, raisins, vinegar, sugar and remaining soup mix in heavy large pot. Bring to simmer over medium-low heat. Drop meatballs into sauce. Cover pot and simmer until meatballs are cooked through and sauce thickens, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes.

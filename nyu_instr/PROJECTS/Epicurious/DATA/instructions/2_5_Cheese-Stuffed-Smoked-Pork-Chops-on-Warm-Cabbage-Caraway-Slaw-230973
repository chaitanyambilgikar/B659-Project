Toss together cabbage, carrot, vinegar, sugar, caraway seeds, and salt in a bowl and let stand, tossing occasionally, 15 minutes.
Holding a sharp small knife parallel to a work surface, cut a wide pocket in each chop, beginning at rounded edge and cutting through to bone. Divide cheese among pockets, packing it in and pressing chops flat. Pat chops dry and season with pepper.
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a wide 3- to 4-quart heavy pot over moderate heat until hot but not smoking, then cook slaw, tossing frequently, until cabbage is crisp-tender, 5 to 7 minutes.
Heat remaining tablespoon oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then sauté chops, turning over once, until browned, 2 to 4 minutes total. Cover skillet and cook chops until just heated through and cheese is melted, about 3 minutes more.
Divide slaw among 4 plates and top with chops.

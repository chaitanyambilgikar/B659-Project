Cook noodles in medium saucepan of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite. Drain well, reserving 4 tablespoons cooking liquid. Melt butter in same saucepan over medium heat. Add noodles, green onions and poppy seeds. Toss until pasta is well coated, adding reserved pasta cooking liquid by tablespoonfuls to moisten if noodles seem dry. Season noodles to taste with salt and pepper and serve.

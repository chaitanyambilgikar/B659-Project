Make red wine sauce: Melt 2 tablespoons butter in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add onions and carrot and sauté until deep brown, about 12 minutes. Add beef broth and next 4 ingredients; boil 10 minutes to blend flavors.
Mix flour and 1 tablespoon butter to paste in bowl. Whisk into sauce. Simmer until sauce thickens, whisking occasionally, about 10 minutes. Strain. Set aside.
Make lamb: Preheat oven to 400°F. Whisk honey, soy sauce and mustard in small bowl to blend; add 2 tablespoons glaze to sauce. Sprinkle lamb with salt and pepper. Place on baking sheet. Brush each rack with some of remaining glaze. Roast until thermometer inserted into center of lamb registers 130°F, brushing often with more glaze, about 35 minutes.
Rewarm sauce. Season with salt and pepper. Cut lamb between bones into chops. Serve chops with sauce.

Position rack in lowest third of oven and preheat to 400°F. Combine first 6 ingredients in large bowl. Crush a few berries in bowl with back of rubber spatula; toss to blend. Let stand until dry ingredients are moistened, about 15 minutes.
Roll out 1 pie-crust disk on lightly floured surface to 12 1/2-inch round. Transfer to 9-inch-diameter glass pie dish. Trim dough overhang to 3/4 inch. Spoon filling into crust. Roll out second pie-crust disk on lightly floured surface to 12-inch round. Using scalloped pastry cutter, cut dough into generous 1/2-inch-wide strips. Arrange dough strips across top of filling. Form lattice by arranging more dough strips at right angle to first strips, weaving strips if desired. Trim dough strips even with overhang on bottom crust. Tuck ends of dough strips and overhang under; press to seal. Crimp edges decoratively. Brush edges and lattice lightly with whipping cream.
Place pie on baking sheet. Bake 40 minutes. Cover crust edges with foil to prevent overbrowning. Continue to bake until filling bubbles thickly in center, about 50 minutes longer. Cool pie on rack at least 2 hours and up to 8 hours. Serve with vanilla ice cream.

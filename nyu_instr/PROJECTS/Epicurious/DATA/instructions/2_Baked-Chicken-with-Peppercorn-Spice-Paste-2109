Heat heavy small skillet over high heat. Add first 3 ingredients; stir until aromatic, about 2 minutes. Transfer spices and salt to processor; blend 30 seconds. Add cilantro, garlic, orange peel and oil and blend 30 seconds. (Can be prepared 3 days ahead; cover and chill.)
Preheat oven to 375°F. Place chicken in baking pan. Brush with soy sauce. Rub spice mixture over both sides of each chicken breast. Let stand 15 minutes. Bake until chicken is cooked through and brown, basting occasionally with pan juices and adding water to pan if juices evaporate, about 25 minutes. Baste again before serving.

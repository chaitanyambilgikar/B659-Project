Place fava beans in medium saucepan. Place Great Northern beans in large bowl. Add enough cold water to each to cover by 3 inches and let soak overnight.
Bring fava beans to boil in their soaking liquid. Boil 5 minutes. Drain fava beans and cool slightly. Using small sharp knife, make small slit in skin of each bean. Peel off outer skins and discard. Drain Great Northern beans.
Bring 6 cups water to boil in large pot. Add all beans, onion, carrot and celery. Partially cover; simmer over medium heat until beans are half cooked, about 30 minutes. Add cabbage and lettuce. Partially cover; cook until beans are tender, stirring occasionally, about 1 hour. Season with salt and pepper. Ladle into bowls. Sprinkle with Parmesan. Drizzle with oil.

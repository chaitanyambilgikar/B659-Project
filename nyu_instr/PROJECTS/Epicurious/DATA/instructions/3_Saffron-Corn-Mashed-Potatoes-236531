Prepare perfect mashed potatoes (but do not add milk). Meanwhile, heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and sauté for 2 minutes. Add fresh corn kernels garlic. Cook until corn is soft, stirring often, about 4 minutes. Add milk and saffron. Bring just to boil; remove from heat, cover, and let steep 10 minutes. Stir into potatoes. Season with salt.

Melt butter in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium-high heat, then cook kimchi, stirring occasionally, until edges are golden, about 6 minutes. Cool kimchi.
Place 2 perilla leaves over one half of each tortilla and top with one fourth of kimchi, 1 tablespoon sesame seeds, and 1/2 cup of each cheese. Fold in half to enclose filling.
Brush a 12-inch nonstick skillet or 2-burner nonstick griddle with oil and heat over medium heat until it just begins to smoke, then cook quesadillas, turning once, until golden and cheese is melted, about 4 min utes total. Serve immediately.

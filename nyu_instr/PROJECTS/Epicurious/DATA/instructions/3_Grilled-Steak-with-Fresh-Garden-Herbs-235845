Whisk first 4 ingredients in medium bowl. Gradually whisk in 1/4 cup olive oil, then herbs.
Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Sprinkle steaks generously with salt and pepper; brush lightly with olive oil. Grill steaks until charred and cooked to desired doneness, about 6 minutes per side for medium-rare rib-eye or 3 minutes per side for medium-rare skirt steak. Transfer steaks to platter; let rest 5 minutes. Spoon herb mixture over steaks; serve.

Preheat oven to 400°F. Butter 13x9x2-inch glass baking dish. Melt 1/2 tablespoon butter in small nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add breadcrumbs and stir until golden, about 4 minutes. Remove skillet from heat.
Bring milk and cream to simmer in medium saucepan. Remove from heat. Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in another medium saucepan over low heat. Add flour; stir 2 minutes. Whisk in milk mixture. Whisk until slightly thickened, about 4 minutes. Add Gorgonzola and whisk until cheese melts and sauce is almost smooth. Set aside.
Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite. Drain. Return pasta to pot. Add Gorgonzola sauce to pasta and toss to coat. Season pasta to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer to prepared baking dish. Sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese and breadcrumbs. Bake pasta until sauce bubbles, about 25 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes and serve.

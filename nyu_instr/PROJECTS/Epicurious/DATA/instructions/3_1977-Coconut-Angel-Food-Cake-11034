Make the cake: Onto a sheet of wax paper sift the flour 3 times. In a large bowl with an electric mixer beat the egg whites with the salt until they are frothy, add the cream of tartar, and beat the whites until they hold soft peaks. Beat in 1/2 cup of the sugar, a little at a time, add the vanilla and the almond extract, and beat the whites until they hold stiff peaks. Fold in the remaining 1/2 cup sugar, a little at a time, sift the flour over the whites in 4 batches, folding it in gently after each addition, and fold in the coconut. Spoon the batter into a tube pan, 9 inches across the top and 3 1/2 inches deep, and bake the cake in the middle of a preheated 275°F. oven for 1 1/2 hours. Hang the cake in the pan upside down on the neck of a bottle and let it cool for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, or until it is cooled completely. Release the cake from the side of the pan and from the center tube with a sharp knife, turn it out onto a rack, and invert it onto a cake plate.
Make the frosting: In a metal bowl whisk together the sugar, the egg whites, the zest, the orange juice, the corn syrup, and pinch of salt, set the bowl over a saucepan of simmering water, and cook the mixture, whisking until it registers 140°F. on a candy thermometer. Remove the pan from the heat and whisk the mixture over the hot water for 3 minutes. Remove the bowl from the pan and with an electric mixer beat the frosting at high speed for 7 to 10 minutes, or until it is cool and hold stiff peaks.
Spread the top and sides (including the center) of the cake with the frosting and coat the outside with the toasted coconut.

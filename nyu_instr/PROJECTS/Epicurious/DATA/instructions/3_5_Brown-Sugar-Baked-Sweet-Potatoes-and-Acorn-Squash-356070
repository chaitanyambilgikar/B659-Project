Preheat oven to 375°F with racks in upper and lower thirds.
Toss sweet potatoes and squash with butter, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Divide between two 17-by 11-inch 4-sided sheet pans. Bake, switching position of pans halfway through, 25 minutes.
Stir together brown sugar and nutmeg. Turn vegetable slices and sprinkle evenly with sugar mixture. Bake until golden and tender, 35 to 40 minutes more.

Butter and flour 9-inch-diameter springform pan. Mix flour, 1/4 cup sugar, yeast, lemon peel and salt in processor. Using on/off turns, add butter and blend until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add milk and 3 egg yolks. Using on/off turns, blend until soft dough forms. Using wet fingertips, press dough over bottom and 1 inch up sides of prepared pan. Cover tightly with plastic and let rise in warm draft-free area until light and puffy (dough will not double in volume), about 2 hours.
Preheat oven to 400°F. Whisk 2 eggs and cream in small bowl to blend. Sprinkle 1/3 cup brown sugar over bottom of tart. Pour cream mixture over. Sprinkle with remaining 1/3 cup sugar. Bake until dough puffs and browns and filling browns in spots, about 25 minutes. Transfer to rack. Cut around pan sides to loosen tart. Release pan sides. Cool 30 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.

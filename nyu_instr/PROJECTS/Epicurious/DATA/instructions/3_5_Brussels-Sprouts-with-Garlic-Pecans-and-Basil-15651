Combine brussels sprouts, cream and garlic in heavy large skillet. Bring to boil over medium-low heat. Cover skillet tightly and cook until brussels sprouts are crisp-tender but still bright green and almost all cream is absorbed, about 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, finely grind pecans with basil leaves and lemon peel in processor. Add pecan mixture to skillet. Toss until brussels sprouts are coated. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to serving bowl. Garnish with basil sprigs and lemon wedges, if desired, and serve.

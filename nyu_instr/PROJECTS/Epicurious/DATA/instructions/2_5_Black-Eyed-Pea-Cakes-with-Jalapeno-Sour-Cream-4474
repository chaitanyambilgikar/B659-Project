Place dried black-eyed peas in medium pot. Add enough cold water to cover by 3 inches; let stand overnight. Drain peas.
Return peas to pot. Add 3 cups water. Cover; simmer until peas are tender, stirring occasionally, about 40 minutes. Drain peas, reserving 1/3 cup cooking liquid.
Transfer 1 1/4 cups peas to processor and puree until smooth, adding enough reserved cooking liquid 1 tablespoon at a time to help blend. Transfer puree to a large bowl. Mix in milk, onion, lime juice, hot pepper sauce and remaining whole peas. Stir in flour, baking powder and baking soda. Season with salt and pepper. Mix in egg. Cover and chill batter 30 minutes.
Mix sour cream and jalapeño chilies in small bowl. Let stand 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 250°F. Heat 1/2 teaspoon oil in heavy large skillet over medium-low heat. Using 1 1/2 tablespoons batter for each pancake, spoon batter into skillet. Cook until bubbles atop pancakes break and batter is almost set, about 3 minutes. Turn pancakes over; cook until cooked through. Transfer pancakes to baking sheet; keep warm in oven. Repeat with remaining batter, adding more oil to skillet as needed, making 24 pancakes.
Spoon salsa onto plates. Arrange 4 pancakes alongside salsa on each plate. Top with sour cream mixture and serve.

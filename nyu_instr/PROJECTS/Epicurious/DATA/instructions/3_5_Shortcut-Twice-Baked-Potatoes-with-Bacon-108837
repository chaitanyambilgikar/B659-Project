Sauté bacon in heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat until crisp and brown. Transfer bacon to paper towels to drain.
Bake all potatoes in microwave on high until tender, about 10 minutes per side. Cut top 3/4 inch off each potato lengthwise. Scoop cooked potato flesh into medium bowl, leaving 1/4-inch-thick potato shell. Add butter and milk to potato flesh in bowl and mash well. Stir in bacon; season to taste with salt and pepper. Spoon potato mixture into shells. Place potatoes on baking sheet.
Preheat oven to 400°F. Bake potatoes until filling is heated through and shells are crisp, about 30 minutes.

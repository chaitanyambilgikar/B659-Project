Halve carrots lengthwise, then cut diagonally into 2-inch pieces. Cook carrots in a 4- to 6-quart pot of boiling salted water until just tender, 5 to 6 minutes. Drain in a colander and transfer to a bowl of ice and cold water to stop cooking. Let stand 5 minutes, then drain again and pat dry.
While carrots cool, stir together cilantro, onion, oil, lemon juice, garlic, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until combined.
Quarter avocado lengthwise, then peel and pit. Cut into 1/2-inch pieces and add to dressing along with carrots. Toss to combine.

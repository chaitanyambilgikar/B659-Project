Prepare marinade in a large bowl by combining lemon zest, lemon juice, garlic, vinegar, oil, olives, anchovies, red onion, bay leaf, and piment d'Espelette.
Peel and clean shrimp, leaving tails on. Partially fill a pot with water, add salt, and bring to a boil. Add shrimp and boil for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, or until shrimp pinks and the flesh looks opaque. Remove immediately. Drain and place hot shrimp into marinade. If additional liquid is needed to cover most of the shrimp, add a few tablespoons of the shrimp poaching water to the marinade. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 to 3 hours, turning the shrimp once.
Serve with avocado slices (if desired), on a salad, or by themselves as a shrimp cocktail.

Preheat the oven to 350° F. Oil and flour a ten-inch springform pan. Over the bottom piece of the pan, clamp a circle of parchment paper, which makes removing the cake easier. With an electric hand mixer, beat the eggs, sugar, and zest until pale yellow and thick, about 5 minutes. Mix in the milk and oil. Mix the flour, baking powder, and salt together and then fold the dry mixture into the liquid until thoroughly combined. Pour batter into the pan and bake for 35 to 45 minutes or until the top is golden brown and a tester inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove cake from oven, allow it to cool for 10 minutes, run a knife around the edge of the pan and remove the ring of the springmold. Cool completely and serve.

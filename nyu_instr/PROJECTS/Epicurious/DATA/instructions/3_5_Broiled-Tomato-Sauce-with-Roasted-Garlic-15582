Preheat oven to 350°F. Combine garlic and oil in small glass baking dish. Cover with foil and bake until garlic is very tender, about 40 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer garlic to work surface; reserve garlic oil. Peel garlic cloves.
Preheat broiler. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with foil. Brush foil with some of reserved garlic oil. Arrange tomatoes, cut side down, on prepared sheets. Working in batches, broil tomatoes until skins are slightly charred, watching closely to avoid burning, about 10 minutes. Cool. Remove tomato skins and discard. Place tomatoes and any juices from baking sheets in processor. Add garlic, vinegar, honey and any remaining garlic oil. Puree sauce until smooth. Transfer to bowl. Season to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 2 days ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)

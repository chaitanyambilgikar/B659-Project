Cook yuca in a medium pot of boiling salted water (2 tablespoons salt for 4 quarts water) until fork-tender, about 25 minutes (thinner pieces may need less time and can be removed with a slotted spoon). Drain yuca and cut open lengthwise, discarding any thin fibrous cores, then cut yuca into 2-inch pieces. Keep warm in a bowl, covered.
Stir together lime juice, vinegar, 3/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper until salt has dissolved. Cook onion and garlic in oil in a small skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until softened but not colored, about 4 minutes. Pour lime-juice mixture, then hot garlic oil, over yuca and toss to coat.

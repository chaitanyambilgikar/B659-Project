For Yogurt Sauce: Whisk yogurt, chopped cilantro and minced garlic in small bowl to blend. Season with salt and pepper.
For Spice Rub: Combine chopped onion, chopped garlic cloves, caraway seeds, ground coriander and cayenne pepper in bowl of processor. Process until onion and garlic are very finely chopped and past forms.
Spread spice rub on each side of swordfish steaks, dividing equally. (Yogurt sauce and spice rub-coated fish can be prepared 4 hours ahead. Cover separately and refrigerate.)
Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat) or preheat broiler. Brush grill or broiler pan and 1 tablespoon olive oil. Grill or broil swordfish steaks until fish is just cooked through, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer fish to plates. Top with dollop of yogurt sauce; garnish with lime wedges and serve.

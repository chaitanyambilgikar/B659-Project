1. Cut leeks in half lengthwise. Wash to remove dirt. Pat dry and thinly slice crosswise.
2. Heat the oil with the butter in a heavy pot over low heat. Wilt the leeks and celery with leaves until softened, 10 minutes; add garlic during the last 5 minutes.
3. Stir in the curry powder and ginger, and cook over very low heat to permeate the vegetables, 1 minute.
4. Add the broth, lemon juice, and cauliflower florets. Raise the heat to high and bring to a boil; reduce the heat and simmer, partially covered, until the cauliflower is very tender, 15 minutes. Cool slightly.
5. Purée in a food processor until very smooth, adding half-and-half through the feed tube. Add extra broth for desired consistency. Season with salt and pepper.

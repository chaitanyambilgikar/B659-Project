Cut vegetables into 1/2-inch pieces. Place in heavy medium saucepan. Add enough water to cover. Bring to boil. Cook until vegetables are tender, about 12 minutes; drain. Transfer to processor; add butter and process to coarse puree. (Alternatively, return vegetables to same pan; add butter and mash to coarse puree.) Season with nutmeg, salt and pepper and serve.

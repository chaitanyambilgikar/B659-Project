1. Heat oil in large, heavy skillet over moderately high heat for 2 minutes. Add scallions, stir-fry mix, and garlic; reduce heat to moderate and cook, stirring, until scallions are limp and excess pepper juices evaporate, 3 to 5 minutes.
2. Add caponata and broth and simmer uncovered, stirring often, just until flavors mingle, about 5 minutes.
3. Mix in basil, parsley, and salt and papper to taste. Add penne and toss lightly to coat with sauce, sprinkle with grated cheese, and serve with additional grated Parmesan.
Variation: Penne with Salsa and Cilantro
Prepare as directed, substituting 2 cups milk, medium or hot salsa for caponata, beef broth for chicken, and coarsely chopped cilantro for basil, and toss in 1/3 cup crisp bacon crumbles along with pasta.
Tips: Cook the penne while the sauce simmers. To save on dish-washing, use a skillet that's pretty enough to go to the table.

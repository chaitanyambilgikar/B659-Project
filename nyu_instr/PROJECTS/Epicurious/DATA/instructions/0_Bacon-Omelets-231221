Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 200°F.
Cook lardons in a well-seasoned 8-inch steel omelet pan or nonstick skillet over moderate heat, stirring, until well browned, about 8 minutes. Transfer to paper towels to drain and discard fat from pan.
Whisk eggs, salt, and pepper vigorously in a bowl until foamy.
Put 2 ovenproof plates in oven to warm, then heat 1/2 tablespoon butter in omelet pan over moderate heat until foam from butter subsides. Pour 1/2 cup egg mixture into pan and cook, lifting up cooked egg around edge with a heatproof rubber spatula to let raw egg flow underneath, until bottom of omelet is set but top is still runny, about 1 1/2 minutes. Scatter half of lardons over omelet, then fold omelet in half using spatula and transfer to a heated plate. Keep warm in oven.
Make another omelet in same manner, then transfer to other heated plate and serve immediately.

Preheat oven to 250°F. Place large baking sheet in oven. Stir 1 1/3 cups water, oats, and 5 tablespoons butter in heavy medium saucepan over medium-high heat until mixture comes to boil. Cook until mixture is very thick, stirring constantly, about 5 minutes. Transfer to large bowl and cool 15 minutes. Stir in flour, sugar, wheat germ, eggs, cinnamon, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg. Mix in fruit, if desired.
Heat griddle or 2 large nonstick skillets over medium-high heat. Brush with butter. Drop batter onto griddle or skillets by generous 1/2 cup for each pancake; spread batter to 4- to 5-inch rounds. Cook pancakes until brown and cooked through, about 4 minutes per side. Place on baking sheet in oven to keep warm. Repeat with remaining batter. Serve pancakes with syrup and/or yogurt.

Make cake: Position rack in center of oven and preheat oven to 350°F. Butter 9-inch-diameter cake pan with 2-inch-high sides. Sprinkle pan with 1/2 tablespoon cocoa powder; tilt pan to coat bottom and sides. Shake out excess.
Mix flour, baking powder and salt in small bowl. Stir butter and remaining 3 tablespoons cocoa in heavy small saucepan over medium-low heat until butter melts and mixture is smooth. Remove from heat.
Using electric mixer, beat eggs and sugar in large bowl until thick and fluffy. Mix in hot water and cocoa mixture. Mix in flour mixture. Stir in pecans, toffee bits and chocolate chips.
Transfer batter to prepared pan; smooth top. Bake cake until top is firm and tester inserted into center comes out with moist crumbs still attached, about 25 minutes. Cool in pan on rack 15 minutes. Run knife around pan sides to loosen cake. Turn cake out onto platter. Cool.
Make glaze: Stir chocolate, butter and honey in small saucepan over medium-low heat until mixture is smooth. Cool until mixture thickens slightly but is still pourable, about 10 minutes.
Pour glaze over top of cake, allowing some to run down sides. Spread glaze over top and sides of cake. Sprinkle top of cake with pecans and toffee bits. Chill until glaze is set, about 1 hour. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Keep chilled. Let stand at room temperature 15 minutes before serving.)

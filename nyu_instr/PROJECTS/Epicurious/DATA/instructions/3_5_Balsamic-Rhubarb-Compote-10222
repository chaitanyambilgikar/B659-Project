In a saucepan simmer vinegar with sugar and gingerroot, stirring, until sugar is dissolved and stir in rhubarb (with reserved liquid if using frozen). If using fresh rhubarb, simmer until crisp-tender, about 1 minute, and transfer with a slotted spoon to a bowl. If using frozen, as soon as mixture returns to a simmer transfer rhubarb with slotted spoon to bowl. Simmer liquid until thickened slightly, about 5 minutes, and remove pan from heat. Stir in rhubarb. Serve compote warm or at room temperature.

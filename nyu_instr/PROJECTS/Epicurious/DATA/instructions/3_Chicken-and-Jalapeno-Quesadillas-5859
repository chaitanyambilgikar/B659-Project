Preheat oven to 375°F. Brush 2 tortillas with oil. Place tortillas, oil side down, on baking sheet. Sprinkle each with 1/4 of cheese, half of chicken, half of cilantro, and 1/4 of cheese, leaving 3/4-inch border. Top each with 1 tortilla, pressing to adhere; brush top with oil.
Bake quesadillas until filling is heated through and edges begin to crisp, about 10 minutes. Using large metal spatula, turn each over and bake until bottom is crisp, about 5 minutes.
Transfer quesadillas to plates. Cut into wedges and serve.

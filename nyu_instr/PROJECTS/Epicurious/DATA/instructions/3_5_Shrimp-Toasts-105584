Pulse shrimp, ginger, sesame oil, rice wine, and egg white in a food processor until a coarse purée forms, then transfer to a bowl. Stir in jicama, cilantro, scallions, and salt and pepper to taste.
Heat 2 inches vegetable oil in a 3-quart saucepan over moderately high heat until it registers 375°F on deep-fat thermometer.
While oil is heating, divide shrimp spread among bread slices (about 2 tablespoons per slice) and spread evenly to edges. Sprinkle with sesame seeds, then gently press seeds into shrimp spread to make them stick.
Fry 2 bread slices, shrimp sides down, until shrimp is browned, about 1 minute. Turn over and fry until undersides are golden, about 30 seconds. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Fry remaining slices in same manner. Cut each toast diagonally into 2 triangles and serve immediately.

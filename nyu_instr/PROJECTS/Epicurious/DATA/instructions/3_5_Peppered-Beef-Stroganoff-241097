Sprinkle pepper melange and salt over both sides of steaks; press to adhere. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add steaks; cook to desired doneness, about 4 minutes per side for medium-rare. Transfer beef to plate; tent with foil. Add 1 tablespoon oil and mushrooms to same skillet; sauté until browned, about 4 minutes. Add broth and Cognac; boil 2 minutes. Add cream; boil until slightly thickened, about 3 minutes. Whisk in mustard.
Meanwhile, cook noodles in pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally. Drain. Return to pot; toss with parsley and 1 tablespoon oil. Season with salt and pepper. Divide among plates. Slice steaks; place atop noodles. Spoon sauce over.

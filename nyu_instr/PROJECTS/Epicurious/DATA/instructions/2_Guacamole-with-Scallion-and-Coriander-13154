Halve and pit the avocados and scoop the flesh into a bowl. Mash the avocados coarse with a fork, stir in the scallion, the coriander, the lemon juice, and salt to taste, and combine the mixture well. The guacamole may be made 1 day in advance and kept chilled, its surface covered with plastic wrap. Serve the guacamole with the tortilla chips.

Season fish with salt, pepper, cumin, and lime juice and steam in a bamboo steamer or a pot with a steamer insert until tender, about 3 minutes per side. Set aside 10 minutes to cool. Mix dressing ingredients in a small bowl. With a fork, coarsely flake the fish; toss with greens and just enough dressing to lightly coat leaves. Divide among 4 plates. Arrange avocado slices and grapefruit sections on top of each salad and drizzle lightly with dressing. Top with bean sprouts.

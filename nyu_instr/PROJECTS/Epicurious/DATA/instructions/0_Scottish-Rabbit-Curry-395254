1. In a Dutch oven, melt the butter over medium heat and sauté the rabbit pieces until well browned, about 15 minutes. Remove from the pan and reserve.
2. Using the same pan you browned the rabbit in, and without wiping it out, sauté the bacon over medium heat until it's browned and has rendered its fat in the pan, about 10 minutes. Add the flour and cook, whisking constantly, until it is dissolved, about 3 minutes. Add the curry paste and stir to combine well with the flour mixture. Stir in the chicken broth, 1/4 cup at a time. The pan contents now will have the consistency of a thin sauce.
3. Reduce the heat to medium-low and add the browned rabbit pieces along with the onions, mushrooms, celery, and salt. Simmer the dish, stirring occasionally, until the meat is cooked through, the onions are tender, and the sauce has thickened up, about 1 1/2 hours. Serve warm, preferably over rice.

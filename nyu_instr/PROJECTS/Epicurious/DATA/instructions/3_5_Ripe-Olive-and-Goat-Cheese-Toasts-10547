In a food processor chop the olives, add the goat cheese, the garlic paste, the scallion, and the Tabasco, and blend the mixture until the olives are chopped fine. Spread the mixture evenly on the toasts, arrange the toasts on a baking sheet, and broil them under a preheated broiler about 2 inches from the heat for 1 minute, or until the cheese is just melted and glistening.

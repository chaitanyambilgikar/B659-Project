Make pistou: Purée all pistou ingredients in a food processor until basil is finely chopped.
Make salad: Soak onion in cold water 15 minutes, then drain in a colander and pat dry.
While onion soaks, cook beans in a 6- to 8-quart pot of boiling salted water, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until just tender, 3 to 6 minutes, then drain in a large colander. Transfer to a large bowl of ice and cold water to stop cooking, then drain again and pat dry.
Toss beans and onion with pistou. Season with salt and pepper.

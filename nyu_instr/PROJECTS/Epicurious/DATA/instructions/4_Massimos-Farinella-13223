In a 3-quart saucepan combine spelt or barley, water, and salt to taste and simmer just until tender, 35 to 40 minutes. Drain spelt in a colander and rinse with cold water. Chill spelt 30 minutes, or until cold.
While spelt is cooking and chilling, in a bowl combine onion and vinegar and let stand at room temperature. Add chilled spelt and remaining ingredients and toss salad to combine well.

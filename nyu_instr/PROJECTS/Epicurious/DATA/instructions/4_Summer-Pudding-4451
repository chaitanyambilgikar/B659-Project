Preheat oven to 400°F. Place bread slices on baking sheet. Bake bread until slightly dry and firm, about 8 minutes. Trim crusts and discard. Arrange enough bread slices over bottom and up sides of 6- to 6 1/2-cup bowl or pudding mold to line completely; trim overhang and reserve.
Combine strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, sugar and cranberry juice cocktail in heavy large saucepan. Stir over low heat just until frozen berries thaw and sugar dissolves, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat. Ladle warm fruit and juices into bread-lines bowl. Cover fruit with reserved bread trimmings. Place small plate atop pudding; weigh down plate with cans or weights. Refrigerate overnight.
Remove weights and plate. Invert pudding onto platter. Cut into wedges and serve with sweetened whipped cream.

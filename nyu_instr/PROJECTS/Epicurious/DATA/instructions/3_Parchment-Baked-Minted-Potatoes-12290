Preheat the oven to 350°F. In a bowl stir together the butter, the mint, the shallot, the zest, and salt and pepper to taste until the mixture is combined well. Add the potatoes, trimmed and sliced as thin as possible, and toss the mixture gently to coat the potatoes well. Put the parchment paper on a work surface, fold each piece in half by bringing the short ends together, and with scissors trim the unfolded edges of each piece to form a half-heart shape. Unfold the papers, divide the potatoes among them, arranging the potatoes just to one side of the fold line, and fold the other halves of the papers over the potatoes. Beginning with a folded corner, twist and fold the edges of each paper together, forming half-heart-shaped packets, and seal the ends tightly by twisting them. Bake the packets on a baking sheet in the middle of the oven for 17 minutes. Serve the potatoes in the packets and slit the packets open at the table.

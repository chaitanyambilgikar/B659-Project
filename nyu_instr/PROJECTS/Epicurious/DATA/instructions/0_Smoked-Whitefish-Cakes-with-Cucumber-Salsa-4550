Melt 1 tablespoon butter with 1 tablespoon oil in large skillet over medium heat. Dust fish cakes with flour. Working in batches and adding more butter and oil to skillet as needed, add cakes to skillet and cook until golden, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer fish cakes to clean baking sheets. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Before serving, rewarm fish cakes in 350°F oven until heated through, about 8 minutes.)

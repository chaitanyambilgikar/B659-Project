Cut leaves from bok choy stalks, keeping leaves and stalks separate. Slice leaves thin and cut stalks diagonally into 1/2-inch-thick slices.
In a large heavy saucepan heat 1 teaspoon of each oil together over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and stir-fry bok choy stalks, carrot, and gingerroot 1 minute.
Add Scotch, broth, and sugar and simmer, covered, 5 minutes. Add bok choy leaves and scallions and simmer, covered, 3 to 5 minutes, or until tender. Season broth with salt and pepper and keep warm, uncovered.
Pat fish dry and rub cornstarch and curry powder into skin of each fish fillet. Halve each fish fillet on the diagonal.
In a 9-inch non-stick skillet heat remaining 2 teaspoons oil together over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and sauté fish, skin sides down and pressing flat occasionally with a metal spatula, until golden, about 2 minutes. Turn fish and sauté until just cooked through, about 2 minutes more.
Divide broth between 2 bowls and top with fish, skin sides up. Garnish each serving with coriander sprigs.

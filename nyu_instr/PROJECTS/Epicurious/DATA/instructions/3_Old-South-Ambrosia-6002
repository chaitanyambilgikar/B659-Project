Grate coconut in bowl. Add peeled and sectioned oranges; discard membrane and seeds. Add pineapple, fruit cocktail, apples, bananas, and nuts. Sweeten with sugar, being careful not to add too much as the syrup from the fruit is usually sufficient. Chill before serving. This dessert is pretty garnished with cherries and served in a crystal bowl.

Preheat broiler.
Diagonally cut eight 1/4-inch-thick slices from baguette with a serrated knife and arrange in one layer on a baking sheet. Brush tops of bread slices with 1 tablespoon oil and sprinkle with salt. Broil bread about 4 inches from heat, turning once, until golden, about 2 minutes. Cool toasts on a rack.
Halve garlic cloves and finely chop bell pepper. Seed tomato and finely chop.
In a small heavy saucepan cook garlic in remaining 2 tablespoons oil over moderate heat, stirring, until just golden. Discard garlic. Add bell pepper, tomato, shallot, and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring occasionally, until bell pepper is softened. Stir in vinegar and cook, stirring, until liquid is evaporated, about 5 minutes. Transfer peperonata to a bowl and cool to room temperature. Season peperonata with salt and pepper.
Spread toasts with goat cheese. Top cheese with peperonata and garnish with basil.

Quarter zucchini lengthwise. Cut off and discard seed portion in center of each zucchini spear. Cut zucchini into 1/2-inch cubes.
Heat a 12-inch non-stick skillet over moderately high heat until hot enough to make a drop of water scatter over surface. Add olive oil and heat until oil is hot but not smoking. Sauté zucchini and bell peppers with salt and pepper to taste, stirring, until just tender and beginning to turn golden, about 7 minutes.

Roast bell peppers on racks of gas burners over high heat, turning with tongs, until skins are blackened, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap, then let steam, covered, about 20 minutes.
When peppers are cool enough to handle, peel, then halve lengthwise, discarding stems and seeds. Cut peppers lengthwise into 3/4-inch-wide strips.

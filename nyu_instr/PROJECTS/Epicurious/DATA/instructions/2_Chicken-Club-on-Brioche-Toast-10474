In a small heavy skillet cook the bacon over moderate heat, turning it until it is crisp, transfer it to paper towels to drain, and pour off all but 1 tablespoon of fat from the skillet. In the fat in the skillet the chicken, patted dry and seasoned with pepper, for 6 to 8 minutes on each side, or until it is just springy to the touch, and transfer it to a work surface. Let the chicken stand for 10 minutes and cut it into thin slices. Spread one side of each brioche toast with some of the mayonnaise, sprinkle it with pepper to taste, and layer 4 of the toasts with a lettuce leaf, a tomato slice, an onion slice, and a bacon slice. Top each sandwich with a brioche toast, a lettuce leaf, an onion slice, a tomato slice, and one fourth of the chicken and cover each sandwich with a brioche toast, pressing it firmly.

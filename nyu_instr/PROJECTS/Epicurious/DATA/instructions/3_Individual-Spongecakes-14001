Preheat oven to 350° F. and line nine 1/2-cup muffin tins with paper liners.
In a double boiler or a metal bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water whisk together eggs and sugar until sugar is dissolved, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove top of double boiler or bowl from heat and with a hand-held electric mixer beat mixture at moderately high speed until doubled in volume, about 3 minutes.
Sift flour, cornstarch, and a pinch salt over egg mixture and fold in gently but thoroughly. Drizzle butter over batter and fold in gently but thoroughly.
Divide batter among muffin tins and bake in middle of oven 12 to 15 minutes, or until pale golden. Cool spongecakes in tins on a rack 10 minutes. Remove spongecakes from tins and cool completely on rack. Spongecakes may be made 1 day ahead and kept in an airtight container at room temperature.

Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350°F. Stir bittersweet chocolate and unsalted butter in large metal bowl set over saucepan of simmering water until melted and smooth. Remove bowl from over water. Mix in dark corn syrup and 3/4 cup sugar. Whisk in eggs, vanilla extract, almond extract and salt. Stir in toasted almonds.
Pour filling into prepared crust. Bake pie until filling is set around edges but moves slightly in center when pie is gently shaken and crust is golden brown, tenting pie with foil if crust browns too quickly, about 1 hour. Transfer pie to rack and cool slightly.
Serve warm or at room temperature.

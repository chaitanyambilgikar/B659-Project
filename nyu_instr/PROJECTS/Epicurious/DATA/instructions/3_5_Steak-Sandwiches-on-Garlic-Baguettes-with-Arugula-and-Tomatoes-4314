Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Mix 1 1/2 teaspoons oil and herbes de Provence in small bowl to blend. Rub oil mixture over both sides of steaks. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill steaks to desired doneness, about 8 minutes per side for medium-rare. Cool completely. Wrap steaks tightly with plastic and chill. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Keep chilled.)
Preheat broiler. Place bread, cut side up, on baking sheet. Lightly brush cut sides of bread with 1/4 cup oil. Broil until bread is golden, about 1 minute. Rub garlic halves over toasted sides of bread.
Cut meat into 1/8-inch-thick slices. Place arugula over bottoms of bread. Top with meat, then with tomatoes. Season with salt and pepper. Cover with bread tops. Cut sandwiches in half. Serve warm, or wrap with foil and chill if packing for picnic. (Can be made 2 hours ahead.)

Cut the chicken lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick slices, thread the slices lengthwise onto the skewers, and season them with salt and pepper.
Make the marinade: In a blender blend together the coconut, the gingerroot, the curry powder, the lime juice, and the hot water until the mixture is smooth, strain the mixture through a fine sieve into a bowl, pressing hard on the solids, and let the marinade cool. The marinade may be made 2 days in advance and kept covered and chilled.
In a large shallow dish pour the marinade over the chicken, coating the chicken well, and let the chicken marinate, covered and chilled, for at least 1 hour and up to 3 hours. (Do not let the chicken marinate longer or the meat will break down.)
Make the dipping sauce.
Grill the chicken with the marinade clinging to it on an oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals for 1 1/2 minutes on each side, or until it is cooked through, and serve the satés with the dipping sauce.

Rinse wild rice under cold running water and drain in a sieve. In a 1-quart heavy saucepan bring wild rice and 2 cups water to a boil and simmer, covered, 40 minutes, or until rice is tender.
While wild rice is simmering, finely chop onion. After wild rice has been simmering 20 minutes, in a 3-quart heavy saucepan bring white rice, onion, and remaining 1 1/2 cups water to a boil and simmer, covered, 13 minutes. Remove white rice from heat and let stand, covered, 5 minutes. Drain wild rice in sieve and in a bowl combine with white rice. Stir in parsley and zest with a fork, fluffing rice, and season with salt and pepper.

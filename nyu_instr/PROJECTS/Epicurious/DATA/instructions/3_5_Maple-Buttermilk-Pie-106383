Preheat oven to 325°F. Put pie shell (in pie plate) in a shallow baking pan.
Whisk together remaining ingredients in a bowl until just combined and pour three fourths of custard into shell. Carefully put pan in middle of oven and pour in remaining custard with a cup.
Bake until just set in center, about 55 minutes, then transfer pie to a rack to cool slightly. Serve warm or at room temperature.

Heat 2 tablespoons oil in medium saucepan over medium heat. Add 1 teaspoon oregano and next 3 ingredients; stir 30 seconds. Add tomatoes with juices and bring to simmer, crushing with back of fork. Reduce heat and simmer until thickened, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
Meanwhile, sprinkle steaks on both sides with salt and pepper, then crush 1/2 teaspoon oregano finely between fingertips and sprinkle over steaks. Heat 1/2 tablespoon olive oil in heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add ribeye steaks. Sauté until cooked to desired doneness, about 6 minutes per side for medium-rare.
Cut steaks into pieces and divide among 4 plates. Add sauce to skillet. Bring to simmer, scraping up browned bits; spoon sauce over steaks.

Preheat broiler. Pat chicken dry and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Heat butter in a flameproof 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until foam subsides.
Sauté chicken in butter, without turning, until cooked through and undersides are golden, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and turn chicken over, then top each cutlet with 2 spinach leaves, 1 slice ham (folding it to fit), and 1/4 cup cheese.
Broil 3 inches from heat until cheese is melted, 1 to 2 minutes.

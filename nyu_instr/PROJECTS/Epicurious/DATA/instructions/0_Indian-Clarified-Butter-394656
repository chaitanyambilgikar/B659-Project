Line a sieve with 3 layers of cheesecloth and set over a jar.
Bring butter to a boil in a small heavy saucepan over medium heat. Once foam completely covers butter, reduce heat to very low and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until a thin crust begins to form on surface and milky white solids fall to bottom of pan, about 8 minutes. Continue to cook butter, watching closely and stirring occasionally to prevent burning, until milk solids on bottom of pan are light brown and liquid is golden, translucent, and fragrant, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and strain through cheesecloth-lined sieve into jar.

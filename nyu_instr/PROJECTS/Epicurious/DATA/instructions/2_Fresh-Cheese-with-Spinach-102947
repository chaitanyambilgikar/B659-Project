Stir together turmeric, 1 1/2 cups water, and paneer and let stand 20 minutes. Drain cheese in a sieve and gently pat dry.
Cook spinach in remaining 1/2 cup water in a large saucepan, covered, over moderately high heat until wilted and tender, about 2 minutes. Coarsely purée spinach, without draining, in a food processor. Mash garlic with ginger to a paste.
Heat 6 tablespoons ghee in a large nonstick skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then brown paneer in 2 batches, gently turning to avoid breaking up and transferring to a bowl as browned. Add onions and sauté, stirring, 5 minutes. Reduce heat to moderate. Add garlic paste and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add coriander, chile powder, asafetida, and cinnamon stick and cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are tender, 4 to 6 minutes. Add tomatoes and spinach purée and simmer sauce, stirring occasionally, until thickened and almost all of liquid is evaporated, 2 to 4 minutes. Gently stir in paneer and salt to taste.

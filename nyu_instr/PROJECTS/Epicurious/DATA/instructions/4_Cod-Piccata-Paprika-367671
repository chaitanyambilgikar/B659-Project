Rinse the cod, pat dry, and slice into 4 pieces.
In a medium bowl, combine the almond flour, salt, and paprika. Coat the cod with the almond flour mixture.
Heat the olive oil and 1 tablespoon of the grapeseed oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Sauté the cod in the oil for 3 to 5 minutes per side, until golden brown. Transfer the cod to a paper towel–lined plate and place in a warm oven.
Using the same skillet, combine the chicken stock, lemon juice, and olives, loosening the browned bits with a spatula to incorporate into the sauce. Raise the heat to high and reduce the sauce by half. Whisk in the remaining 3 tablespoons grapeseed oil.
Pour the sauce over the cod, and sprinkle with parsley before serving.

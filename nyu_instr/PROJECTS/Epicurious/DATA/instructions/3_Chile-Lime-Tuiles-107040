Bring sugar, butter, and corn syrup to a boil in a 1-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat, stirring, then boil 1 minute. Remove from heat and stir in remaining ingredients until smooth. Cool dough to room temperature.
Preheat oven to 350°F. Place wooden spoons parallel to each other 2 inches apart on a metal rack.
Roll a level teaspoon of dough into a ball, then into a log. Arrange 3 logs about 3 inches apart on a parchment-lined baking sheet, then pinch and stretch each to form an 8- to 9-inch-long strip (about 1/8 inch wide).
Bake in middle of oven until flat and golden, 7 to 9 minutes. While first sheet is baking, form remaining strips on more sheets of parchment. Slide parchment paper with baked cookies from sheet to a rack and cool cookies 30 seconds. Working quickly, slide a long thin metal spatula under each cookie and drape across spoon handles to form a wavy shape. (If cookies harden on paper before being draped, slide them back onto hot baking sheet for a moment to soften.) Bake and drape remaining cookies in same manner.

About 30 minutes before baking the pizza, preheat the oven to 500° or 550°F.
Place the cheese in a small bowl and add the garlic. (If using goat cheese, add a spoonful or two of cream or milk to make it spreadable.) Mash the cheese and garlic until blended.
Using a rolling pin, roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to an 8- to 9-inch circle. With a fork, pierce the dough all over the top. Dust a pizza peel or the back of a baking sheet with flour. Place the dough on the peel, shaking it once or twice to make sure it does not stick. If it does, lift the dough and dust the peel with more flour.
When the dough is browned underneath and slightly puffed, remove it from the oven and place it on a cutting board. Protect one hand with an oven mitt while you split the dough into 2 layers with a serrated knife. Remove the top layer and spread the bottom with the cheese mixture. Replace the top and press it lightly. Slide the pizza back into the oven for 2 minutes more, or until the top is lightly browned.
Remove the pizza from the oven and drizzle with truffle oil, if using. Cut and serve.

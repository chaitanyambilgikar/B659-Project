Combine meat with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper; mix well. Trim zucchini at both ends and cut into three parts each; then cut each part lengthwise into four sections. Take one of these sections with a bit of ground meat and press the two together forming a small oval ball. Roll it in flour and set aside on a piece of wax paper. Continue to make balls until you have used up zucchini sections and meat.
Heat 1 cup of oil in a large frying pan. Dip floured zucchini balls in the beaten egg and fry in the hot oil until golden on all sides. Remove to paper towel to drain. When all balls are fried, transfer to a large skillet where they can fit, preferably, in a single layer. Add garlic and parsley.
Dilute tomato paste with 2 cups cold water and add to skillet. Simmer for 15 or 20 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons oil, salt and pepper to taste, and cook another couple of minutes to bring the flavors together.

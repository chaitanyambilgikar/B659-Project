In a large glass bowl make separate layers with the cabbage, the onions, the bell peppers, and the peas. In a bowl whisk together the yogurt,the mayonnaise, the capers, the thyme, and salt and pepper to taste, pour the dressing over the peas, spreading it evenly, and chill the salad, covered, for 6 hours. The salad may be made 1 day in advance and kept covered and chilled. Combine the salad well and serve it with additional salt and pepper to taste.

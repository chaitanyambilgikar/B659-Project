Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add ras-el-hanout, if using, and curry powder; reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring often, until fragrant, 2-3 minutes. Add carrots; cook, stirring often, until still slightly firm to the bite, 6-7 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add broth; simmer until all liquid is absorbed and carrots are tender, 6-7 minutes longer.

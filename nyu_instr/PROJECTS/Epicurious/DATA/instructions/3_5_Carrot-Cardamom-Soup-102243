Heat the olive oil in a large nonreactive stockpot over medium heat. Add the onion, ginger, spice blend, carrots, red pepper, and potatoes. Stir to coat the vegetables with the spices and then sauté until the onion is translucent and the vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes.
Add the chicken stock, white wine, and brown sugar. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until the vegetables are tender, 30 to 40 minutes. Remove from the heat.
Transfer the mixture, in batches, to a blender or food processor and process until smooth. Return the soup to the pot and reheat over low heat. Stir in the lime juice and parsley; add the butter and salt and pepper, and heat until the butter is melted. Serve in individual bowls, each garnished with a lime slice.

Preheat oven to 300 degrees. Oil a large piece of baking parchment on a baking sheet. Put the egg whites, sugar, vinegar, and hot water into the bowl of a food mixer and whisk at the highest speed for 5 minutes until soft, white peaks form. Spoon the mixture into an 8 inch round on the oiled paper -- or spoon 4 high rounds on the paper to make the individual pavlovas. Cook in the center of the oven for about one hour and ten minutes, until crisp. (The individual pavlovas will take less time, about 1 hour) Allow to cool on wire rack.
To make the passionfruit curd, put all the ingredients into a bowl set over a pan of simmering water and stir constantly until the mixture starts to thicken and take on the appearance of a thin custard. Continue to cook, still stirring, until it thickens further, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat immediately so as not to overcook. Ladle the curd into a clean jar or container, and leave to cool before covering and refrigerating.
To serve, whip the cream into soft peaks and place onto the pavlova base spreading out to the edges with a palette knife. For the individual pavlovas, place a spoonful of cream on top of each pavlova. Pour the passionfruit curd over the top.

Put bread slices, cut sides down, on a work surface and make a horizontal lengthwise opening in each by cutting to within 1/4 inch of opposite side. Spread 1 tablespoon cranberry sauce in each opening and gently press closed.
In a flat-bottomed dish just large enough to hold bread slices in one layer whisk together eggs, milk, and a pinch salt. Add stuffed bread slices and soak, turning once or twice, until custard is absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes.
In a 9-to 10-inch non-stick skillet heat butter over moderate heat until foam subsides and cook bread slices 5 to 7 minutes on each side, or until golden and crisp. Transfer French toast with a slotted spatula to paper towels to drain briefly and sprinkle lightly with sugar.
Serve French toast with maple syrup.

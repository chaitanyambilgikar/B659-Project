For crust Combine flour, sugar and salt in processor. Add butter and cut in using on/off turns until mixture resembles coarse meal. Blend in enough water by tablespoons to form moist clumps. Gather dough into ball. Flatten into disk. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate until firm enough to roll, about 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 400°F. Roll out dough on lightly floured surface to 12-inch round. Transfer to 9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom. trim overhang to 1/2 inch (reserve dough scraps). Fold overhang in; press dough firmly to create double-thick sides. Freeze crust 10 minutes.
Line crust with foil. Fill crust with dried beans or pie weights. Bake until crust sets, about 25 minutes. Remove foil and beans and bake crust until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Transfer crust to rack and cool completely. Gently cover any cracks in crust with small bits of reserved dough and press lightly to smooth. (Can be prepared 6 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.)
For Filling: Preheat oven to 400°F. Mix sugar and cornstarch in medium bowl. Add 3 eggs, whipping cream and dessert wine and whisk until filling is well blended. Place crust on baking sheet. Pour filling into crust. Bake until filling sets and top browns, about 20 minutes. Transfer tart to rack and cool 15 minutes.

1. Preheat the oven to 400°F. Place the potatoes on a baking sheet and bake in the center of the oven and bake until they are tender, about 30 minutes.
2. While the potatoes are baking, mince the chervil and fold it into the crème fraîche. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
3. When the potatoes are baked, remove them from the oven and split each one down the center. Gently push the ends of the potatoes together to open them up, and season them inside with salt and pepper, and a large dollop of crème fraîche. Serve the remaining crème fraîche alongside.

Lasagna: Preheat oven to 325°F. Place a double layer of butternut squash in the bottom of a 12" baking pan that's been greased with butter and sprinkled with salt and pepper. Season squash with salt and pepper to taste and top with 2 tbsp shallots, garlic, and thyme. Layer remaining vegetables individually, seasoning each layer with shallots, garlic, thyme, salt, and pepper. Dot top with butter, sprinkle with salt and freshly ground pepper to taste. Bake 1 1/2 to 2 hours or until you can easily pierce vegetables with a knife. Remove from oven and let rest at least 15 minutes before serving.
Broth: In a medium pot, combine mushrooms, vinegar, soy sauce, and 5 cups water and bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Lower heat and simmer 30 minutes. Strain broth through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl. Melt butter in a saucepan and whisk into broth. Salt and pepper to taste, whisk again and pour over lasagna.

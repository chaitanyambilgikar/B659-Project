Cut enough kernels from cobs to measure 2 1/2 cups. In a food processor pulse corn until coarsely chopped and slightly wet. Melt butter and cool. In a bowl whisk together butter, eggs, and milk. Coarsely grate mozzarella and in a large bowl stir together with corn, flour, cornmeal, salt, and pepper. Whisk in egg mixture until combined.
In a 12-inch nonstick skillet heat 1 tablespoon oil over moderate heat until hot but not smoking. Working in batches, drop 1/8-cup measures of batter into skillet to form pancakes about 2 inches in diameter (do not spread or flatten pancakes) and cook until edges begin to set and undersides are golden brown, about 1 1/2 minutes. Flip pancakes and cook until undersides are golden brown and pancakes are cooked through. Add more oil to skillet as necessary between batches. Pancakes may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered. Reheat pancakes in middle of a 350°F. oven until hot, about 15 minutes.

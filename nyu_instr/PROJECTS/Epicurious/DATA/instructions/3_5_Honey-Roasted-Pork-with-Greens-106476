Place pork, fat side up, in large glass baking dish. Rub pork with salt and pepper. Whisk honey, 4 tablespoons lemon juice, 4 tablespoons olive oil, coriander, and thyme in small bowl. Pour over pork; cover pork loosely with foil. Let stand at room temperature 1 hour, basting occasionally.
Preheat oven to 375°F. Transfer pork to roasting pan; reserve marinade. Roast pork 15 minutes. Spoon 1/4 of reserved marinade over pork. Add 1/4 cup broth to roasting pan. Roast pork 15 minutes; spoon remaining marinade over. Add 1/4 cup broth to pan. Roast until instant-read thermometer inserted into center of pork registers 150°F, about 40 minutes longer. Add 1/4 cup broth to pan, stirring browned bits from bottom.
Transfer pork to platter; tent with foil. Strain pan juices into 1-cup measuring cup; add enough broth to measure 1 cup liquid. Pour into small saucepan; keep warm over low heat. Heat remaining 3 tablespoons oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chard and toss to coat. Cover and cook until chard is tender, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Mix in remaining lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper. Spread greens on platter. Slice pork and arrange atop greens. Pour pan juices over.

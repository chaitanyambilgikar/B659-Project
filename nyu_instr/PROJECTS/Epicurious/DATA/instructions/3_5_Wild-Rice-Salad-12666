In a large saucepan bring 5 cups salted water to a boil. Add wild rice and cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 40 minutes. Drain wild rice and transfer to a bowl to cool. (Chill wild rice, covered, until cold, about 2 hours.)
In a large bowl combine vegetables, almonds, and raisins and toss with wild rice.
In a bowl whisk together vinegar, oil, garlic, and salt and pepper to taste until combined well. Pour dressing over salad and toss well. (Salad may be made 2 days ahead and chilled, covered.)

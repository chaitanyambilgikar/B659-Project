Pour enough oil into large saucepan to reach depth of 1 inch; heat to 350°F. Working in batches, add 4 to 5 sage leaves at a time to oil and fry until bright green and crisp, about 15 seconds per batch (do not brown or leaves will taste bitter). Using slotted spoon, transfer sage to paper towels to drain (leaves will darken slightly as they cool). Sprinkle lightly with salt. Set aside.
Cook potatoes in large pot of boiling salted water until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain well. Return potatoes to pot. Add butter and 1 1/3 cups milk; mash until smooth, thinning with milk if desired. Stir in dried sage. Season with salt and pepper.
Transfer potatoes to large bowl. Garnish with a few fried sage leaves; serve remaining fried sage leaves alongside.

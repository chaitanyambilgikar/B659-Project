In a bowl whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt.
In a blender or food processor blend milk, sour cream, egg, and 1/2 cup scallion until smooth. Add mixture to flour mixture and stir remaining 1/2 cup scallion until combined well.
In a large non-stick skillet heat oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and, working in 2 batches, drop batter by tablespoonfuls into skillet. Spread batter into cakes about 2 inches in diameter and cook 2 to 3 minutes on each side, or until golden. Transfer griddlecakes as cooked with a metal spatula to a heatproof plate and keep warm. Makes about 8 griddlecakes, serving 2 as a side dish.

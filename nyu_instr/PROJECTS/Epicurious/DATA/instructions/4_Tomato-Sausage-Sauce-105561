Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add sausages, onion, and garlic. Sauté until onion begins to color, about 10 minutes. Add crushed tomatoes and herbs and bring sauce to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until flavors blend and sausages are cooked through, stirring often, about 30 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Slice sausages thinly, if desired.

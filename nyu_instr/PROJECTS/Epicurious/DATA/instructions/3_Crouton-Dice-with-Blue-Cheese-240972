Preheat oven to 400°F with rack in middle.
Trim crusts from loaf, then cut loaf into 1-inch cubes. Put cubes in a large shallow baking pan and drizzle with melted butter, gently tossing to coat. Arrange cubes in 1 layer and bake, turning occasionally, until pale golden and crisp around edges but still soft inside, 12 to 20 minutes. Cool croutons slightly in pan on a rack, then poke a hole three fourths of the way through each cube from top using large end of chopstick, making hole about 1/3 inch in diameter. Press about 1/2 teaspoon cheese into each hole, mounding slightly.
Just before serving, reheat croutons, cheese side up, in baking pan in a 400°F oven until warm and crisp, about 5 minutes.

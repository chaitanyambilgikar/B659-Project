Preheat oven to 325°F.
Whisk together yolks, granulated sugar, and salt in a bowl until combined well. Using tip of a knife, scrape seeds from vanilla bean into cream in a 2-quart saucepan, then add pod. Heat over moderate heat until hot but not boiling. Discard pod and add cream to egg mixture in a slow stream, whisking until combined.
Spoon 1/4 cup mango into each ramekin. Pour custard through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, then ladle over mango. Arrange ramekins in a roasting pan and bake in a hot water bath in middle of oven until custards are just set, 35 to 40 minutes. Transfer custards with tongs to a rack to cool, then chill, uncovered, at least 4 hours.
Preheat broiler.
Sprinkle turbinado sugar evenly over custards and broil in a shallow baking pan 5 to 7 inches from heat until sugar is caramelized, 2 to 3 minutes.

Stir over medium heat until custard thickens and boils and leaves path on back of spoon when finger is drawn across, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Add chocolate and whisk until melted. Stir in almonds. Transfer custard to large bowl. Freeze until cold but not firm, stirring occasionally, about 45 minutes.

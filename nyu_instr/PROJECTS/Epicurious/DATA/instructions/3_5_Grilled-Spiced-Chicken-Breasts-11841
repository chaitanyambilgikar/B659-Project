In an electric spice grinder or blender grind fine coriander seeds, bay leaves, peppercorns, and cloves. Pat chicken dry and rub ground spices and salt all over it. Grill chicken on an oiled rack 4 inches above glowing coals 5 minutes on each side, or until cooked through. Alternatively, grill chicken in a preheated well-seasoned ridged grill pan.
Serve chicken with Creole sauce and garnish with thyme sprigs.

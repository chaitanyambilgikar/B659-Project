In a large nonstick pan, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add onion and garlic; cook, stirring, until soft, 2 to 3 minutes. Add bell pepper; cook until crisp-tender, 3 minutes. Move veggies to side of pan. Season beef with salt and black pepper; add to pan. Add Worcestershire and cook beef through, 3 minutes. Remove pan from heat; stir in cheese, mixing beef and veggies together. Divide mixture among bottom slices of bread; cover with top slices.

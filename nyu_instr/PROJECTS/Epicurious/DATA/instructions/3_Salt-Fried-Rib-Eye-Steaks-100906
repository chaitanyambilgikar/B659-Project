Pat steaks dry. Sprinkle salt evenly in bottom of a well-seasoned 10-inch cast-iron skillet. Heat skillet over moderately high heat until faint wisps of smoke are visible and fry steaks, shaking skillet after 1 or 2 minutes to loosen them from bottom, 6 minutes. Turn steaks over and fry 5 minutes more for medium-rare. Transfer steaks to a cutting board and let stand 5 minutes before slicing.

1. Preheat oven to 350°F.
2. Heat the oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion. Sauté for 3 minutes, then add the garlic and cook until the onion is translucent, about 2 minutes more.
3. Add the tomatoes and oregano. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, in a blender, process the tofu, egg, nutmeg, salt, and pepper until smooth.
4. Transfer the mixture to a bowl and fold in the spinach, cooked rigatoni, tomato sauce, 1 cup of the mozzarella, and 1/2 cup of the Parmesan.
5. Drizzle a coating of olive oil into a 13-by-9-inch baking pan. Add the pasta mixture and sprinkle the remaining cheeses over the top. Bake until golden and bubbling, 35 to 40 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes before slicing.

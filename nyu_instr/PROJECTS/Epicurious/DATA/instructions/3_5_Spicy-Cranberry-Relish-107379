Finely grate 1 teaspoon zest from lime, then squeeze enough juice to measure 2 tablespoons.
Pulse cranberries with zest, juice, onion, sugar, and chile to taste in a food processor until finely chopped. Chill relish, covered, stirring occasionally, at least 2 hours (to allow flavors to develop) and up to 1 week.

Line muffin cups and lightly spray liners with cooking spray.
Melt chocolate in a metal bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water, stirring occasionally, until smooth. Spoon a scant teaspoon chocolate into each cup and use paintbrush to coat bottoms and sides evenly. Freeze cups until chocolate is firm, about 5 minutes, then repaint any thin spots, especially around top edges, with some of remaining chocolate and refreeze until firm, about 5 minutes.
Spoon remaining melted chocolate into a small sealable plastic bag, pressing out excess air. Twist bag firmly just above chocolate and set aside.
Working in 3 batches, scoop about 1 1/2 tablespoons ice cream into each cup and gently press into cups with a small offset spatula or back of a spoon to fill cups evenly. (You will have some ice cream left over.) Refreeze cups to firm ice cream, at least 5 minutes. Sprinkle cups with peanuts, then snip off a minuscule portion of 1 bottom corner of plastic bag with scissors to form a very small opening and decoratively pipe remaining chocolate over peanuts. Freeze desserts until chocolate and ice cream harden, at least 30 minutes. Remove petits fours from freezer 1 at a time and carefully peel off liners, then refreeze on a tray until hardened, about 30 minutes more.

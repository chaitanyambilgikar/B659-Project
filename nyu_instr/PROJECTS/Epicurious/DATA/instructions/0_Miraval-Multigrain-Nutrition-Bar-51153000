PREHEAT the oven to 350° F. Lightly grease an 8" by 8" baking sheet or cake pan with vegetable cooking spray and set aside.
SPREAD the oats, nuts, and flaxseed meal on a sheet pan and bake until very light golden brown and fragrant, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl.
BRING the water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Remove from the heat and add the 7-grain cereal; set aside until the water is absorbed, 2 minutes. Add the peanut butter and honey, stir well, and place over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture is thick and glossy and pulls away from the sides of the pan, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes.
SPOON the fruit and salt into the hot peanut-butter mixture and immediately pour into the bowl with the grains. With a large rubber spatula, work the peanut butter-fruit mixture into the grains until evenly coated. (The mixture will become very sticky; it may be necessary to work the mixture with your hands.)
TRANSFER the mixture to the prepared pan, working it out to the edges with your fingers and pressing to a uniform 1/2-inch thickness. Refrigerate until firm, at least 2 hours.
CUT the cooled cake into bars measuring 1 1/2" by 1 1/4" and serve immediately, or wrap individually in plastic wrap. (The bars will keep room temperature for up to two days, and refrigerated for up yo four days.)

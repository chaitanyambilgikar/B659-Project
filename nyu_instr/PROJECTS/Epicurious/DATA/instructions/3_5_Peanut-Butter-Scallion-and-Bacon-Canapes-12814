In a small bowl stir together the peanut butter, the scallions, the lemon juice, the soy sauce, 1 tablespoon of the mayonnaise, and the brown sugar. Spread the bread slices lightly with the additional mayonnaise, spread the peanut butter mixture on the slices, and cut the slices into quarters. Arrange the canapés on a baking sheet, put a piece of bacon on top of each canapé, and bake the canapés in the middle of a preheated 425°F. oven for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the bacon is crisp.

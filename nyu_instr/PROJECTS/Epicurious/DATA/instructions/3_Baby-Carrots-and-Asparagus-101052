Trim carrot tops to 1/8 inch and diagonally cut asparagus into 4-inch lengths. In a large saucepan of boiling salted water cook carrots until crisp-tender, about 4 minutes, and transfer with a slotted spoon to a colander to drain. Return water to a boil and cook asparagus until crisp-tender, about 2 minutes. Drain asparagus in colander with carrots and in a bowl toss vegetables with butter and salt and pepper to taste.

Mix mint, oregano, and garlic in small bowl. Sprinkle lamb generously with salt and coarsely ground pepper. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons herb mixture over lamb chops; press to adhere (reserve remaining herb mixture for compote).
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add lamb and cook to desired doneness, about 4 minutes per side for medium. Transfer lamb to platter (do not clean skillet). Tent lamb with foil. Reduce heat to medium. Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil to skillet. Add onion and sauté until beginning to soften, about 2 minutes. Add vinegar and reserved herb mixture; sauté 1 minute. Season compote to taste with salt and pepper. Spoon compote over lamb and serve.

Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350°F.
Toast hazelnuts in a shallow baking pan in oven, shaking pan occasionally, until golden, about 10 minutes. Cool slightly, then rub off any loose skins with a kitchen towel. When nuts are cool enough to handle, coarsely chop.
Turn on broiler.
Cook wheat berries in a 4-quart pot of unsalted boiling water, partially covered, until tender, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Drain well in a large sieve.
While wheat berries cook, broil bell peppers on a baking sheet or broiler pan 4 to 5 inches from heat, turning occasionally with tongs, until skins are blackened in spots, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer to a bowl, then cover and let steam 10 minutes. Peel peppers, discarding stems and seeds, and cut into 1-inch pieces.
Mince and mash garlic to a paste with a pinch of salt using a large heavy knife. Transfer garlic paste to a large bowl and add vinegar, salt, and pepper. Add oil in a steady stream, whisking, then whisk until combined well. Add wheat berries, hazelnuts, bell peppers, chicken, and arugula and toss gently to combine. Serve salad at room temperature.

Bring first seven ingredients to a simmer in a small saucepan. Place radishes in a heatproof container; pour vinegar mixture over. Chill for at least 5 hours and up to 1 week.
Before serving, add cucumber; let sit for 25–30 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl; stir in onion and olive oil. Season with salt and pepper.

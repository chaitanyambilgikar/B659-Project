In a saucepan bring water and sugar to a boil, stirring until sugar is dissolved. In a heatproof bowl pour syrup over mint and steep 5 minutes. Strain mixture through a fine sieve into a pitcher, discarding mint, and stir in lemon juice. Chill syrup, covered, at least until cold and up to 1 week.
Arrange fruit on a large platter and garnish with mint sprigs. Serve syrup on the side.

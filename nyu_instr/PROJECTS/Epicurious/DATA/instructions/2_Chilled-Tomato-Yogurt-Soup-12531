In a food processor or blender purée the tomatoes in batches, force the purée through a fine sieve set over a bowl, and whisk in the yogurt, the curry powder, the basil, and salt and pepper to taste. Chill the soup, covered, until it is cold. (The soup may be made 1 day in advance and kept covered and chilled).

1 Preheat oven to 450°F.
2 Rub the meat with the oil, salt, and pepper. Place it in a baking pan and roast for 30 minutes, turning it once halfway through.
3 Reduce heat to 350°F. Add the enchilada sauce, beer, and 1 cup of the broth. Cover with foil and cook for 2 1/2 hours, adding more broth as the liquid evaporates.
4 Add the potatoes, squash, and hominy. Cook for 30 minutes more.
5 Uncover and cook until the vegetables are tender and the juices are slightly thickened, 15 minutes.
6 Carve the meat across the grain; serve it all drizzled with sauce.

Combine 2 cups water and dried cherries in large saucepan. Bring to boil. Reduce heat; simmer until water is reduced to 1/4 cup, about 15 minutes. Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add bean. Stir in dark cherries with juices and remaining ingredients. Simmer until cherries are tender and juices thicken, about 50 minutes. Cool. (Can be made 3 days ahead. Cover and chill. Serve at room temperature.)

Combine thyme, orange peel, garlic, salt, and pepper in small bowl. Open lamb on rimmed baking sheet. Using small sharp knife, make twelve 1/2-inch-deep slits on each side of lamb. Fill each slit with 1/2 teaspoon thyme mixture. Rub any remaining thyme mixture over both sides of lamb. Brush lamb lightly with olive oil. (Can be prepared ahead. Let stand 2 hours at room temperature or cover and refrigerate up to 1 day.)
Preheat broiler. Broil lamb 4 inches from heat source until brown and crusty and meat thermometer inserted into thickest part registers 125°F to 130°F for medium-rare, about 8 minutes per side. Transfer lamb to platter. Let stand 15 minutes. Slice thinly across grain.

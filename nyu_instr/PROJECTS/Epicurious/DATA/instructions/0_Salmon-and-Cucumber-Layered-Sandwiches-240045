Flake 1 1/2 pounds freshly poached salmon filet into small pieces. Place in a bowl and mix with 2 tablespoons freshly chopped chives, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, and 4 tablespoons sour cream. Season with kosher salt and freshly ground pepper.
Peel 1 large English cucumber and halve it the long way. Using a mandoline, cut it into long, thin slices about 1/8 inch thick; set aside. Discard the center with the seeds. Wash and dry a handful of mustard lettuce leaves.
Butter 1 slice of thin-sliced pumpernickel, onion, or plain white bread. Arrange a single layer of cucumber on it, then top with a flat layer of lettuce. Butter another slice of bread on both sides and place it on top. Top with the salmon, spreading well, but no more than 1/3 inch thick. Butter a final slice of bread and place it over the salmon, butter side down, pressing gently. Using a serrated knife, remove the crusts and slice into rectangles, about 1 1/2 inches wide by 3 inches long. Repeat with another 9 slices of bread.

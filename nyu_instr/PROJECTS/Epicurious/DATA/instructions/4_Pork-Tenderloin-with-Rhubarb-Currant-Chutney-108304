Bring first 6 ingredients to boil in heavy medium saucepan over high heat, stirring until sugar dissolves. Reduce heat to low and simmer 5 minutes. Increase heat to medium-high. Add rhubarb and currants; bring to boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer gently until rhubarb is tender, about 5 minutes. Season chutney with salt. (Chutney can be made 3 days ahead. Cool slightly. Cover and refrigerate. Rewarm before using.)

Grill pork until thermometer inserted into thickest part registers 150°F, turning occasionally, about 20 minutes. Using tongs, transfer pork to cutting board; let pork rest 10 minutes. Cut pork into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Serve with chutney.

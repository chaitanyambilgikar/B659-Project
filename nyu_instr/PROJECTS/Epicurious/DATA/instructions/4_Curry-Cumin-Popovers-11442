With a mortar and pestle or in an electric coffee or spice grinder coarse 1/4 teaspoon cumin seeds.
Preheat oven to 375°F. Generously grease six 2/3-cup popover tins or nine 1/2-cup muffin tins.
In a bowl whisk together eggs, milk, and water and add butter in a stream, whisking. Add flour and salt and whisk mixture until combined well but still slightly lumpy, whisking ground cumin seeds and curry powder into batter. Divide batter among tins, sprinkle whole cumin seeds over popovers and bake in lower third of oven 45 minutes. Cut a slit about 1/2 inch long on top of each popover with a small sharp knife and bake 10 minutes more.

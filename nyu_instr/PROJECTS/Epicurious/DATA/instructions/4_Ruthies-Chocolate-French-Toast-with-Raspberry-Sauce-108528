Make sauce: Purée raspberries, lemon juice, and 1/2 cup confectioners sugar in a food processor. Sweeten with confectioners sugar to taste (up to 1/4 cup more). Force through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, discarding seeds.
Make French toast: Whisk together eggs, milk, vanilla, sugar, and salt in a large shallow dish until mixture is combined well and sugar and salt are dissolved.
Melt 1 1/2 tablespoons butter in a 12-inch heavy nonstick skillet or griddle over moderately high heat. Dip 2 bread slices briefly in egg mixture until lightly soaked, turning once if necessary. Transfer to skillet, without crowding, and reduce heat to moderate. Sprinkle each slice with one fourth of chocolate and top with 2 more slices of egg-dipped bread. Press sandwiches gently with a spatula to help slices adhere. Cook, turning sandwiches over once, until chocolate is melted and French toast is browned and cooked through, about 10 minutes total. Transfer to a plate and keep warm, covered. Wipe out skillet and make 2 more sandwiches in same manner.
Cut French toast in half diagonally and serve with sauce.

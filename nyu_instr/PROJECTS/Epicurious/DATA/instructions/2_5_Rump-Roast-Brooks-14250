Season roast with salt and pepper. Press garlic all over roast and wrap well in plastic wrap. Chill roast at least 12 hours and up 10 1 day.
Preheat oven to 350°F. Let roast stand at room temperature 30 minutes.
While roast is standing, in a large saucepan simmer onions in water, covered, until tender, about 20 minutes. Pour mixture through a large sieve into a bowl, pressing on solids, and reserve onion broth.
Unwrap roast and discard garlic. Dredge toast completely with 1/3 cup flour, shaking off any excess flour. In a large Dutch oven heat shortening over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and brown roast on all sides. Add 1/2 cup reserved onion broth and braise, covered, in oven, turning roast every 40 minutes, 2 hours. Add 2 cups onion broth and braise, covered, 45 minutes to 1 hour more, or until roast is very tender.
Transfer roast to a cutting board, reserving braising liquid in Dutch oven, and let stand, covered loosely, while making gravy. In a small bowl stir together with a fork remaining 2 tablespoons flour and 1/3 cup onion broth until smooth. Bring reserved braising liquid to a boil and add flour mixture in a stream, stirring until smooth. Simmer gravy until thickened, adding enough onion broth to thin to desired consistency.
Serve rump roast with gravy.

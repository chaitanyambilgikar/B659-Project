Blend 1/4 cup garlic, 1 teaspoon salt, and 2 tablespoons oil in a blender at high speed until smooth and creamy.
Add 1 egg or 2 yolks and, with motor running, very slowly add 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons oil in a thin, steady stream until aïoli is thick. This will take about 2 minutes.
Transfer to a bowl. Make second batch with remaining ingredients.

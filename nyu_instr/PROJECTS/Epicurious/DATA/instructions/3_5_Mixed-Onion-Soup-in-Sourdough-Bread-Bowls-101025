Preheat oven to 350°F. Cut 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch off top of bread loaves. Scoop out bread, leaving 1/2-inch-thick shell. Generously brush inside of bread bowls and lids with melted butter. Place bread bowls and lids, buttered side up, directly on oven rack; bake until crisp, about 20 minutes. Remove from oven; set aside.
Melt 1/4 cup butter in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add white onions, leeks, red onions, garlic and shallot to pot. Cook until vegetables are dark brown, stirring occasionally, about 25 minutes. Add flour and stir 1 minute. Gradually mix in Sherry. Boil mixture until very thick, scraping up browned bits, about 5 minutes. Gradually mix in stock; add thyme and rosemary and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 30 minutes. Add cream; simmer until slightly thickened, about 15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Place 1 bread bowl on each plate. Place bread lid alongside. Ladle soup into bread bowls and serve.

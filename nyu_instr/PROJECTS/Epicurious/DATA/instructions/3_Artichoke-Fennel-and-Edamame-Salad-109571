Preheat oven to 400°F. Fill medium bowl with cold water. Add 2 tablespoons lemon juice. Working with 1 artichoke at a time, pull off tough outer leaves (about 3 rows). Cut tip and stem off artichoke. Cut artichoke in half. Scoop out any choke. Place in lemon water.
Spray large rimmed baking sheet with nonstick spray. Drain artichokes; pat dry. Return to bowl. Add 3 tablespoons oil and toss. Transfer to prepared sheet; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Roast until tender when pierced, stirring once, about 20 minutes. Cool on sheet.
Whisk 6 tablespoons lemon juice, 1/2 cup oil, shallots, fennel seeds, and lemon peel in large bowl. Stir in sliced fennel, parsley, artichokes, and edamame. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.) Garnish with reserved fennel fronds and serve.
*Edamame (soybeans) are available at many supermarkets.

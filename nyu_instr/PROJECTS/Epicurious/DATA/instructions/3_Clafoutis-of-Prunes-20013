Soak the prunes and raisins in sherry or port for 8 hours.
Beat the eggs well and add the sugar, salt and flour-baking-powder mixture. Blend with the milk and flavor with some of the wine in which the fruits have soaked, or with cognac. Arrange the fruit in a buttered 10" baking dish and top with the batter. Bake in a 375°F. oven for 30-35 minutes, or until set.

Preheat oven to 375°F. Wrap beets in foil. Bake until tender, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Unwrap and cool slightly. Peel beets and cut into 3/4-inch cubes. Place in small bowl.
Cook potatoes in large pot of boiling water until tender. Drain. Transfer to large bowl. Add 2 tablespoons vinegar; stir gently with rubber spatula. Cool.
Add cucumber to potatoes. Mix 2 teaspoons vinegar, mustard and sugar in small bowl. Gradually whisk in oil. Add minced dill and caraway. Toss beets with just enough dressing to coat. Mix remaining dressing into potatoes. Season mixture with salt and pepper. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.)
Just before serving, gently mix beets into potato salad. Line platter with lettuce; top with salad. Garnish with dill.

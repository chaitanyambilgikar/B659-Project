Preheat broiler.
Mince and mash garlic to a paste with a pinch of salt, then stir together with rosemary, oil, 3/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Rub mixture all over chops.
Broil chops on a broiler pan about 4 inches from heat, turning once, until just cooked through, about 8 minutes total. Let stand 5 minutes.

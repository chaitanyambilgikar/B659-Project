Peel half the potatoes, grate them coarse (preferably in a food processor), and press them between several thicknesses of paper towel to remove any excess moisture. In a large heavy skillet heat 1/4 cup of the oil over moderately high heat until it is hot but not smoking. In a bowl toss the grated potatoes with salt and pepper to taste, form them into 4 patties, and in the skillet cook the patties, tamping them down with a spatula, for 5 minutes on each side, or until the pancakes are golden brown and cooked through. Transfer the pancakes to paper towels to drain and keep them warm in a 200°F. oven. Make 4 more pancakes in the same manner with the remaining potatoes and oil and serve the pancakes with the smoked salmon and the sour cream.

Peel and chop garlic. Place in small bowl. Mix in cream cheese and all olives.
Drain cucumber salad. Spread 1/4 of cream cheese mixture on cut side of each of 4 pita halves. Spoon 1/2 cup salad over each. Sprinkle both cheeses atop salad. Cover with remaining 4 pita halves.
Heat medium skillet over medium heat. Butter sides of each pita. Working in batches, cook quesadillas in skillet until cheese melts, about 3 minutes per side. Garnish with peppers. Cut into wedges.

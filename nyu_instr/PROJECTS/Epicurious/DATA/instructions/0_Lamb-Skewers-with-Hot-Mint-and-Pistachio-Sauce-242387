1. Cut the lamb into 1 inch cubes. Place in a Ziploc bag and add the rest of the ingredients. Seal and let marinate in the refrigerator for at least an hour.
2. Turn your oven to broil and skewer the cubes on the chopsticks. If the chopsticks are not lacquered then place them in water for an hour before use, so they won't char in the oven.
3. Grill the skewers in the top of your oven for about 12 minutes or until completely cooked through. Turn after half the time.
Hot Mint and Pistachio Sauce 1. Peel and chop the pistachio nuts. Add to a small saucepan and roast for 2 minutes or until hot. Lower the heat and add the mint gel, letting it melt over low heat.
2. Add the peppers to taste. By stirring the peppers, they will cook more evenly.
Fact! Lamb that is grain fed has a less gamey flavor than the grass-fed lamb. So if you usually don't like lamb because it is gamey, try grain-fed lamb.

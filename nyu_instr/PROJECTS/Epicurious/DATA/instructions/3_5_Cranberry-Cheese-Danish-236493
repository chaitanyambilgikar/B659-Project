Preheat oven to 375°F. Line 12x18x1-inch baking sheet with parchment paper. Unroll both tubes of dough; arrange side by side in pan (some of dough may hang over 1 long edge). Press to seal all seams to form 1 large piece and cover pan bottom. Beat cream cheese, 1/2 cup sugar, 21/2 tablespoons cornstarch, and egg yolk in medium bowl to blend. Mix in cottage cheese. Mix cranberry sauce and remaining 1 tablespoon cornstarch in small bowl until cornstarch dissolves.
Spread cheese filling lengthwise over left half of dough, leaving 1-inch plain dough border on top, bottom, and left edges. Top cheese with cranberry filling. Using parchment as aid, fold plain dough over, enclosing filling; peel back paper. Seal dough edges. Cut several diagonal slits in top of dough. Beat egg white until frothy; brush over top. Bake until cooked through, about 35 minutes. Dust with more sugar and cool. Serve warm or at room temperature.

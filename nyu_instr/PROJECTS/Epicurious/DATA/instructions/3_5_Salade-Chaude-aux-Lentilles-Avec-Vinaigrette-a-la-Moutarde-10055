In a heavy saucepan combine lentils, water, onion, bacon, garlic, thyme, and parsley sprigs and simmer, covered, 20 minutes. Stir in carrots and simmer mixture, covered, until lentils are tender, about 10 minutes. Lentils may be made 2 days ahead and kept in cooking liquid, covered and chilled. Reheat lentils before proceeding with recipe.
Make vinaigrette: Transfer 2 tablespoons lentil-cooking liquid to a medium bowl and whisk in vinegar, mustard, and salt and pepper to taste. Add oil in a stream, whisking, and whisk dressing until emulsified.
Drain lentils well in a sieve and discard parsley sprigs and garlic. Toss lentils with chopped parsley and vinaigrette and season with salt and pepper.
Just before serving, arrange arugula decoratively around salad.

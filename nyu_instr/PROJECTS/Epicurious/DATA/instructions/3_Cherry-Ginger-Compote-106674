Combine all the ingredients in a microwavable 2-quart casserole. Cook, uncovered, at full power for 6 minutes. (I used a 650-700 watt carousel microwave.) Stir, making sure the sugar has dissolved, then return to the microwave. Cook 8 minutes more at full power. Cool, cover tightly and refrigerate for up to 1 week. Serve as a condiment.

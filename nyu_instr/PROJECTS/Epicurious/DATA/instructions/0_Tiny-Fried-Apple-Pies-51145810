1. Place filling ingredients in a large bowl and toss until well combined. Cut chilled dough into 2 equal pieces. Roll into equal rectangles about 1/4 inch thick. Onto one of the rectangles, place spoonfuls of filling (about 2 tablespoons each) in rows 1/2 inch apart. Place pies in the refrigerator and chill for 30 minutes.
2. To make the egg wash, whisk together egg and heavy cream. Using a pastry brush, carefully brush egg wash onto dough between the rows of filling. Gently lay the second dough rectangle over top and press around each mound of filling. Cut 3-by-1-inch rectangles with a pizza cutter and press the back of a fork along the edges to seal.
3. Preheat oil to 375°F. Carefully begin frying pies, a few at a time, for 7 to 8 minutes or until golden brown. Drain pies on paper towels and allow to cool.
4. Stir together the icing ingredients in a small bowl until smooth. Drizzle icing over pies and serve.

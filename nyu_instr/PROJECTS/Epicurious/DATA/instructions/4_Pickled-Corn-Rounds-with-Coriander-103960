Cook garlic, bell pepper, and onion in oil, covered, in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately low heat, stirring occasionally, until slightly softened but not browned, about 10 minutes. Reserve vegetables.
While vegetables are cooking, bring remaining ingredients except corn to a boil in a 4- to 6-quart nonreactive pot, stirring occasionally. Add corn and return to a boil, then simmer, uncovered, 5 minutes. Add reserved vegetables and bring to a simmer. Remove from heat and cool.
Transfer mixture to wide-mouthed glass jars and chill, covered, at least 2 hours and up to 2 weeks

Put graham crackers in a resealable plastic bag and with a rolling pin lightly crush until crumbs are coarse. In a bowl stir together crumbs and salt. Discard small tough muscle from side of each scallop and halve any large scallops. Pat scallops dry.
In a 4-quart heavy saucepan or heavy kettle heat 1 1/2 inches oil to 365°F. on a deep-fat thermometer. Working in batches of 6, dip scallops in egg to coat, letting excess drip off, and roll in crumb mixture. Fry scallops, stirring gently, 2 minutes, or until browned and cooked through. Transfer scallops as cooked with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain and season with salt and pepper.
Serve scallops on a platter with sauce.

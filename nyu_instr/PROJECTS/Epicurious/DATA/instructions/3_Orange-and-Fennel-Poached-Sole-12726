In a skillet boil the orange juice, the wine, and the vinegar with the shallots, the fennel seeds, and the zest, shaking the skillet, until most of the liquid is evaporated. Add the water, bring the mixture to a boil, and in it poach the sole, covered, at a bare simmer for 10 minutes. Transfer the sole with a slotted spatula to 2 plates and keep it warm, covered. Boil the poaching liquid until it is reduced to about 1/3 cup, remove the skillet from the heat, and swirl in the butter. Season the sauce with salt and pepper and pour it through a fine sieve over the sole.

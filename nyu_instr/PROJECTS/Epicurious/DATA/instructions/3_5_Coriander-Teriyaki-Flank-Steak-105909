Press coriander onto both sides of steak and put steak on a large plate. Stir together soy sauce, brown sugar, ginger, garlic, and oil and pour over steak, turning steak to coat. Marinate, turning occasionally, 10 minutes.
Preheat broiler.
Heat an oiled broiler pan about 3 inches from broiler until hot. Put steak on hot pan and broil 4 to 5 minutes per side for medium-rare. Transfer steak to a cutting board and let stand 5 minutes before slicing. Sprinkle with cilantro.

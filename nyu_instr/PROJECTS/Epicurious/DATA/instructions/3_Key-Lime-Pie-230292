Preheat oven to 325°F.
For crust: Mix graham cracker crumbs with sugar and butter. Spread evenly over bottom and sides of a nonstick 9" pie pan and bake 5 minutes. Remove from oven; let cool.
For filling: In a medium bowl, using a fork, beat milk, lime juice, and zest. Add 1 whole egg and 2 egg yolks (reserve whites) and beat well. Set aside. In a large mixing bowl, beat egg whites until foamy. After about 20 seconds, add cream of tartar. Fold whites into custard mixture and pour into partially baked crust. Bake 45 to 60 minutes or until set. Let cool. Serve with whipped cream. Garnish with lime slices, if desired.

For citrus coulis: Purée tangerines, tangerine juice, sugar, and 1 tablespoon lemon juice in a blender until smooth. Pour through a strainer set over a medium bowl. Add more lemon juice to taste, if desired. Chill to thicken slightly, about 1 hour or up to 1 day.
For soufflé: Preheat oven to 400°F. Butter soufflé dish; coat with 2 tablespoons sugar and set aside. Stir 2 tablespoons tangerine juice and cornstarch in a small bowl. Bring 1/2 cup tangerine juice, 3 tablespoons sugar, and zest to boil in a small saucepan, stirring until sugar dissolves. Add cornstarch mixture and whisk constantly until thickened, about 1 minute. Transfer to a large bowl; whisk in lemon juice and remaining 2 tablespoons tangerine juice. Let tangerine mixture cool.
Meanwhile, place egg whites with cream of tartar in another large bowl. Using an electric mixer with clean, dry beaters, beat on medium speed until soft peaks form. With machine running, gradually add remaining 1/2 cup sugar by tablespoonfuls, beating to blend between additions. Continue beating meringue over medium-high speed until firm, glossy peaks form.
Using an electric mixer, beat cooled tangerine mixture with egg yolks in another large bowl until light and pale yellow, about 3 minutes. Gently stir in 1/2 cup meringue, then carefully fold in remaining meringue. Transfer mixture to prepared soufflé dish. Smooth top, if desired.
Place soufflé in oven; reduce temperature to 375°F. Bake until set around edges but still slightly wobbly in center, about 40 minutes.
Dust with powdered sugar and serve immediately. Scoop onto plates and drizzle with citrus coulis, passing any remaining coulis alongside.

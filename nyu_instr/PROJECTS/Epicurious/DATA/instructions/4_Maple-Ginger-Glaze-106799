1. In a small, heavy saucepan, wilt the onion, ginger, and garlic in olive oil over low heat for about 5 to 7 minutes, stirring once or twice.
2. Add the remaining ingredients. Bring to a boil and cook for 3 to 5 minutes, stirring. Reduce heat to medium and simmer for 10 minutes to thicken sauce, stirring occasionally. Strain and finely mince the onion, ginger, and garlic; return to the sauce. Remove from heat and cool to room temperature. Refrigerate, covered, until needed.

Toss shrimp with garlic, 1 tablespoon oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.
Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a 12-inch heavy nonstick skillet over high heat until it shimmers, then sauté shrimp, stirring occasionally, until just cooked through, about 3 minutes. Meanwhile, toss together beans, celery, arugula, lemon juice, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a bowl.
Add shrimp with any juices and toss.

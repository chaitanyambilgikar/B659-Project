For Vanilla Caramel Sauce: Combine all ingredients in heavy large saucepan. Stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves and butter melts, about 3 minutes. Increase heat to medium-high. Boil sauce without stirring until thick enough to coat spoon or attach candy thermometer and boil until thermometer registers 224°F, about 7 minutes. Strain sauce into medium bowl. (Can be made 1 week ahead. Cool, cover, and chill. Rewarm before using.)
For Fudge Sauce: Bring cream and corn syrup to simmer in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat. Remove from heat. Add chocolate, espresso powder, and cinnamon. Whisk until chocolate melts and sauce is smooth. Cool.
For Crust and Filling: Preheat oven to 350°F. Finely grind first 4 ingredients in processor. Add warm butter. Using on/off turns, blend just until crumbs are evenly moist. Firmly press half of crust mixture (about 3 cups) over bottom of 10-inch springform pan; press remaining crumb mixture up sides of pan. Freeze crust 10 minutes. Bake crust until slightly golden, about 14 minutes. Cool crust completely.
Spread 1/3 of ice cream (about 1 2/3 cups) evenly over bottom of crust. Spread 1 cup fudge sauce over. Freeze 10 minutes. Spread 1/3 of ice cream, then 1 cup fudge sauce over. Freeze 10 minutes. Spread remaining ice cream over. Drizzle with remaining fudge sauce. Freeze torte until firm, about 2 hours. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and keep frozen.)
Let torte stand 10 minutes at room temperature. Cut around pan sides to loosen. Remove pan sides. Cut torte into wedges. Serve with warm vanilla caramel sauce.

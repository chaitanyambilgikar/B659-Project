Brown the chicken pieces in the butter, turning each piece to color evenly. When pieces are browned, add chopped garlic and continue cooking for a minute or two. Add salt and freshly ground pepper to taste and 1/2 cup white wine. Cook gently over a low flame until chicken is tender. Remove chicken to a hot platter and pour the pan juices over it. Garnish the sautéed chicken with finely chopped parsley.

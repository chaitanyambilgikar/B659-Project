Blend together garlic, tahini, lemon juice, salt, and 1/4 cup water in a blender until smooth.
Bring remaining 1/2 cup water to a simmer in a 12-inch skillet over moderately high heat.
Add spinach in handfuls, tossing with tongs, and cook until wilted, about 5 minutes.
Drain spinach in a large sieve set over a bowl, pressing to extract any excess liquid.

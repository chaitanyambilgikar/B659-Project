Combine sugar, 2 1/2 tbsp water, and corn syrup in a medium-sized saucepan. Simmer over low heat until sugar dissolves, about 5 minutes. Continue to cook until sugar is dark in color. Slowly add milk and butter and whip briskly with wire whisk until sauce is smooth. Keep warm. Preheat grill pan over medium heat. Grill pineapple 2 to 3 minutes on each side or until grill marks appear. Place 2 slices on each plate and drizzle with 2 tbsp caramel sauce. Garnish each plate with 1 tbsp macadamias.

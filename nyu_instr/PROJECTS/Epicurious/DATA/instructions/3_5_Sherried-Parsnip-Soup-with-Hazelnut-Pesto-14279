In a 4-quart heavy kettle cook parsnips, shallots, leeks, and celery with salt and pepper to taste in butter over moderately high heat, stirring, until vegetables are browned, about 10 minutes. Add 1/4 cup Sherry and coil until liquid is evaporated. Stir in water and simmer, covered, about 20 minutes, or until vegetables are very soft.
Purée mixture in batches in a blender (use caution when blending hot liquids), transferring to a large saucepan. Stir in remaining tablespoon Sherry, cream, and salt and pepper to taste and cook over moderately high heat, stirring occasionally, until heated through.
Serve soup topped with a dollop of hazelnut pesto and garnished with a few hazelnuts.

Cut zucchini lengthwise into 1/8-inch-thick slices with slicer and transfer to a colander set over a bowl. Sprinkle zucchini with salt and toss to coat. Let stand 5 minutes, then rinse under cold running water. Transfer zucchini to a clean kitchen towel and spread in 1 layer, then gently roll up towel to absorb excess water and let stand 5 minutes more.
Whisk together oil, zest, juice, mustard, anchovy paste, and pepper in a large bowl until combined.
Add zucchini, frisée, herbs, olives, and onion and toss to coat. Serve immediately.

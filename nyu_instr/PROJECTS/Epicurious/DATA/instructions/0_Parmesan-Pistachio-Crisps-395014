Preheat oven to 350°F with rack in middle.
Place silpat on a large baking sheet, or if not using a silpat or nonstick baking sheet, line a large baking sheet with parchment. Put rounded teaspoons of cheese 2 inches apart on baking sheets and spread each into a 1 1/2 inch circle.
Sprinkle each round lightly with chopped pistachios (about 1/8 teaspoon for each) and bake until just golden, 6 to 8 minutes.
Let crisps cool on sheet 1 minute then transfer to a rack to cool completely. Bake more crisps in same manner on cooled sheet, wiping nonstick or silpat in between batches (if using), or replacing parchment with each new batch.

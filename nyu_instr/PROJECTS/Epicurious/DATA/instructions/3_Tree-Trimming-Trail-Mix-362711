Heat oven to 400°F. Pop popcorn as directed on package; set aside. Combine honey, oil, bay leaves and salt in a small saucepan over low heat, stirring frequently until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Remove bay leaves. Toss warm popcorn with dried fruit and almonds in a bowl. Drizzle trail mix with honey glaze, toss again, and spread evenly on a baking sheet. Bake until golden, about 3 minutes. Turn off oven, remove sheet and toss trail mix with a spatula; spread evenly on sheet and return to oven for 2 minutes more.

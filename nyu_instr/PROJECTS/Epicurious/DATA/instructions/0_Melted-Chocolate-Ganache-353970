Place the butter and chocolate in the top of a double boiler or in a stainless-steel bowl placed over a saucepan one-quarter full of water. Over medium-high heat, stir the mixture frequently with a rubber spatula until the chocolate is almost melted. Remove from the bottom pan and stir until the chocolate has finished melting.
Cool for 15 minutes or more, until thickened, before using.

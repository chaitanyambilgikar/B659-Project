In a small heavy saucepan cook the corn in the butter over moderately high heat, stirring, for 1 minute, add the broth, and bring the liquid to a boil. Stir in the couscous, remove the pan from the heat, and let the mixture stand, covered, for 5 minutes. Stir in the chives and salt and pepper to taste.

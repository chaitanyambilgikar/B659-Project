Peel and grate coarse the sweet potato. In a food processor chop fine the grated sweet potato with the gingerroot, the lemon juice, the red pepper flakes, and the salt, add the egg and the flour, and blend the mixture well. In a large saucepan heat 1 1/2 inches of the oil over moderately high heat to 360°F. on a deep-fat thermometer, drop tablespoons of the sweet-potato mixture into the oil in batches, and fry the fritters, turning them, for 2 minutes, or until they are golden. Transfer the fritters to paper towels to drain.

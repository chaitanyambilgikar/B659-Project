Make pears: Using melon baller, remove core from bottom end of pears. Bring tequila and sugar to boil in heavy large saucepan, stirring until sugar dissolves. Add 7 pears. Reduce heat to medium-low. Cover; cook until tip of small knife pierces pears easily, turning occasionally, about 40 minutes. Transfer pears to large bowl. Repeat with remaining pears and poaching liquid. Return all pears to liquid; cool. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Cover; chill.)
Make sauce: Purée berries, jelly and liqueur in processor. Strain into medium bowl. Cover; chill until cold. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and keep chilled.) Spoon 2 tablespoons sauce onto each plate. Stand 1 pear in center of each.

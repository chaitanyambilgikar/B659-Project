Cut off root ends of leeks and trim tops so that leeks are 8 to 10 inches long. Discard tough outer leaves. Separate leaves and soak in a large dish filled with water, rubbing to remove any sand.
Fill a large bowl with ice and cold water.
Drain leeks and in a kettle of boiling salted water blanch in batches, stirring, 1 to 2 minutes, or until tender, transferring leeks as cooked with tongs to ice water. Drain cooled leeks on paper towels, arranging them in one layer and stacking more paper towels and leeks as needed. Leeks may be made 1 day ahead, rolled in damp paper towels, and chilled in a sealed plastic bag.
Preheat oven to 450°F. and lightly oil a shallow baking pan.
Separately wrap garlic and beets tightly in foil and on a baking sheet roast in middle of oven 30 minutes, or until garlic is tender. Transfer garlic to a plate and roast beets until tender, about 30 minutes more. Unwrap garlic and beets carefully and cool until they can be handled. Squeeze garlic out of peel into blender. Peel and cut beets in to 2-inch pieces, discarding stems. In blender blend garlic with beets, water, lemon juice, vinegar, and slat and pepper to taste until smooth. Sauce may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered. Reheat sauce over low heat and season with salt and pepper.
Season tops of pompano or sole fillets with salt and pepper and half of zest. Wrap about 5 leek strips completely around each fillet, overlapping them slightly and leaving ends of fillet exposed. Transfer fillets as wrapped to oiled pan and brush tops with oil. Roast fillets in middle of oven 8 minutes or until cooked through.
Serve fillets over sauce and garnish with remaining zest.

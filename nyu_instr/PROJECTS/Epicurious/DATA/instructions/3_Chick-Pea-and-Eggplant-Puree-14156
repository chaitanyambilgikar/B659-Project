Cut eggplant into 3/4-inch-thick slices and sprinkle both sides with salt. Arrange eggplant in a large colander set over a bowl and let stand 30 minutes to drain.
Preheat broiler.
Rinse eggplant slices and pat dry with paper towels. Broil eggplant on a rack of a broiler pan about 4 inches from heat until deep golden, about 6 minutes on each side. When eggplant is cool enough to handle, peel off skins, scraping all flesh from skins and discarding them.
In a food processor pulse eggplant with remaining ingredients until just puréed and season with salt and pepper. Purée may be made 3 days ahead and chilled, covered.

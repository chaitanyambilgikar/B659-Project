Make crust: Preheat oven to 350°F.
Stir together gingersnap crumbs and butter in a bowl until crumbs are evenly moistened, then press onto bottom of buttered springform pan. Bake in middle of oven until edge is golden brown, about 8 minutes (watch carefully toward end of baking; crust burns easily). Cool in pan on a rack.
Make filling: Sprinkle gelatin over bourbon in a small bowl and let soften.
Beat together yolks and brown sugar with an electric mixer at high speed until thick and pale, 3 to 5 minutes. Reduce speed to moderate and mix in pumpkin, spices, and salt.
Transfer pumpkin mixture to a 4-quart heavy saucepan and cook over moderate heat, stirring constantly, until it registers160°F on a candy or instant-read thermometer, about 6 minutes. Remove pan from heat and immediately add gelatin mixture, stirring until dissolved. Transfer to a large metal bowl set in a larger bowl of ice and cold water and cool, stirring occasionally, until the consistency of raw egg whites, about 15 minutes.
Beat egg whites with cleaned beaters at high speed until frothy, then gradually add granulated sugar, beating until whites hold stiff, glossy peaks. Fold into pumpkin mixture gently but thoroughly.
Beat cream in another bowl with cleaned beaters until it just holds stiff peaks, then fold into pumpkin mixture gently but thoroughly. Pour filling into springform pan, smoothing top, and chill, uncovered, 1 hour. Cover and chill until set, at least 3 hours.
Before serving, run a thin knife around edge of pan and remove side.

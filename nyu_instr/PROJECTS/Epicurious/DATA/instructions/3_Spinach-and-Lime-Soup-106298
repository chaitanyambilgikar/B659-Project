Preheat oven to 450°F. Toss tortilla strips and vegetable oil in large bowl to coat. Transfer strips to baking sheet. Bake until crisp, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes.
Bring chicken broth, cumin, and cayenne pepper to simmer in heavy large saucepan over medium heat. Add fresh spinach and cook until spinach is wilted but still bright green, about 4 minutes. Add cilantro and 3 tablespoons lime juice. Season soup to taste with salt and pepper, adding more lime juice if desired. Ladle soup into bowls, top with tortilla strips and serve.

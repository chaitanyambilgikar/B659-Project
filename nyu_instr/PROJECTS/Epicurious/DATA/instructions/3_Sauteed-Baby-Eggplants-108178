Peel a 1-inch-wide strip of skin lengthwise from each eggplant half opposite cut side. Sprinkle eggplants with salt on both sides and let drain on a rack set over a shallow baking pan 20 minutes. Rinse eggplants well, then firmly squeeze out moisture and pat dry with paper towels.
Stir together soy sauce and mirin in a small bowl.
Heat oil in a 12-inch heavy nonstick skillet over moderate heat until hot but not smoking, then fry eggplants, peeled sides down, until undersides are browned, 5 to 6 minutes.
Turn over and brush with soy mixture. Fry eggplants until tender, 4 to 6 minutes more, then add remaining soy mixture to skillet and cook, turning eggplants once or twice, until liquid is absorbed, about 2 minutes.

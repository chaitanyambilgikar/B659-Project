Place 3/4 cup water, 2 eggs, vanilla extract and 1/4 teaspoon salt in blender. Add flour and blend thoroughly until smooth. Let batter stand 1 hour.
Place hoop cheese in processor. If using cottage cheese, place in center of kitchen towel and squeeze to remove excess moisture until cheese is very dry and measures 1 1/2 cups packed; transfer to processor. Add 1 egg, 1/4 cup sugar, 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/8 teaspoon salt. Using on/off turns, blend until mixture is almost smooth. Transfer filling to bowl. Cover and refrigerate.
Heat heavy small skillet with 6-inch-diameter bottom over medium-high heat. Brush lightly with some melted butter. Pour 2 1/2 tablespoons batter into skillet, tilting to spread evenly. Cook until crepe is lightly browned on bottom, about 30 seconds. Turn crepe out onto paper towel and cover with another paper towel. Repeat with remaining batter, brushing skillet with more melted butter as needed.
Place 1 crepe on work surface. Place 3 tablespoons filling just below center of cooked side of crepe. Fold bottom over filling, then fold sides in; roll to enclose filling. Transfer to foil-lined plate. Repeat with remaining filling and 7 more crepes (reserve remaining crepes for another use).
Heat 2 tablespoons oil and any re-maining melted butter in heavy large skillet over medium-low heat until hot. Place blintzes, seam side down, in skillet. Cook until bottoms are brown and crisp, shaking pan occasionally, about 6 minutes. Turn blintzes over; cook until bottoms are brown and crisp, about 5 minutes. Transfer 2 blintzes to each of 4 plates. Top with Caramelized Apples and serve.

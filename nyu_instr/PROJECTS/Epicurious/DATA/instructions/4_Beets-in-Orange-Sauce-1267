Preheat oven to 400°F. Wrap 2 beets together in foil. Repeat with remaining beets. Place on baking sheet. Bake until tender, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Cool. Peel beets. Cut each into 8 wedges.
Combine beets and remaining ingredients in medium nonaluminum saucepan. Simmer over medium heat until sauce is syrupy, stirring often, about 8 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
(Can be made 1 day ahead. Chill. Rewarm over low heat, stirring often.) Serve hot.

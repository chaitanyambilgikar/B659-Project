Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Place eggplant rounds and peppers on rimmed baking sheet; brush with olive oil, then sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place vegetables on grill and cook until tender and golden, about 4 minutes per side.
Arrange vegetables on platter. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons (or more) Roasted-Garlic Oil; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Serve vegetables warm or at room temperature.

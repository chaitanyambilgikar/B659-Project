Preheat oven to 375°F with rack in middle. Generously butter muffin cups and dust with flour, knocking out excess.
Whisk together 1 1/2 cups flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
Beat butter with 2/3 cup granulated sugar using an electric mixer at medium speed until light and fluffy. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in zest.
Add flour mixture in 2 batches alternately with wine, beginning and ending with flour and mixing until just incorporated.
Toss grapes with remaining tablespoon flour, then fold into batter.
Divide batter among muffin cups. Sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoons granulated sugar. Bake until golden and springy to the touch, 18 to 20 minutes. Cool in pan 5 minutes, then loosen with a knife and remove. Cool to warm, 5 to 10 minutes more.

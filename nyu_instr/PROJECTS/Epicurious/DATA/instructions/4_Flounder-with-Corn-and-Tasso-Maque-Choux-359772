Line pie dish with large sheet of foil, leaving long overhang on 1 side. Separate rings of 1 shallot slice; scatter over foil. Top with 1 tablespoon butter, sliced garlic clove, 2 lime slices, and 1 orange slice. Sprinkle 1 fillet on both sides with salt and cayenne. Arrange fillet, skin side down, atop seasonings in dish. Top fillet with 2 thyme sprigs. Spoon 2 tablespoons beer and 1 tablespoon wine around fillet. Fold long foil overhang over fillet to opposite edge of foil, pressing foil onto fillet. Fold foil edge over to seal on 3 sides, then fold again to double seal. Transfer packet to baking sheet. Repeat with remaining seasonings and fillets.

1. In a heavy skillet, cook the bacon until crisp. Transfer it to a paper towel-lined plate.
2. Remove all but 1 tablespoon of the fat and return the pan to high heat.
3. Add the potatoes, white scallions (if using), garlic, salt, pepper, and 1/4 cup water. Bring to a boil.
4. Cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until the potatoes are just tender, 8 to 10 minutes.
5. Add the bacon, broken into pieces. Cook, stirring occasionally, for about 10 minutes more.
6. Remove from heat, garnish with the green scallions (if using), and serve.

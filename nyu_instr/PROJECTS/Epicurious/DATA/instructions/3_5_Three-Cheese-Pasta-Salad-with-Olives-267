Cook pasta in pot of boiling water until tender but still firm to bite. Drain. Rinse with cold water and drain well.
Mix pasta, olives, bell pepper, all cheeses and basil in large bowl to combine. Pour vinegar into small bowl. Gradually whisk in oil. Add sugar; season dressing to taste with salt and pepper. Toss salad with enough dressing to coat. Cover and refrigerate until well chilled, about 2 hours. (Can be prepared 8 hours ahead; keep refrigerated.)

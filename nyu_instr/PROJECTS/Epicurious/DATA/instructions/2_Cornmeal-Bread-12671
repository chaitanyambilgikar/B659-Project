Lightly grease 2 loaf pans, 5 1/2 by 3 by 2 1/2 inches.
In a bowl stir together warm water, yeast, and sugar and let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. In a small bowl stir together flour, cornmeal, and salt and gradually stir into yeast mixture, stirring until a soft dough is formed. On a lightly floured work surface with floured hands knead dough 5 minutes, or until smooth and elastic, and shape into a ball. Let dough rest, covered, 10 minutes.
Form dough into 2 ovals. Transfer dough to loaf pans and let rise, covered loosely with plastic wrap, in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 400°F.
Bake loaves in middle of oven 20 minutes, or until tops are golden and bread pulls away slightly from sides of pans. Cool loaves in pans on a rack. (Bread may be made 1 day ahead and kept wrapped in plastic wrap at room temperature.)

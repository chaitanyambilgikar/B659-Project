Pour 1 1/4 cups of champagne into an ice tray and freeze into cubes. Pour crème de cassis into a metal bowl and freeze it until it is very thick. (The crème de cassis will not freeze solid.) The liquids may be prepared up to this point 8 hours in advance.
In a blender, blend frozen champagne and 1 cup cracked ice with the cr(me de cassis, scraping down the sides occasionally, and the remaining champagne until the mixture is smooth but still frozen. Divide mixture between 2 stemmed glasses.

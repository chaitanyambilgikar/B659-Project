Preheat oven to 375°F. Place onion and garlic in small baking dish. Drizzle with oil. Bake until soft, stirring occasionally, about 50 minutes. Cool.
Meanwhile, char peppers over gas flame or under broiler until blackened on all sides. Cool 10 minutes. Peel and seed peppers; pat dry. Place all ingredients except chives in processor. Puree until almost smooth. Transfer to bowl. Stir in chives. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.)

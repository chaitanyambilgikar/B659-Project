Use kitchen shears to cut the links into 1 1/2-inch pieces. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat and brown the sausage pieces on all sides, about 5 minutes. Add the Sherry and cook over medium heat for 3 minutes.
Serve sprinkled with parsley. If the sausage pieces are to be served as a tapas, spear them with toothpicks.

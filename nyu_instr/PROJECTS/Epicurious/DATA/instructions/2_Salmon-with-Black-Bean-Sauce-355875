1. Preheat the oven to 400°F. Lightly grease a shallow roasting pan. Combine 1/2 cup boiling water and the chopped beans in a small bowl; set aside for 10 minutes, then drain.
2. Meanwhile, arrange the salmon in the roasting pan, skinned side down. Drizzle 2 tablespoons of the oil over the salmon and bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until cooked to your desired doneness.
3. Meanwhile, heat 2 teaspoons oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the soaked and drained black beans, the ginger, and garlic; cook for 1 minute. Whisk together the broth, 1/3 cup water, the wine, cornstarch, and sugar in a bowl and add to the black bean mixture. Bring the sauce to a boil, stirring constantly, and simmer for 2 minutes. Serve each portion of salmon topped with some of the sauce and sprinkled with some of the scallions.

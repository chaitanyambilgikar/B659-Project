Combine first 4 ingredients in saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to boil; add kumquats. Simmer until kumquats are tender and liquid is syrupy, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in Grand Marnier. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be made 1 week ahead. Cool, cover, and chill. Rewarm over low heat before continuing.) Strain glaze into small bowl. Discard cinnamon and bay leaf; reserve candied kumquats and glaze separately.
Divide arugula among plates. Top each with 5 duck slices; brush with glaze. Place 1 kumquat quarter on each duck slice.

Preheat the oven to 450°F. Wash lemon and ginger well, dry, and cut into slices.
Remove the giblet pack and neck from the chicken. Rinse the chicken and pat dry with paper towels. Flip the wings back and tuck under the body.
Season the inside cavity with salt and pepper. Fill the cavity with the lemon, ginger, and garlic. Fold the skin over to close the opening, and then tie the legs together with a piece of kitchen twine. Put the chicken into a shallow baking dish. Coat the skin all over with olive oil, then season with salt and pepper.
Roast for 15 minutes and then lower the oven temperature to 375°F. Roast for an additional 60-65 minutes, until the juices run clear. Try not to open the oven door too much while the chicken is cooking, particularly during the first 15 minutes. Let the chicken rest for 10 minutes before you carve it. Strain the pan juices, remove the fat, and serve with the chicken.

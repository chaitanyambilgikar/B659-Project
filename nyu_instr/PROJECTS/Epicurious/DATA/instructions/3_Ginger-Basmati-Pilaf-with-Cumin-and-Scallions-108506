Wash rice in several changes of cold water in a bowl until water is clear, then drain well in a sieve.
Cook white and pale green scallions and ginger in oil in a 2-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat, stirring, until scallions are softened, about 3 minutes. Add rice and cumin seeds and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in water and salt and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and cook, covered, until rice is tender and water is absorbed, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from heat and add scallion greens (do not stir), then let stand, covered, 5 minutes. Fluff rice with a fork, stirring in scallion greens.

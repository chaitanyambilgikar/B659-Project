Preheat oven to 325°F.
Cook shallot in butter in a large heavy skillet over moderately low heat, stirring, until butter is melted and shallot is slightly softened, about 5 minutes.
Combine bread crumbs, herbs, salt, and pepper in a large bowl and stir in butter mixture. Drizzle with Cognac, tossing to combine, and gently stir in broth. (Use 1 1/2 cups broth if you like a moist stuffing, 1 cup if you prefer it drier.)
Transfer stuffing to a buttered 3-quart shallow baking dish. Cover with foil and bake in middle of oven 30 minutes, then uncover and bake until top is crisp and stuffing is heated through, about 30 minutes more.

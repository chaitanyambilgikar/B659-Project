Assemble brownies: Using 2 3/4-inch round cookie cutter, cut each brownie into circle.
Place frosting in small bowl and tint orange (see Decorating Tips). Using small offset spatula or knife, spread frosting in thin even layer on top of each brownie.
Decorate brownie pops: Sprinkle each brownie with orange sprinkles.
To create eyes, arrange 2 candy corn near top of 1 brownie and press gently to secure. To make nose, arrange 1 candy corn in between eyes and perpendicular to brownie. To create smile, arrange sugar candy bats in smile shape below nose and press into place. To make stem, push green apple licorice into top of brownie. To create leaves, arrange 2 mini green gummy candies alongside stem, gently pressing into frosting to secure. Decorate remaining brownies in same manner.
Insert candy or craft stick into one side of each brownie.

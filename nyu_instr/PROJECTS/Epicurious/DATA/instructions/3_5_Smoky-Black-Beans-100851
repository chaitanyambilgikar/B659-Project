Mince onion. If using dried chipotle, in a bowl soak in boiling-hot water to cover 5 minutes and drain. Wearing protective gloves, mince soaked or canned chipotle. In a colander rinse black beans well and drain.
In a 2- to 3-quart heavy saucepan cook onion in oil over moderately low heat, stirring, until softened. Add chipotle and cook, stirring, 2 minutes. Add beans, 1 cup water, and orange juice and simmer, mashing mixture 3 or 4 times with a potato masher, until slightly thickened, about 15 minutes. Season beans with salt.

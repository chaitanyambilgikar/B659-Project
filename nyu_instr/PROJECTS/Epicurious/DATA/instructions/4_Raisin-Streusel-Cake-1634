For Streusel: Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350°F. Coat 9x9-inch pan with 2-inch-high sides generously with margarine. Mix 1/4 cup margarine, sugar and spices in medium bowl. Gradually add matzo meal and mix until crumbly. Spread half of streusel on baking sheet and bake until golden and crisp, about 10 minutes. Cool and break into bits.
For Cake: Combine first 4 ingredients in small bowl. Using electric mixer, beat egg whites in large bowl until soft peaks form. Gradually add 1 cup sugar and beat until stiff but not dry.
Using same beaters, beat egg yolks and remaining 1/3 cup sugar in another bowl until mixture is thick and slowly dissolving ribbon forms when beaters are lifted. At low speed, beat in nondairy creamer, then margarine, lemon peel and lemon juice. Add dry ingredients and stir until well blended. Fold in egg whites in 2 additions.
Pour half of batter into prepared pan. Sprinkle baked streusel over. Sprinkle with half of raisins. Spread remaining cake batter over. Sprinkle with unbaked streusel and remaining raisins. Bake until tester inserted into center of cake comes out dry, about 40 minutes. Cool cake in pan on rack. Cover with foil and let stand 1 hour to soften topping. (Can be prepared 2 days ahead. Keep covered and store at room temperature.) Cut into squares and serve.

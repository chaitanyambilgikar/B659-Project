Toast the bread slices on a rack in a preheated 350°F. oven until they are golden, sprinkle one side of each toast with the Parmesan, and broil the toast under a heated broiler about 4 inches from the heat for 1 minute, or until the cheese is bubbly.
In a skillet heat the butter over moderately low heat until the foam subsides and in it cook the shallots, stirring, until they are softened. Remove the skillet from the heat, whisk in the sour cream, the Worcestershire sauce, the Tabasco, and salt and pepper to taste, and keep the sauce warm, covered.
Broil the steak on the rack of a broiler pan, brushed with the oil, under the preheated broiler about 8 inches from the heat, turning it once, for 7 minutes on each side, or until it is medium-rare, transfer it to a carving board, and let it stand for 1 minute. Slice the steak, reserving any juices, and divide it between the toasts, arranging it in overlapping slices. Nap the steak with the reserved juices and serve it with the sauce.

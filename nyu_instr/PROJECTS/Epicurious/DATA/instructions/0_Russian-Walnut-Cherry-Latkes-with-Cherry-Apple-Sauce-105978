Melt 1 tablespoon butter with 1 tablespoon oil in heavy large nonstick skillet over medium heat until hot but not smoking. Working in batches, drop batter by heaping tablespoonfuls into skillet and spread to 2 1/2-inch rounds. Cook until bottoms are golden, about 1 1/2 minutes per side. Using slotted spatula, transfer latkes to plates. Add more butter and oil as necessary and allow to get hot before adding more batter. Serve immediately with Cherry-Apple Sauce .

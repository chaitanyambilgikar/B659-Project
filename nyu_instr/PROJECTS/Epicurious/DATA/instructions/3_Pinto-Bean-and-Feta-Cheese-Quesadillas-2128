Combine first 6 ingredients in processor. Using on/off turns, process until very chunky puree forms. Transfer to bowl. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.)
Place 1 tortilla on work surface. Spread with 1/4 of bean mixture. Top with 2 tablespoons cheese, then another tortilla. Heat heavy medium skillet over medium heat. Brush with oil. Add quesadilla; cook until beans are heated and tortillas are brown, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer to warm plate and cover to keep warm. Repeat with remaining tortillas, bean mixture and cheese. Cut each quesadilla into 8 wedges and serve.

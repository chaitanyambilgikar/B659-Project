Mix butter, chopped parsley, garlic and grated lemon peel in small bowl to blend. Season lemon-garlic butter to taste with salt and pepper. Spread evenly over 1 side of each bread slice. Reassemble bread slices; wrap in foil. Place on baking sheet. (Can be made 8 hours ahead; chill.)
Preheat oven to 300°F. Bake bread until heated through, about 20 minutes; serve bread warm.

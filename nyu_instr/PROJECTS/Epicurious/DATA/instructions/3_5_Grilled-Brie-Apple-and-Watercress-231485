Spread 1 side of each baguette slice with butter. Turn over 4 slices and divide cheese and apple among them. Season apple with salt and pepper and top with remaining 4 baguette slices, buttered sides up.
Heat a dry 12-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat until hot, then cook sandwiches, pressing occasionally and turning over once, until bread is golden brown and cheese is melted, about 5 minutes total. Tuck watercress into sandwiches.

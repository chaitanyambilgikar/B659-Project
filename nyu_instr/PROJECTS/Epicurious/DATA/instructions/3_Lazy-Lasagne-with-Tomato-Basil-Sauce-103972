Preheat oven to 400°F.
Cook garlic in butter in a large heavy saucepan over moderate heat, stirring, 1 minute. Add tomatoes with purée and half of basil and simmer sauce over moderate heat, uncovered, stirring, 20 minutes. Stir in orange juice and salt and pepper to taste.
While sauce is cooking, stir together ricotta, parmesan, remaining basil, oregano, and salt and pepper to taste. Separate won ton skins and add to a saucepan of salted boiling water, then immediately transfer with a slotted spoon to a shallow dish filled with cold water.
Spread 1/2 cup tomato sauce evenly in bottom of a buttered 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass baking dish. Arrange 4 won ton skins, drained briefly on a kitchen towel, in 1 layer on top of sauce. Divide half of ricotta mixture evenly among squares in pan and top with 4 more squares, drained briefly. Spoon remaining ricotta mixture evenly on top of squares in pan and top with remaining 4 squares, drained.
Spoon several tablespoons sauce over each stack and bake, uncovered, in middle of oven until bubbling and heated through, about 10 minutes.

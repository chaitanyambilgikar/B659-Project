Cook chorizo, onion, garlic, bell pepper, pepper flakes, cumin, and salt in oil in a 3-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat, stirring, until vegetables are softened, about 10 minutes. Add broth (2 1/2 cups for smaller cans of beans or 3 cups for larger) and beans and simmer, partially covered, 15 minutes. Lightly mash beans with a potato masher to slightly thicken.

Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally.
Meanwhile, heat oil in heavy large deep skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion; sauté until slightly softened, about 4 minutes. Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper; add to skillet with rosemary and sauté until chicken is almost cooked through, about 4 minutes. Add endive; toss until slightly wilted and chicken is cooked through, about 1 minute.
Drain pasta, reserving 3/4 cup pasta cooking liquid. Return pasta to pot. Add chicken mixture, blue cheese, and enough pasta cooking liquid to moisten; toss to blend. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to large bowl; sprinkle with nuts, if desired.

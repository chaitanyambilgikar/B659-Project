Melt 1 tablespoon butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms and sauté until tender, about 8 minutes. Add chicken stock. Boil until mixture is reduced to 1 1/4 cups, about 12 minutes. Stir in whipping cream, parsley and mustard. Season sauce with salt and pepper.
Meanwhile, sprinkle veal chops with salt and pepper. Melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter in another heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add veal and cook to desired doneness, about 4 minutes per side for medium-rare.
Spoon Whipped Parsnips onto 4 plates. Place veal chops atop parsnips. Spoon sauce around parsnips and serve.

1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Cut the squash in half lengthwise and scoop out the seeds. Brush both halves with the butter and sprinkle with the brown sugar. Place them, cut sides down, on a baking sheet and roast until fork-tender, about 1 hour.
2. Meanwhile, in a skillet, combine the broth, syrup, cider, soy sauce, lemon juice, and garlic. Boil for 5 minutes, then whisk in the cornstarch and cook, whisking constantly, until the glaze thickens, about 1 to 2 minutes more. Set aside.
3. Slice the tofu into 1/2-inch-thick slabs. Then use a knife or a cookie cutter to create cubes or playful shapes. Heat the oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the tofu and sear until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes a side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.
4. Scoop the squash strands out and into bowls. Top with the tofu, drizzle on the glaze, and serve.

Heat in a pan 2 tablespoons butter and oil. Add the scallion, garlic and onion. Cook slowly for two minutes, then add cut-up oysters and clams. Pour on the cream and season with the salt and cayenne pepper. Bring very lightly to a boil, then add bit by bit the remaining butter and the chopped parsley. Simmer for a few minutes and serve.

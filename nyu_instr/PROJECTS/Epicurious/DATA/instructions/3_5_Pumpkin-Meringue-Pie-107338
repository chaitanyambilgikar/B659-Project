For crust: Combine flour, butter, sugar, and salt in bowl of electric mixer. Place bowl in freezer 15 minutes. Using electric mixer fitted with paddle attachment, beat mixture on low speed until pea-size clumps form. Drizzle 1/3 cup ice water over mixture and beat just until dough comes together. Gather dough into ball. Flatten into disk. Wrap dough in plastic and refrigerate at least 8 hours and up to 1 day. Let dough soften slightly at room temperature before using.
Roll out dough on lightly floured surface to 13-inch round. Transfer dough to 9-inch-diameter glass pie dish. Trim overhang to 1 inch. Fold in overhang, forming double-thick sides. Crimp dough edge decoratively. Refrigerate crust 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 425°F. Line crust with foil. Fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake until sides are set, about 20 minutes. Remove foil and weights. Bake until golden brown, placing aluminum foil collar around edge of crust if browning too quickly, about 15 minutes. Cool completely. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and let stand at room temperature.)
For filling: Preheat oven to 325°F. Whisk pumpkin, cream, maple sugar, cinnamon, ginger, and salt in large bowl to blend. Whisk in eggs. Pour mixture into crust. Place aluminum foil collar around edge of crust. Bake until filling is set and knife inserted into center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool to room temperature.
For meringue: Preheat broiler. Whisk egg whites and sugar in large metal bowl until combined. Place bowl over saucepan of simmering water and continue whisking until mixture is just warm, about 5 minutes. Remove bowl from over water. Using electric mixer, beat egg-white mixture on medium-high speed until stiff and glossy, about 5 minutes. Spread meringue atop pie, mounding in center. Place pie in broiler and broil until meringue is brown, about 1 minute. Cool to room temperature. (Can be made 8 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.)

Position rack in center of oven. Place baking sheet on rack. Preheat oven to 400°F. for 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, puree garbanzo beans, 2 ounces cheese, garlic, 1 tablespoon olive oil and cumin in processor until smooth. Season with cayenne pepper and salt and pepper to taste. Transfer puree to small bowl. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in heavy medium skillet over medium heat. Add lamb and sauté until cooked through and brown, breaking up with fork, about 5 minutes. Drain all fat from skillet. Season lamb with allspice, oregano and salt and pepper.
Brush bottom side of 1 pita round with olive oil. Place on work surface, oil side down. Blend 1/4 cup bean puree with 1/4 (about 1/2 cup scant) of lamb mixture. Spread on pita. Sprinkle 1 ounce (about 1/4 cup) cheese over. Sprinkle 1/4 of chopped red pepper over. Repeat with remaining pita rounds. Using spatula, transfer pizzas to hot baking sheet.
Bake until cheese melts and crust is crispy, about 12 minutes. Sprinkle each pizza with 1 1/2 tablespoons mint.

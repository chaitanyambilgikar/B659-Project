In a small saucepan bring broth and water to a simmer and keep at a bare simmer.
In a heavy saucepan melt butter over moderately high heat and stir in rice and fennel seeds, stirring until coated with butter. Add vermouth and cook, stirring, until absorbed. Continue cooking and adding broth, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly and letting each portion be absorbed before adding next. (After last broth addition rice should be al dente and creamy.)
Remove pan from heat and stir in Boursin, chives, and salt and pepper to taste.

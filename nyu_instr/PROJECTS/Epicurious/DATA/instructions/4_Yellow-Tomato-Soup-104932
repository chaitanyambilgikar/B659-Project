Sauté onion and bacon in heavy large pot over medium heat until onion is tender and beginning to brown, about 15 minutes. Add tomatoes and garlic and simmer until tomatoes are tender and juicy, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes. Add Sherry and wine; simmer 5 minutes. Add stock and simmer until mixture is reduced to 6 1/2 cups, about 15 minutes. Stir in chipotle chilies and oregano. Working in batches, puree soup in blender. Return to pot. Add cream and stir until heated through. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve.
*Chipotle chilies canned in a spicy tomato sauce, sometimes called adobo, are available at Latin American markets, specialty foods stores and some supermarkets.

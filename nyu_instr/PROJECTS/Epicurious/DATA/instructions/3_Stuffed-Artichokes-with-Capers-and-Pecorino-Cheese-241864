Preheat oven to 400°F. Heat 3 tablespoons oil in medium skillet over medium heat. Add onion; sauté until soft, about 6 minutes. Add next 3 ingredients; stir 2 minutes. Transfer to bowl; cool. Stir in breadcrumbs, 1/4 cup cheese, and capers. Season stuffing with salt and pepper.
Spoon 2 scant tablespoons bread stuffing into center of each prepared artichoke. Starting with bottom leaves of artichokes, gently pull each leaf outward from center and spoon in 1/2 to 1 teaspoon stuffing. Arrange artichokes in 13x9x2- inch glass baking dish. Drizzle with remaining 2 tablespoons oil; sprinkle with 1/4 cup cheese. Pour wine and broth into dish. Cover tightly with foil; bake until artichokes are tender when base is pierced with small sharp knife, about 1 hour. Spoon some cooking liquid over artichokes to moisten and serve.

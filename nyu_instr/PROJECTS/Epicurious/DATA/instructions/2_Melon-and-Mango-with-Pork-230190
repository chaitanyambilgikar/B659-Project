Mix marinade ingredients in a bowl; add pork and toss. Cover and refrigerate 30 minutes or longer (marinate overnight for sharper flavor). In a medium bowl, toss melon and mango strips with lemon juice; set aside. Heat oil in a nonstick cooking pan over high heat. Add pork and stir-fry until no pink remains, about 2 minutes. Add the fruit and stir-fry 1 minute. Stir in green onions, reduce heat and cook until all ingredients are heated through (about 1 minute). Season with salt and pepper. Garnish with orange twists and serve over rice.

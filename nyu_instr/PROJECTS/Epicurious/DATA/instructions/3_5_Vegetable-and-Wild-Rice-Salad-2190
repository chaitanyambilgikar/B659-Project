Bring broth to boil in heavy medium saucepan. Stir in rice. Reduce heat, cover and simmer until rice is tender, about 1 hour.
Meanwhile, cook broccoli, asparagus, green beans and carrots in large pot of rapidly boiling water until crisp-tender, about 6 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold water. Drain well.
Transfer rice to serving dish. Arrange vegetables atop rice. Sprinkle with tomato and cheese. Combine olive oil and vinegar in small bowl; whisk to blend. Drizzle over salad. Season with salt and pepper. Toss thoroughly and serve.

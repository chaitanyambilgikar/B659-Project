Preheat oven to 350°F. Cut two 1/2-inch-thick rounds horizontally from center of bread (reserve remaining bread for another use). Brush bread rounds on both sides lightly with oil; place on baking sheet. Bake until beginning to crisp, about 15 minutes. Cool 5 minutes. Top each bread round with half of cheeses, oregano, and crushed red pepper. Sprinkle each with half of tomatoes and olives. Bake bread rounds until cheeses melt and bottoms are crisp, about 15 minutes. Cut into wedges.

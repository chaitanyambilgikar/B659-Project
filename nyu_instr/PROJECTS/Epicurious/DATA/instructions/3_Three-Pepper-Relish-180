Preheat broiler. Holding bell pepper at stem, cut bell pepper into 3 flat pieces. Discard stem end, core and seeds. Repeat with remaining peppers. Place pieces skin side up on broiler proof pan. Broil bell peppers until skin is charred and blackened, about 8 minutes. Transfer bell peppers to plastic bag. Twist bag to seal and let stand until peppers are cool.(Can be made 1 day ahead; chill.)
Peel peppers and cut into strips. Combine with remaining ingredients in small bowl. Let stand 2 hours at room temperature. Serve.

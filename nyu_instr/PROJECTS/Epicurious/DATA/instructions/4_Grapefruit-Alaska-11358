Preheat oven to 425°F.
Halve grapefruits crosswise and with a grapefruit knife cut out sections from between membranes. Transfer sections and any juices to a large bowl and stir in 2 tablespoons sugar. Gently peel away and discard inner membranes from grapefruit halves, leaving rinds intact, to form 4 hollow, dry cups. Divide grapefruit mixture among cups.
In a bowl with an electric mixer beat egg whites on low speed until frothy. Increase speed to medium and beat until whites just hold soft peaks. Gradually beat in remaining 4 tablespoons sugar and beat on high speed until meringue is stiff and glossy.
Put 1 scoop ice cream in each cup and top with meringue, spreading evenly to seal edges. Put cups on a baking sheet and bake in middle of oven 8 to 10 minutes, or until meringue is golden. Serve immediately.

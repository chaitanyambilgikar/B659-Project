Place shiitakes in large bowl. Pour enough hot water over to cover. Let stand 30 minutes. Drain well. Cut off stems and discard. Thinly slice caps. Set aside.
Melt butter in heavy large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add onion, button mushroom stems and garlic; sauté until onion is golden, about 10 minutes. Add brandy; stir until almost all liquid evaporates, about 1 minute. Add flour; stir 2 minutes. Gradually stir in broth; add nutmeg. Cover; simmer until soup is slightly thickened, about 25 minutes.
Add shiitakes and sliced button mushroom caps to soup and simmer just until button mushroom caps are slightly wilted, about 5 minutes. Add cream and simmer until heated through, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Bring to simmer before serving.)

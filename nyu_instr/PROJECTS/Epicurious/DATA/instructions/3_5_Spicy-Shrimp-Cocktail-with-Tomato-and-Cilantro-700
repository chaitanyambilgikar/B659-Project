Combine tomato juice, clam juice, vinegar, cilantro sprigs, chilies and Worcestershire sauce in medium saucepan. Boil until sauce is slightly thickened and reduced to 1 2/3 cups, about 30 minutes. Strain into medium bowl.
Heat oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add shrimp and sauté until just cooked through, about 4 minutes. Cool.
Add shrimp, tomato, green onions, chopped cilantro, lime juice and sugar to sauce. Season with salt and pepper. Chill until cold, at least 3 hours. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and keep chilled.) Garnish with lime wedges.

Peel and sliver 4-5 cloves garlic. Make incisions in the leg with a very sharp pointed knife (such as small French paring knife). Force the slivers into the incisions and rub the roast well with pepper and a touch of rosemary or tarragon. Place on a rack and roast.
Serve with white beans, blended with the pan juices, and a bit of peeled, seeded and finely chopped fresh tomato. Drink a Chinon or a Bourgeuil.
Variations Provençal I: Cut 4-6 cloves garlic into slivers. Make fairly deep incisions in the leg and alternate garlic and anchovy fillets in the incisions (you will not need to add much salt to this anchovied leg). Roast. Serve with a ratatouille and drink a Châtauneuf-du-Pape.
Provençal II: Make incisions in the leg and stuff with garlic, pistachio nuts, and anchovies, pushing them deep into the incisions. Rub the leg with a touch of thyme and summer savory and roast. Salt lightly and serve with a gratin of eggplant. Drink a well-chilled Tavel.

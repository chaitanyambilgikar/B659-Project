Preheat oven to 350°F. Blend nuts, 6 tablespoons sugar and flour in processor until nuts are finely chopped. Add butter. Process until mixture begins to clump together, divide equally among four 4-inch-diameter tartlet pans with removable bottoms. Press mixture onto bottom and up sides of pans. Bake until crusts are golden and set, about 13 minutes. Transfer pans to racks; cool completely.
Combine wine, water and 1/3 cup sugar in large nonstick skillet. Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add bean. Stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat and boil until liquid is slightly thickened and reduced to generous 1/2 cup, about 5 minutes. Discard vanilla bean. Cool syrup to room temperature.
Combine cream cheese, preserves and 2 tablespoons vanilla syrup in processor; purée until smooth. Spoon filling into crusts; smooth tops. Refrigerate until set, about 1 hour. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Keep tartlets chilled. Cover syrup and let stand at room temperature.)
Transfer 2 tablespoons vanilla syrup into small bowl. Add apricots to syrup in skillet; toss gently to coat. Arrange apricot slices decoratively atop filling in crusts. Brush apricot slices with reserved 2 tablespoons vanilla syrup. Refrigerate tartlets 30 minutes. Serve chilled.

Gently heat jelly, bay leaves, and vinegar in a 1- to 2-quart saucepan over low heat, stirring, until melted. Remove from heat and let stand while preparing strawberries.
Trim strawberries and halve lengthwise, then transfer to a bowl. Reheat jelly mixture over low heat and pour over strawberries. Let macerate, stirring occasionally, 20 minutes. Serve berries and juices with ice cream, layered if desired.

Melt butter in heavy large pot over medium heat. Add sugar; stir until mixture turns deep golden, about 8 minutes. Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add bean and orange peel. Stir 1 minute. Add apples. Reduce heat to medium-low; cook until mixture is thick, golden and reduced to 2 1/4 cups, stirring often, about 40 minutes. Mix in honey. Cool to room temperature. Discard vanilla bean. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover; chill.)
Preheat oven to 375°F. Roll out 1 dough disk on floured surface to 12-inch round. Transfer crust to 9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom. Trim dough overhang to 1/2 inch. Fold overhang in and press, forming double-thick sides. Spread filling evenly in crust.
Roll out second dough disk on floured surface to 12-inch round. Cut into fourteen 3/4-inch-wide strips. Arrange seven strips diagonally atop filling, trimming ends of strips at tart pan edges. Form lattice by placing seven dough strips diagonally atop first seven strips; trim ends of strips at tart pan edges. Brush lattice with egg glaze.
Bake galette until crust is golden, about 55 minutes. Cool on rack. Serve slightly warm or at room temperature.

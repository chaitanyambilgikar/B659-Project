To make burgers: Combine first 9 ingredients in medium bowl. Add 3 tablespoons mayonnaise and mix well. (Can be prepared 6 hours ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
Mix breadcrumbs into salmon mixture. Form into four 1-inch-thick patties. Melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add salmon patties; cook until just firm to touch and brown and crusty, about 3 minutes per side.
To assemble: Place 1 slice of toast on each of 4 plates. Top each with burger. Spread burgers generously with mayonnaise. Top each with tomato slice, 2 radicchio leaves and second toast slice. Serve immediately, passing remaining mayonnaise separately.

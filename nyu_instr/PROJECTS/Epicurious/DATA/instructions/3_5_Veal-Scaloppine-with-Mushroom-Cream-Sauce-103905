Finely grind dried porcini in spice grinder or coffee grinder. Transfer 2 tablespoons ground porcini to heavy medium saucepan (reserve any remaining ground porcini for another use). Add wine, 1/2 cup shallots and vinegar to saucepan. Boil until porcini broth is reduced to 3/4 cup, about 5 minutes. Set aside.
Place dried morels in small bowl. Pour 2 cups hot water over; let stand until morels soften, about 30 minutes. Drain; reserve soaking liquid. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add fresh mushrooms and remaining 1/2 cup shallots and sauté until tender, about 7 minutes. Add drained morels and stir 3 minutes. Add porcini broth, 3/4 cup reserved morel soaking liquid and whipping cream; simmer until sauce thickens slightly, about 5 minutes. Season sauce with salt and pepper. Remove sauce from heat; cover to keep warm.
Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle veal with salt and pepper. Working in batches, add veal to skillet and cook to desired doneness, about 2 minutes per side for medium, adding more oil to skillet if necessary. Divide veal among 4 plates. Spoon mushroom sauce over veal and serve.
*Dried porcini mushrooms and dried morel mushrooms are available at specialty foods stores and some supermarkets.

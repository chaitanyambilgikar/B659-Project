Mix 2/3 cup orange juice, honey, 3 garlic cloves, minced thyme and orange peel in 13x9x2-inch glass baking dish. Add chicken breasts and turn to coat. Cover and chill overnight, turning occasionally.
Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat) or preheat broiler. Remove chicken from marinade; reserve marinade. Season chicken with salt and pepper. Grill chicken until cooked through, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer to plate.
Boil reserved marinade in heavy small saucepan until reduced to 1/4 cup, about 10 minutes. Cut oranges between membranes to release segments. (Chicken, reduced marinade and orange segments can be prepared 2 hours ahead. Cover separately and store at room temperature. Rewarm marinade before using.)
Whisk oil, vinegar, shallot and remaining 1/4 cup orange juice and garlic clove in small bowl to blend. Season dressing with salt and pepper. Combine greens, bell pepper and orange segments in a very large bowl. Toss with dressing. Arrange greens in center of large platter.

Pour pan juices into a 1-quart glass measure (do not clean roasting pan), then skim off fat and reserve fat and juices separately. (If using a fat separator, pour pan juices into separator and let stand until fat rises to top, 1 to 2 minutes. Carefully pour pan juices from separator into 1-quart glass measure and reserve fat left in separator.) If there is less than 1/4 cup reserved fat, add melted butter.
Straddle roasting pan across 2 burners. Add 1 cup giblet stock to pan and deglaze pan by boiling over high heat, scraping up brown bits, about 1 minute. Add to glass measure with remaining 3 cups giblet stock.
Whisk together reserved fat and flour in a 2-quart heavy saucepan and cook roux over moderately low heat, whisking, 3 minutes. Add hot stock to roux in a fast stream, whisking constantly to prevent lumps, then whisk in any turkey juices accumulated on platter and finely chopped giblets, if using. Simmer sauce, whisking occasionally, 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.

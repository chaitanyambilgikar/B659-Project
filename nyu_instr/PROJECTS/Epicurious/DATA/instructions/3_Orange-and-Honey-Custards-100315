Preheat oven to 325°F. Combine whipping cream, honey, egg yolks, grated orange peel and vanilla in medium bowl and whisk to blend. Divide custard among six 3/4-cup ramekins or custard cups. Place ramekins in 13 x 9 x 2-inch pan. Pour enough hot water into pan to come halfway up sides of ramekins. Cover pan loosely with foil.
Bake custards in water bath until just set in center, about 1 hour. Remove custards from water bath. Place in refrigerator until cold, about 6 hours. (Custards can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and keep refrigerated.)

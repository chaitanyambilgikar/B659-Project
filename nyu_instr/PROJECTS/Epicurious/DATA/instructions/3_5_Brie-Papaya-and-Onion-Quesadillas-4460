Preheat oven to 425°F. Heat oil in medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and jalapeño and sauté until onion is just tender, about 4 minutes; cool slightly.
Arrange 4 tortillas on heavy large baking sheet. Arrange Brie, then cilantro, papaya and onion mixture over tortillas, dividing equally. Top each with another tortilla, pressing to adhere.
Bake quesadillas until cheese melts and filling is heated through, about 8 minutes. Transfer quesadillas to plates; cut into wedges. Serve passing sour cream and salsa, if desired.

In a blender or food processor, blend yogurt cubes and bananas on high, scraping down sides every minute, until mixture holds together, 3 minutes. Add peanut butter; blend on high until mixture is creamy, like soft-serve ice cream. Stir in chips. Serve immediately, sprinkled with cinnamon, if desired.

Whisk lemon juice and minced garlic in medium bowl. Gradually whisk in olive oil. Season dressing to taste with salt and pepper. Arrange mushroom slices on serving platter, overlapping slightly. Sprinkle mushrooms with salt and pepper. Pour dressing over (mushrooms will soak up dressing). Sprinkle parsley, chives, and tarragon over mushrooms. Garnish with shaved Parmesan cheese and serve.

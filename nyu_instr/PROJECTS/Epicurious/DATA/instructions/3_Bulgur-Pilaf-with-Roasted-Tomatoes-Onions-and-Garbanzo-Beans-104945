Preheat oven to 400°F. Spread tomatoes and onion in large roasting pan. Drizzle with oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Roast 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in garbanzo beans and garlic. Roast until onion is golden, stirring occasionally, about 25 minutes longer. Remove pan from oven. Add 2 1/2 cups water to pan and stir, scraping up browned bits.
Transfer roasted vegetable mixture to large saucepan. Bring to boil. Stir in bulgur. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer until bulgur is tender and liquid is absorbed, about 10 minutes.
Stir 3 tablespoons parsley, 1 1/2 tablespoons dill and lemon juice into pilaf. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer to bowl. Sprinkle pilaf with remaining 1 tablespoon parsley and 1/2 tablespoon dill.
*Also called cracked wheat, bulgur is available at natural foods stores and many supermarkets nationwide.

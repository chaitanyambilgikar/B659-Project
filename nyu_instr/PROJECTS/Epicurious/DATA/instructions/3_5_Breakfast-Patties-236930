1. Place a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add the oil, flour, and soy sauce. Whisk well to combine.
2. Whisk in vegetable stock or soy milk and cook until thickened, continuing to whisk, about 2 minutes.
3. Remove from heat and add the oats, onion, sage, thyme, nuts, rice, and mushrooms. Stir well to combine and transfer entire contents to a medium mixing bowl. Allow to set at room temperature for 10 minutes, then refrigerate until cool enough to handle, about 20 minutes.
4. Preheat oven to 350°F.
5. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
6. Remove the mixture from refrigerator, and scoop 1/4 cup of mixture into a patty. Place on the lined baking sheet, and continue to scoop mixture into patties until done.
7. Bake for 20 minutes, and serve. If freezing, wrap each patty individually in plastic wrap.

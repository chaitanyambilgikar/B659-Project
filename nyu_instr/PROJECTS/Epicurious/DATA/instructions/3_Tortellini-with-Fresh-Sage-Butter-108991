Wash sage and dry well. Remove 6 leaves and cut into very fine julienne. Coarsely chop enough sage to get 1/2 packed cup.
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add tortellini and cook until al dente, about 8 minutes.
Melt 6 tablespoons butter in a large nonstick skillet. Add chopped sage, a pinch of salt, and freshly ground black pepper. Cook over medium heat until butter just begins to brown and bubble; the sage should get crispy.
Drain tortellini in a colander, saving 1/4 cup cooking water. Immediately put pasta in a large warm bowl, adding remaining butter. Toss with melted butter-sage mixture and add enough cooking water to make a smooth sauce. Add salt and pepper to taste and sprinkle with julienned sage. Divide immediately among warm pasta bowls.

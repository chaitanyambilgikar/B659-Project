In a bowl cream together the shortening and 1 cup of the sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy and beat in the eggs, 1 at a time, beating until the mixture is smooth. Into another bowl sift together the flour, the baking powder, and the salt and stir the mixture into the egg mixture alternately with the milk, stirring until the mixture is just combined. Stir in the walnuts and the zest, transfer the batter to a well-buttered 9- by 5-inch loaf pan, and bake the bread in the middle of a preheated 350°F. oven for 1 hour, or until a tester comes out clean. Transfer the bread in the pan to a rack and with a small skewer poke it all over. In a small bowl stir together the remaining 1/4 cup sugar and the lemon juice, pour the mixture over the hot bread, and let the bread cool.

Peel potatoes, then cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices with slicer. Rinse in 2 or 3 changes of cold water until water runs clear. Drain and pat very dry.
Heat fat in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until melted. Cook potatoes with 3/4 teaspoon salt, turning gently, until coated with fat. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, turning occasionally, until golden in spots and potatoes are tender, about 20 to 25 minutes.
Meanwhile, finely chop parsley and garlic together.
Gently stir parsley mixture into cooked potatoes.

Preheat oven to 400°F. Roll out 1 puff pastry sheet to 12-inch square on lightly floured surface. Line 8-inch square baking dish with 2-inch-high sides with pastry, leaving 1-inch overhang on all sides. Combine sugar and next 4 ingredients in large bowl. Add pears and toss well. Spoon pear mixture into prepared pastry. Dot top of pears with butter. Roll out second pastry sheet to 11-inch square. Brush overhang of bottom pastry with water. Top pie with second pastry sheet. Press pastry edges together to seal. Trim edges to 1/2 inch. Using small sharp knife, cut slits in top of pie for steam to escape. Bake until pastry is golden brown and pears are tender, about 1 hour. Serve warm or at room temperature.

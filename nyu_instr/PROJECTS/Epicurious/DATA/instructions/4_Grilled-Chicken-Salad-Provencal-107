Prepare barbecue (high heat). Combine first 5 ingredients in small bowl. Brush olive oil mixture lightly over chicken, zucchini, eggplant, crookneck squash and bell pepper. Grill chicken and vegetables until chicken is cooked through and vegetables are tender, turning occasionally, about 4 minutes. Transfer to large plate. Slice chicken breast diagonally. Arrange chicken and vegetables on plates, garnishing each serving with arugula and endive. Serve, passing balsamic vinegar separately.

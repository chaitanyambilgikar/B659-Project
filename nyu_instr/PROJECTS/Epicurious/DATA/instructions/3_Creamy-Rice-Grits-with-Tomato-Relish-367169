Mix tomatoes and shallot in a small bowl. Season with salt and pepper; set aside.
Bring 12 cups water to a boil in a large saucepan. Stir in grits and season with salt. Reduce heat to medium; simmer grits until almost tender, about 15 minutes. Drain, reserving 2 cups cooking liquid; return liquid and grits to saucepan. Stir over medium heat until creamy, 5–6 minutes. Add cheese and butter; stir to melt. Stir in lemon juice; season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a large wide bowl, forming a well in center. Stir oil into tomato mixture; pour into well.

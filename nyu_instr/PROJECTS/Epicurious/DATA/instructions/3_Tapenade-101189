In a colander rinse olives. Working with several olives at a time and using flat side of a large heavy knife, press olives to crush them, and remove pits. In a food processor pulse olives with oil until coarsely chopped. Tapenade may be made up to this point 3 days ahead and chilled in an airtight container.
Chop parsley and stir into tapenade.

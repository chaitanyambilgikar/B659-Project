Make soup: In a large heavy saucepan cook onion and rosemary in oil over moderate heat, stirring, until onion is softened. Add escarole, stirring to coat with oil, and cook, covered, 1 minute. Add broth and orzo and simmer, partially covered, stirring occasionally, 10 minutes.
Make meatballs while soup simmers: In a bowl combine well all meatball ingredients except oil and season with salt and pepper. Form mixture into meatballs about 1 inch in diameter. In a heavy 9-inch skillet heat oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and brown meatballs about 3 minutes (meatballs will not be cooked through).
Add meatballs to soup and simmer, partially covered, 5 minutes. Stir in garlic paste, lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste.

Preheat oven to 375°F. Brush twelve 1/3-cup (standard) nonstick muffin cups or six 1-cup (large) nonstick muffin cups with 3 tablespoons melted butter; dust with 2/3 cup cheese. Beat eggs to blend in large bowl. Beat in milk and green onions, then remaining 1/2 cup melted butter. Blend flour, salt, and remaining 1/2 cup cheese in medium bowl; gradually whisk into egg mixture (some small lumps may remain).
Divide batter among muffin cups. Bake popovers without opening oven until puffed and crusty brown, about 38 minutes for small and 48 minutes for large; turn out of pan and serve hot.

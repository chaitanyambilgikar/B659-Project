Preheat oven to 300°F. Grease large baking sheet. Sift flour and 1/3 cup sugar into large bowl. Add butter and lemon peel; rub with fingertips until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add lemon juice; press mixture with hands until dough holds together. Turn out dough onto lightly floured work surface. Divide dough in half. Gather each half into ball.
Place dough balls on prepared baking sheet, spacing evenly. Flatten each into 5 1/2-inch round. Crimp edges decoratively with fingertips or fork. Using sharp knife, score 6 wedges into each round. Pierce surface all over with fork. Bake until light brown and firm to touch, about 50 minutes. Cut into wedges along scored lines. Cool 10 minutes. Sift powdered sugar over shortbreads on baking sheet. Transfer to rack; cool. (Can be made 4 days ahead. Store in airtight container at room temperature.)

Chicken: Mix lemon juice, basil, oregano and garlic. Season chicken with salt and pepper. Heat oil over medium heat in a large skillet. Cook chicken 8 minutes; turn and cook 5 minutes more. Add lemon-juice mixture and stir up anything stuck to skillet. Reduce heat and cover; simmer until cooked through, about 6 minutes.
Potatoes: Heat oven to 450°F. Toss all ingredients in a roasting pan and cover with foil. Cook 20 minutes. Remove foil; cook 20 minutes more, stirring once.
Salad: Toast bread until very crisp, then rub each slice with 1 teaspoon garlic. Beat remaining 1 teaspoon garlic with anchovies, lemon juice, oil and salt with a fork in a salad bowl until well emulsified. Add lettuce; toss to evenly coat leaves. Grind black pepper over salad. Dice garlic toast and add croutons to salad. Toss again to mix well. Serve salad immediately.

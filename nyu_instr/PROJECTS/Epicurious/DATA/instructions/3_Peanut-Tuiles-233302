Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350°F. Line baking sheet with nonstick liner.
Combine butter, sugar, corn syrup, and cream in a 2-quart heavy saucepan and bring to a boil over moderate heat, stirring constantly. Add flour and salt and cook, stirring constantly, until batter is slightly thickened, about 1 minute. Stir in peanuts.
Working in small batches, drop level teaspoons of batter about 3 inches apart on lined baking sheet. Bake until golden and bubbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Cool on baking sheet on a rack 1 1/2 minutes. Quickly but carefully flip cookies over with spatula.
Working quickly, roll 1 cookie around handle of a wooden spoon and immediately slide cookie onto rack to cool completely. Repeat with remaining cookies. (If cookies become too hard to roll, return them to oven briefly.) Wipe down bakeware liner with a paper towel and bake and roll remaining cookies.

In a heavy kettle heat the oil over moderately high heat until it is hot but not smoking and in it brown the pork, patted dry, in batches, transferring it with a slotted spoon to a bowl as it is browned. Add the onions to the kettle, cook them, stirring occasionally, until they are golden, and stir in the garlic. Add the tomatoes with their juice, breaking them up, the water, and the pork with any juices that have accumulated in the bowl, bring the mixture to a boil, and braise the stew, covered, in the middle of a preheated 350° F. oven for 1 hour. Stir in the turnips and braise the stew, covered, for 20 minutes. Stir in the greens and the pumpkin and braise the stew, covered, for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the pumpkin is tender. Season the stew with salt and pepper and serve it with the rice.

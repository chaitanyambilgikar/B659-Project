Trim and cook artichokes: Squeeze juice from 1 lemon half into a large bowl of water, then drop same half into water.
Cut off artichoke stems and discard. Cut off top 1/2 inch of 1 artichoke with a serrated knife. Bend back outer leaves until they snap off close to base, then discard several more layers of leaves in same manner until you reach pale yellow leaves with pale green tips. Cut off green tips.
Trim dark green fibrous parts from base and sides of artichoke with a sharp paring knife, then rub cut surfaces with other lemon half. Drop artichoke into acidulated water.
Trim remaining artichokes in same manner.
Put 2 quarts water in a 4-quart pot and whisk in flour. Whisk in oil, salt, and remaining tablespoon lemon juice and bring to a simmer.
Add trimmed artichokes and simmer, partially covered, until just tender when pierced with a knife, 8 to 12 minutes. Drain in a colander, then invert onto paper towels to drain thoroughly. Pat dry.
When artichokes are cool enough to handle, pull out all pointed inner leaves and scoop out fuzzy choke with melon-ball cutter.
Stuff and fry artichokes: Heat 2 inches oil in a 4-quart heavy pot over moderate heat until thermometer registers 350°F.
While oil is heating, stuff each artichoke with 2 packed teaspoons cheese, pressing leaves around cheese.
Put eggs and bread crumbs in separate shallow bowls and divide salt and pepper between them, stirring them in. Dip each artichoke in egg, turning to coat and letting excess drip off, then in crumbs, turning to coat. Transfer to a tray.
Fry artichokes in 2 batches (returning oil to 350°F between batches) until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Transfer artichokes as fried to paper towels to drain, then cut in half.

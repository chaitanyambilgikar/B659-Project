Preheat oven to 400° F. and line twenty-four 1/2-cup muffin tins with paper liners.
Make filling: In a small bowl stir together filling ingredients until combined well. Filling keeps, covered and chilled, 1 week.
Make batter: Into a large bowl sift together flour, sugar, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg and stir in cereal. Add eggs, buttermilk, oil, and raisins, stirring just until combined well. Batter keeps, covered and chilled, 1 week.
Spoon 1 heaping tablespoon batter into each tin and top with 2 teaspoons filling. Spoon 1 heaping tablespoon batter over filling, spreading to cover filling completely. Bake muffins in middle of oven 20 to 25 minutes, or until a tester comes out clean.

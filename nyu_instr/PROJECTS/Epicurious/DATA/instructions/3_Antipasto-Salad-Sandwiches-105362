Combine salami, cheese, celery, and olives in large bowl; toss to blend. Mix mayonnaise and roasted peppers in small bowl to blend; season dressing to taste with salt and pepper.
Cut bread crosswise into 4 equal pieces. Cut each piece horizontally in half. Scoop out some soft center from each bread piece, leaving 1/2-inch-thick shell. Spread dressing in hollow of each bread piece. Divide salad mixture among bottom bread pieces. Top salad with radicchio; press bread tops over. (Can be prepared 4 hours ahead. Wrap sandwiches tightly in foil and chill.)

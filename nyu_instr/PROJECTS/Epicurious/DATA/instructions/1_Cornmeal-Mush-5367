Preheat oven to 350°F. Combine cornmeal, sugar, salt and pepper in heavy large saucepan. Pour reserved corn liquid into large measuring cup. Add enough water to measure 2 3/4 cups; whisk mixture into cornmeal. Add corn. Using wooden spoon, stir over medium-high heat until mixture is thick and begins to boil, about 10 minutes. Cool to lukewarm, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes. Mix in eggs. Spread in buttered 10-inch-diameter pie dish (or atop chili).
Bake cornmeal mixture in dish until firm to touch, about 40 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes. Cut into wedges.

Preheat oven to 350°F and generously grease 2 large baking sheets.
Cook brown sugar, butter, and corn syrup in a 1-quart saucepan over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until smooth. Remove from heat, then stir in flour and almonds.
Spoon scant tablespoons of batter 6 inches apart on baking sheets (4 cookies per sheet) and bake 1 sheet at a time in middle of oven until golden brown and bubbling, 6 to 8 minutes. (Cookies will spread to 5 to 6 inches.) Cool cookies on sheet 1 to 2 minutes. Quickly but carefully remove cookies from sheet with a metal spatula and transfer to a rack to cool completely. (If they become too brittle to transfer, return baking sheet to oven for about 1 minute to allow cookies to soften.)

Preheat oven to 500°F. Sprinkle hen halves with thyme, salt and pepper. Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add hen halves, skin side down, and cook until brown, about 6 minutes per side. Transfer hen halves to baking sheet (do not clean skillet). Roast until juices run clear when thigh is pierced, about 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, pour off all but 2 tablespoons fat from skillet. Add shallots and sauté over medium heat until soft, about 3 minutes. Add broth, wine, raspberries, 2 teaspoons sugar and allspice. Boil until sauce thickens enough to coat spoon, scraping up browned bits and crushing raspberries, about 12 minutes. Strain wine sauce into small bowl. Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper; add more sugar, if desired. Serve hen halves with sauce.

1. Place the sugar, oyster sauce, soy sauce, sake, garlic, ginger, and scallion whites in a large, nonreactive mixing bowl and whisk to mix. Stir in the short ribs. Cover the bowl and let the ribs marinate in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours.
2. Set up the grill for direct grilling and preheat to high; use the Mississippi test* to check the heat.
3. When ready to cook, brush and oil the grill grate. Place the short ribs on the grate and grill until sizzling and darkly browned on the outside and cooked to taste, 3 to 4 minutes per side for medium.
4. Transfer the ribs to a platter or plates, sprinkle the scallion greens on top, and serve.
*When the fire is burning on high, you will be able to count to only two or three Mississippis before the intense heat forces you to snatch your hand away.
Variation How to cook full-size Sweet Soy-Grilled Short Ribs:
You'll need about 3 to 4 pounds of bone-in individual short ribs. Make the marinade following the directions in Step 1, then marinate the short ribs for 3 to 4 hours. Set up the grill for indirect grilling and preheat to medium (325° to 350°F). When ready to cook, brown the ribs on both sides directly over the fire before moving them to the center of the grate, over the drip pan and away from the heat, and covering the grill. The ribs will be tender and cooked through after 1 1/2 to 2 hours. If the ribs start to brown too much halfway through cooking, wrap them in aluminum foil.

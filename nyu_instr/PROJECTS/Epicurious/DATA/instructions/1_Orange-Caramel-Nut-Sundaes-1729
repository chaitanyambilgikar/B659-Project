Remove orange peel with vegetable peeler. Cut enough peel into very fine strips to measure 2 tablespoons. Transfer strips to heavy medium saucepan. Add sugar, juice and butter. Stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat and boil gently until reduced to 1 cup, about 15 minutes. Cool sauce to lukewarm. (Can be prepared 2 days ahead. Cover sauce and oranges separately and chill. Reheat sauce to lukewarm before using.)
Cut white pith from oranges. Slice oranges into rounds; cut rounds into quarters. Scoop frozen yogurt into large wineglasses. Drizzle sauce over. Top with oranges and hazelnuts and serve.

Bring the liquid almost to a simmer with the salt over medium heat, then remove it from the heat and add the chocolate. Let it rest for 1 minute, then whisk the mixture until chocolate is melted and liquid is smooth. Stir in vanilla and taste it. If you want a stronger, deeper chocolate flavor, whisk in the cocoa. If necessary, reheat the liquid over medium-low heat, stirring.
If you like it frothy, or the cocoa powder didn’t blend in smoothly, blend it in the blender.
This recipe multiplies easily. When you get up to a quart of milk, use 1/4 teaspoon salt.

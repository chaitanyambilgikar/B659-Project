Peel potatoes and cut into 1-inch pieces. Generously cover with cold water in a medium saucepan and add 1/2 teaspoon salt. Simmer, partially covered, until just tender, about 12 minutes. Reserve 1 cup cooking water, then drain.
Cook onion and garlic in oil with 1/4 teaspoon salt in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until onion is just tender, about 8 minutes. Stir in red-pepper flakes and cook, stirring, 30 seconds. Add vinegar and cook until most of liquid has evaporated. Stir in potatoes, beans, octopus, tapenade, and 1/2 cup reserved cooking water and cook until just heated through. Remove from heat. Add more cooking water to moisten if necessary. Sprinkle with parsley and drizzle with olive oil.

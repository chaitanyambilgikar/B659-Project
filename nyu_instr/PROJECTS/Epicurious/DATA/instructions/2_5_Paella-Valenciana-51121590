1. In a saucepot over medium-high heat, bring the chicken stock to a boil and add the saffron. Reserve the stock warm over medium-low heat.
2. In a medium-size paella pan over medium-high heat, heat the oil. Add the chicken to the pan and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned, 5 to 6 minutes.
3. Add the peppers, carrots, onion, and chorizo, and sauté until the vegetables just start to tenderize, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the rice and toast, stirring frequently, until it just becomes translucent, 2 to 3 minutes.
4. Add enough of the warm stock to the pan to just cover the rice, and bring the liquid to a boil. Cover the pan, reduce the heat to medium, and simmer for 10 minutes.
5. Arrange the seafood and peas over the rice, add the lemon juice, re-cover, and continue simmering until the seafood is cooked through and shellfish have opened, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove the cooked paella from the heat and let rest for 5 minutes before serving. Serve with lemon wedges.

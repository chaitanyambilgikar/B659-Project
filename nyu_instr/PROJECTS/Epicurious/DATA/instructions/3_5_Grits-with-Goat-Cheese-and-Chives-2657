Bring broth and water to boil in heavy medium saucepan. Gradually stir in grits. Reduce heat to low; cover and cook 4 minutes. Uncover; simmer until thickened to consistency of thin mashed potatoes, stirring often, about 3 minutes. Add sliced chives and cheese. Stir until cheese melts. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Top with chive pieces.

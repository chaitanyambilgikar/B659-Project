Pat chops dry and sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.
Heat oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then sauté chops, turning over once, until golden and just cooked through, 6 to 7 minutes total. Transfer to a plate.
Add garlic to skillet and cook over moderate heat, stirring, 30 seconds. Stir in wine, tomatoes, rosemary, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and pepper and simmer, gently pressing on tomatoes until they collapse, about 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, cook orzo with saffron in a 3-quart saucepan of boiling salted water until al dente. Drain well in a sieve and return to saucepan, then stir in butter and cheese.
Reheat chops in sauce and serve with orzo.

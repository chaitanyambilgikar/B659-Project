The saddle is sometimes called the double loin or double rack. The best saddles are cut from the loin. Ask the butcher to remove all excess fat and the long, flat flank sections. The saddle should then be rolled and tied so that it looks trim. Rub well with freshly ground pepper, a little salt, and a bit of rosemary. Place on a rack and roast in a 325°F. oven, allowing about 12 minutes per pound, until the internal temperature has reached 145°F. Salt again just before removing from the oven. Let stand for 10 minutes in a warm place before carving.
Remove the strings which hold the roast together and with a sharp knife cut the meat in long, thinnish slices parallel to the spine. Run the point of the knife along the bone to loosen the slices. Repeat on the other side. Turn the roast over and remove the small filets on the underside. Slice them in rounds. Serve each person a long slice and one or two of the small slices from the filet, with some of the pan juices.
Potatoes Anna and lightly sautéd zucchini are excellent with this. Drink a good red Chassagne-Montrachet.
Variation Season the saddle well with rosemary and a little garlic. Roast as directed. Broil or roast at least one lamb kidney, trimmed and soaked in milk for 1 hour, for each serving. Carve the roast and garnish it with the kidneys and the rounds of the filet. Sprinkle with chopped parsley, buttered crumbs, and salt to taste. Serve with Hollandaise sauce seasoned with garlic and finely chopped anchovy filets to taste.

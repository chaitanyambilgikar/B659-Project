1. Combine the beef, salt, and water in a saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Let the mixture boil for 1 minute. Reduce the heat to low and let the water barely simmer for 20 minutes more, skimming off any scum that forms on the surface. Remove the pan from the heat and let cool.
2. Pour the liquid and the pieces of beef into the jar or container, cover it tightly, and let the liquid steep (like tea, of course) in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours.
3. Strain the liquid either through cheesecloth or a fine-mesh strainer and discard the beef. You'll be left with the tea. Serve hot.

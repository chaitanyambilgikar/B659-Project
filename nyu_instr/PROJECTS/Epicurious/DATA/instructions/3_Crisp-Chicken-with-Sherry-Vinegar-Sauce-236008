Put oven rack in upper third of oven and preheat oven to 450°F.
Pat chicken dry and sprinkle evenly with salt and pepper. 3Heat oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then sear skin side of chicken until golden brown, 4 to 6 minutes. Transfer chicken, skin side up, with tongs to a large shallow baking pan (reserve skillet) and roast until chicken is just cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes. Let chicken stand 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, cook garlic in reserved skillet over moderately high heat, stirring, until pale golden, 15 to 30 seconds. Add paprika, then immediately add vinegar, stirring and scraping up any brown bits, and boil 1 minute. Add broth and honey and simmer, stirring occasionally, until liquid is reduced to about 1/2 cup, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and whisk in butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, until incorporated. Season with salt and serve with chicken.

Preheat oven to 350°F.
Coarsely chop chocolate and in a small saucepan melt with butter over moderately low heat, stirring until smooth. Remove pan from heat and stir in sugar. Add eggs, beating with a fork until incorporated, and stir in flour and salt. Pour chocolate mixture over hot shortbread and spread evenly. Bake in middle of oven until a tester comes out with crumbs adhering, about 35 minutes. Cool completely in pan and cut into 24 bars. Bar cookies keep, covered, 5 days at room temperature.

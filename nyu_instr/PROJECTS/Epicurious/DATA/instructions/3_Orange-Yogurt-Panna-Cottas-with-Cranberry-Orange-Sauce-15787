Make panna cottas: In a bowl whisk together sugar, yogurt, vanilla, and zest until combined well. In a very small saucepan sprinkle gelatin over juice and let stand about 1 minute to soften. Heat mixture over low heat just until gelatin is dissolved. Whisk gelatin mixture into yogurt until combined well. Divide yogurt among four 1/2-cup molds. Chill panna cottas, covered, until firm, at least 4 hours, and up to 2 days.
Make sauce: In a small saucepan simmer juice, cranberries, and sugar, stirring occasionally, until cranberries are softened, about 7 minutes. In a blender purée mixture until smooth (use caution when blending hot liquids). Pour sauce through a sieve into a small bowl, pressing hard on solids, and discard solids. Cool sauce. Sauce may be made 2 days ahead and chilled, covered.
Run a thin knife around edge of each mold. Dip molds, 1 at a time, into a bowl of hot water 2 seconds and invert each panna cotta onto a plate. Serve panna cottas with sauce.

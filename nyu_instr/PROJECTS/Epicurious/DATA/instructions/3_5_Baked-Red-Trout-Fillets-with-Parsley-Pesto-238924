Make pesto: If using chile, heat a dry heavy skillet (not nonstick) over medium heat until hot, then toast chile briefly on all sides, pressing flat with tongs, until slightly softened, about 30 seconds total. Soak chile in hot water to cover 4 minutes, then drain.
With motor running, drop garlic into a food processor and process until finely chopped. Add parsley, oil, nuts, sea salt, 1/8 teaspoon pepper, and chile (if using) and purée until smooth. Transfer to a bowl and stir in lemon juice.
Bake trout: Preheat oven to 350°F with rack in middle. Brush bottom of a large shallow baking pan with 1 tablespoon oil. Put fillets, skin sides down, in baking pan and drizzle with lemon juice and remaining tablespoon oil. Sprinkle with sea salt, red-pepper flakes, and 1/4teaspoon pepper.
Bake fish until just cooked thourough, 12 to 15 minutes (depending on thickness). Serve fish with pesto.

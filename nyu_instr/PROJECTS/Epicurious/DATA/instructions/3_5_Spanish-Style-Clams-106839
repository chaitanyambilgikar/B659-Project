Heat olive oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add sliced sweet onions, green and red bell peppers, minced garlic, and bay leaves and sauté until onions are golden, about 10 minutes. Stir in crushed tomatoes and wine; season to taste with salt and pepper. Bring mixture to boil and add clams. Cover and cook until clams open (discard any clams that do not open), about 8 minutes. Stir in hot pepper sauce and serve.

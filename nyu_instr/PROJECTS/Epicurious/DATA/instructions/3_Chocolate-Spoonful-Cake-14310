Make cake layers: Preaheat oven to 375°F. Butter and flour two 9- by 2-inch round cake pans, knocking out excess flour.
In a double boiler or a metal bowl set over a pan of barely simmering water melt chocolate, stirring until smooth, and cool.
In a large bowl with an electric mixer beat together butter and sugars until light and fluffy. Bet in sour cream and vanilla until combined. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well with after each addition.
In a bowl whisk together flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt and gradually add to sour cream mixture, beating until just combined. Beat in chocolate until batter is just combined and divide between pans.
Bake layers in middle of oven until a tester comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool layers in pans on rack 10 minutes and invert onto racks to cook completely.
Make filling/frosting: In a double boiler or a metal bowl set over a pan of barely simmering water, melt chocolate, stirring until smooth, and cool to room temperature. In a large bowl with an electric mixer beat together sour cream, heavy cream, confectioners' sugar, and vanilla until thickened. Beat in chocolate until combined.
Make glaze: In a double boiler or a metal bowl set over a pan of barely simmering water, melt chocolate and butter, stirring until smooth, and cool.
Assemble cake: With a long serrated knife halve cake layers horizontally. Stack layers on a cake plate, spreading 1 cup filling/frosting between each layer. Spread side of cake with remaining filling/frosting.
Pour glaze on top of cake, spreading to just cover top, and coat side with chocolate chips and shavings, pressing them in gently.

Bring first 4 ingredients to boil in heavy large saucepan over high heat, stirring until sugar dissolves. Cook until reduced to sauce consistency, stirring occasionally, about 22 minutes. Strain sauce; cool. (Can be prepared up to 2 days ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
Arrange 1 nectarine, slices overlapping in circle, on each of 6 plates. Spoon sauce over, garnish with fresh mint sprigs and serve.

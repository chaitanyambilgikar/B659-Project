Trim bok choy and cut crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices. In a bowl stir together water and soy and oyster sauces. In a 10- to 12-inch heavy skillet heat oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and stir-fry bok choy with salt 2 minutes. Add soy mixture and butter and stir-fry until bok choy is crisp-tender, 1 to 2 minutes.

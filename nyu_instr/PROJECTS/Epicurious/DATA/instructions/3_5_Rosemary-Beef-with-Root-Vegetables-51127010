Heat oven to 450°F. In a bowl, toss potatoes, parsnips and carrots with 3 tsp rosemary, 3/4 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, 1 tablespoon water and 2 teaspoon oil. Coat a rimmed sheet pan with cooking spray. Rub beef with remaining 1 teaspoon olive oil and garlic; season with remaining 1 teaspoon rosemary, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Place beef on pan; spread vegetables around it in a single layer; roast, turning vegetables once, until beef’s internal temperature reaches 145°. (Start checking after 20 minutes.) Transfer meat to a plate; cover loosely with foil; let rest 5 minutes. Return veggies to oven; turn off heat. In a bowl, combine yogurt, horseradish and vinegar. Slice beef; divide among 4 plates; top with yogurt sauce and chives; serve with veggies.

Bring half and half to simmer in heavy medium saucepan. Add tea bags; remove from heat. Cover; let steep 30 minutes. Strain mixture through strainer into bowl; discard tea bags. Return half and half to same saucepan; bring to simmer.
Whisk egg yolks and sugar in medium bowl to blend. Gradually whisk in hot half and half. Return mixture to same saucepan. Stir over medium-low heat until sauce thickens very slightly, about 15 minutes (do not boil; sauce will be thin but will thicken slightly when cold). Cover and chill overnight. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Keep refrigerated.) Serve cold.

Cut off all peel and white pith from 3 blood oranges. Using small sharp knife, cut between membranes to release segments into small bowl (see below). Set bowl with blood orange segments aside. Cut remaining unpeeled blood orange into 8 pieces and place in food processor. Add fresh cranberries and 2/3 cup sugar; using on/off turns, blend until mixture is finely chopped. Transfer relish to medium bowl; stir in blood orange segments. Cover and refrigerate relish overnight. DO AHEAD: Cranberry relish can be made 2 days ahead. Keep refrigerated. Bring to room temperature before serving.

Preheat broiler. Blend teriyaki sauce and 1 teaspoon wasabi in medium bowl, adding more wasabi if desired. Transfer 3 tablespoons sauce mixture to small bowl and reserve. Mix scallops into sauce in medium bowl; let stand 10 minutes.
Thread 6 scallops onto each of 2 skewers. Thread all onions onto remaining 2 skewers by pushing 1 skewer through bulbs of all onions and another skewer (parallel to first) through all onions 2 inches above bulbs.
Place scallops and onions on broiler pan; brush with marinade. Broil until scallops are just opaque in center and onions are charred, turning occasionally and brushing with marinade, about 6 minutes total. Sprinkle with sesame seeds. Serve with reserved sauce mixture.

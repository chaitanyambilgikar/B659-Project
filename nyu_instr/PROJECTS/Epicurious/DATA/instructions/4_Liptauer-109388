1. Beat the cream cheese and cottage cheese together until they are very smooth. Add the capers, cornichons, paprika, salt, pepper, caraway seeds, and mustard. Mix together well and turn into a 1-quart bowl lined with plastic wrap for easier unmolding later. Smooth the top with a spatula and cover with the overhanging plastic wrap. Place it in the refrigerator to set.
2. When it has become cold enough to turn out — a few hours should do it — unwrap the folded-over plastic wrap on top, place a plate over the now uncovered bowl, turn it over, and unmold. Pull the plastic wrap off and drizzle over a rust-red ooze made by mixing the oil with the paprika.
3.Serve this with bread or poppy-seed bagels, gherkins, and, if you like, some chopped red onions.

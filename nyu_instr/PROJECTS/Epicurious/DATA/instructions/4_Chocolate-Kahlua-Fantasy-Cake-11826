Remove pan from heat and stir in butter, one piece at a time, until smooth. Pour mixture over crust in pan and chill, until firm, about 3 hours.
Make buttercream layer: In a saucepan cook sugar and water over moderately high heat, stirring occasionally, until sugar is melted.

Spread buttercream over chocolate layer and chill until firm, about 3 hours.

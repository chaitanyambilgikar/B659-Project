Remove outer celery stalks from each bunch, leaving about 6 inner stalks attached. Trim each celery heart to 6-inch length (reserve outer stalks and trimmings for another use). Bring large pot of salted water to boil. Add lemon juice, then celery hearts and boil until celery is tender, about 15 minutes. Drain well. Cover and chill until cold, about 2 hours
Whisk vinegar and mustard in small bowl. Gradually whisk in oil. Season with salt and pepper. Arrange lettuce leaves on 4 plates. Top with celery. Arrange 4 anchovies over each celery heart. Spoon dressing over. Top with parsley.

Cut ribs from chard; chop crosswise into 1-inch pieces (about 4 cups). Slice leaves crosswise into 1-inch strips (about 16 cups).
Melt butter with oil in large pot over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook until onion is tender, stirring occasionally, about 4 minutes. Add chard ribs; cover and cook until tender, about 6 minutes. Working in batches, add chard leaves and radicchio, stirring until wilted. Cook uncovered until vegetables are tender, stirring often, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in 2 tablespoons vinegar and currants, if desired. Season with salt and pepper and more vinegar, if desired.
Using slotted spoon, transfer chard mixture to bowl. Sprinkle pine nuts over.
What to drink: The general rule is red with meat and white with fish, but Pinot Noir is a light red wine and salmon is a rich fish, so it works. We like the earthy, fruity GAINEY VINEYARD 2007 PINOT NOIR Ccalifornia, $48).

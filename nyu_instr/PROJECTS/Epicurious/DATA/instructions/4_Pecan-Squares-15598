Preheat oven to 375°F. Combine 3/4 cup butter, powdered sugar and salt in processor. Process until moist clumps begin to form. Add flour and egg and process just until dough forms.
Press dough onto bottom and 3/4 inch up sides of 13 x 9 x 2-inch baking pan. Bake until crust is golden brown, about 22 minutes. Cool crust slightly. Maintain oven temperature.
Bring brown sugar, honey and remaining 3/4 cup butter to boil in heavy large saucepan, stirring frequently. Boil 2 minutes. Add vanilla. Stir in pecans. Pour pecan filling onto prepared crust. Bake until filling thickens and bubbles all over, about 25 minutes. Cool completely on rack. Cut into 2-inch squares. (Pecan squares can be prepared up to 1 day ahead. Cover and let stand at room temperature.)

Mix the couscous, ginger, and cayenne in a large heatproof bowl or storage container and pour 1 1/2 cups boiling water on top. Cover tightly and let sit until all of the liquid is absorbed, about 10 minutes. If the couscous is not quite tender, stir in an additional 1/4 cup boiling water, cover, and let sit for a few minutes longer. Fluff up with a fork, and let cool.
Meanwhile, place the arame in a bowl with ample cold water to cover and let stand until rehydrated, about 10 minutes. Rinse thoroughly and drain well.
Add the drained arame, carrots, radishes, and scallions to the couscous. Stir in enough sesame oil, shoyu, and vinegar to give the salad intense flavor. Stir in the sunflower seeds. Serve at room temperature. (Leftovers will probably need to be perked up with additional dressing.)

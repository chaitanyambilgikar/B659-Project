Preheat oven to 350°F. Season rabbit with salt and pepper. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large ovenproof pot over medium-high heat. Working in batches, cook rabbit until golden brown, 2–3 minutes per side. Transfer rabbit to a plate. Add remaining 2 tablespoons oil to pot. Add onions; sauté until beginning to soften, about 4 minutes. Add garlic, oregano, and basil; reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring often, until soft, about 3 minutes. Add wine; simmer until slightly reduced, about 2 minutes. Crush tomatoes by hand; add to pot with juices from can. Add 1/2 cup water; bring to a boil. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Return rabbit to pot; cover.
Transfer pot to oven and braise until meat is tender and almost falling off the bone, about 1 1/4 hours. Transfer meat to a platter. Reduce sauce in pot over medium-high heat until thickened, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Pour sauce over rabbit.

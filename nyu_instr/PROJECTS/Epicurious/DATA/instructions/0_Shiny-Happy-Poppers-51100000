Heat the grill to medium-high.
Stem the jalapeños and cut one lengthwise slit in each pepper. Pull out the seeds and inner ribs with your fingers (wear rubber gloves if your skin is sensitive to handling hot peppers).
In a medium-size bowl, combine the rice, black beans, mustard, garlic powder, and thyme. Stir until well mixed.
With an appropriately sized spoon, fill the jalapeños with the rice mixture. Place the peppers on a large sheet of heavy-duty aluminum foil. Drizzle the peppers with the olive oil and then with the hot sauce, to taste.
Fold the foil into a packet with the peppers in one layer. Grill the packet for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the peppers are soft and the rice filling is hot. Serve at once.

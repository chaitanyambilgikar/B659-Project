Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat) or preheat broiler. Whisk Sherry vinegar, lemon juice, lemon peel, thyme and marjoram in small bowl. Gradually whisk in olive oil. Season dressing to taste with salt and pepper. Arrange onion on baking sheet. Brush both sides of onions with dressing, using total of 4 tablespoons. Sprinkle onions with salt and pepper. Grill or broil onions until lightly charred, turning occasionally and keeping wedges intact, about 12 minutes. Transfer to plate and cool.
Place greens in medium bowl. Toss with enough remaining dressing to coat. Arrange greens on 1 side of each plate. Arrange onions on opposite side of plates. Drizzle onion with more dressing. Top with cheese and serve.

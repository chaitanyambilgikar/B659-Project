Stir together milk, oil, sugar, and yeast in a large bowl until blended. Let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. Stir in both flours, except additional all-purpose flour, and salt.
Turn dough out onto a floured work surface and knead until smooth and elastic, 8 to 10 minutes, adding just enough additional flour to keep dough from sticking.
Transfer dough to a lightly oiled bowl and turn to coat. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let dough rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.
Punch down dough and turn out onto work surface. Cut dough into 16 equal pieces and roll each into a 15- to 16-inch rope. Arrange ropes 1 inch apart on 2 greased baking sheets sprinkled with cornmeal and let stand, uncovered, 15 minutes.
Preheat oven to 400°F.
Brush breadsticks with egg white and sprinkle with seeds and kosher salt, pressing to adhere.
Bake in upper and lower thirds of oven, switching position of sheets halfway through baking, until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Transfer to racks to cool.

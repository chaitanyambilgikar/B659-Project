Cook pasta in a 6-quart pot of boiling salted water until just tender, then drain.
While pasta is cooking, toss tomatoes with salt to taste in a bowl and let juices exude.
Toss hot pasta with goat cheese in a large bowl until cheese is melted and coats pasta. Add tomatoes with juices, olives, basil, and salt and pepper to taste and toss to combine.

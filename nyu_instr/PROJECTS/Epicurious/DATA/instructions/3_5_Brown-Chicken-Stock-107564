In a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan, heat the oil until smoking. Add the chicken bones and scraps and brown all over, stirring to avoid burning. Remove the chicken parts and reserve. Add the carrots, onions, and celery and cook until soft and browned. Return the chicken bones to the pot and add 3 quarts of water, the tomato paste, peppercorns, and parsley, stirring to dislodge the browned chicken and vegetable bits from the bottom of the pan. Bring almost to a boil, reduce the heat, and cook at a low simmer for 2 hours, until reduced by half, occasionally skimming excess fat. After cooking, remove from heat and strain out all solids, pressing them with the bottom of a ladle to extract all liquids. This can be frozen for up to 1 month.

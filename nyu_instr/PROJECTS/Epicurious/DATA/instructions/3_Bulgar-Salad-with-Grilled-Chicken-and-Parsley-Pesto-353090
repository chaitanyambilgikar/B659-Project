Place 3 cups water and bulgur in medium saucepan; sprinkle with salt. Bring to boil. Cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until bulgur is tender but still slightly chewy, stirring occasionally, 11 to 12 minutes. Drain. Rinse under cold water until cool. Drain well. Transfer to large bowl.
Meanwhile, place parsley, almonds, shallots, and 1 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice in processor. Using on/off turns, process until parsley is coarsely chopped. With machine running, gradually add 1/2 cup oil and process to coarse puree. Season pesto to taste with salt and pepper.
Stir 3/4 cup pesto and remaining 1 tablespoon lemon juice into drained bulgur. Season to taste with salt and pepper and additional lemon juice, if desired. Prepare barbecue (medium heat). Brush chicken and apricot halves with oil.
Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill chicken and apricot halves until chicken is cooked through and apricots are slightly charred, 7 to 8 minutes per side for chicken and 2 minutes per side for apricots.
Line 4 plates with lettuce leaves. Divide bulgur salad among plates. Place 1 grilled chicken breast on each plate. Spoon dollop of pesto atop chicken. Divide apricot halves among plates and serve.

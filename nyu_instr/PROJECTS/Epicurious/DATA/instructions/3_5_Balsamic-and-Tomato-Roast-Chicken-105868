Preheat the oven to 200° C (400° F). Place the eggplant on the bottom of a baking dish and top each slice with a chicken breast. Combine the tomatoes, capers, balsamic, oil, and sugar and spread over the chicken breast. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through. Sprinkle with the basil leaves and pepper and serve with a rocket (arugula) salad.

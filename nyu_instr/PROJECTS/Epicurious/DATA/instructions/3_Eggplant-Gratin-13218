In a heavy skillet cook the onion in 2 tablespoons of the oil over moderately low heat, stirring occasionally, until it is golden. While the onion is cooking, in a steamer set over boiling water steam the eggplant, covered, for 10 minutes, or until it is tender, transfer it to a colander, and let it drain 5 minutes. In a bowl toss together the eggplant, the onion mixture, 1/3 cup of the parsley, and the salt and pepper to taste and spread the mixture in a greased 3-cup shallow baking dish. In a small bowl stir together the Parmesan, the bread crumbs, and the remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, sprinkle the mixture over the eggplant mixture, and drizzle the top with the remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Bake the gratin in the middle of a preheated 400°F. oven for 20 minutes, or until the topping is golden and the mixture is bubbling around the edges.

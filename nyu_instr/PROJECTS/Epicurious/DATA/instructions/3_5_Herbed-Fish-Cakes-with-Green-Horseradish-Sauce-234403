Line rimmed baking sheet with plastic wrap. Using/on off turns, finely chop 1/2 of fish in processor (do not puree to paste); transfer to bowl. Repeat with remaining fish. Mix in onion, parsley, cilantro, 3 1/2 tablespoons oil, salt, and pepper. Using wet hands and generous 1/4 cupful for each, shape mixture into 3x2x1/2-inch cakes. Arrange on prepared baking sheet. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.)
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in large skillet over medium heat. Working in batches, sauté cakes until opaque in center, adding more oil to skillet by tablespoonfuls as needed, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer to platter. Serve warm or at room temperature with horseradish sauce.

In a heavy saucepan cook the onion in the butter and 1 tablespoon of the oil over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until it is golden, add the corn, the tomato, the cream, and the water, and cook the mixture, covered, over moderately low heat, stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes. Season the corn mixture with salt and pepper and keep the mixture warm, covered.
Cut the okra into 1/4-inch-thick slices, in a bowl toss it with the seasoned cornmeal, and shake it in a coarse sieve to know off the excess cornmeal. In a deep skillet heat 1/2 inch of the additional oil over moderately high heat until it is hot but not smoking and in it fry the okra in batches for 1 to 2 minutes, or until it is golden, transferring it with a slotted spoon as it is fried to paper towels to drain. Serve the corn mixture topped with the fried okra.

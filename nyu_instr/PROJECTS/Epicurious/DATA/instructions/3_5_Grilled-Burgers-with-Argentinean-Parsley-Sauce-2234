Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Whisk parsley, olive oil, vinegar, garlic, 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper and oregano in small bowl to blend. Season sauce to taste with salt.
Combine beef, 1/2 teaspoon salt and remaining 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper in medium bowl; blend well. Shape beef into two 1-inch-thick patties. Grill beef until cooked to desired doneness, about 5 minutes per side for medium-rare.
Transfer beef to plates. Spoon sauce over and serve.

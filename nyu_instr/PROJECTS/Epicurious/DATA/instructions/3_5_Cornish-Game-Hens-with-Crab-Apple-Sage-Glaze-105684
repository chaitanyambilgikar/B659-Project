Preheat oven to 450°F. Starting at neck end of hens, slide fingers between skin and breasts to loosen skin. Place 2 sage leaves under skin of each breast half. Sprinkle hens with salt and pepper. Transfer hens, skin side up, to medium roasting pan. Roast hens 15 minutes. Meanwhile, simmer 1/3 cup wine, jelly, and shallots in heavy small saucepan until glaze is slightly thickened, about 6 minutes. Stir in chopped sage.
Brush half of glaze on roasted hens. Roast hens 5 minutes more. Brush with remaining glaze. Roast until hens are cooked through and glaze is bubbling, about 5 minutes longer. Transfer to platter.
Spoon off fat from juices in pan. Place roasting pan directly atop 2 burners over medium heat. Add remaining 1/3 cup wine and boil until liquid is reduced by 1/3, about 5 minutes. Season sauce with salt and pepper. Spoon over hens.

Combine breadcrumbs, sun-dried tomatoes, 2 tablespoons oil reserved from tomatoes and garlic in processor. Using on/off turns, process until tomatoes are coarsely chopped. Season to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be made 8 hours ahead. Cover and chill.)
Preheat oven to 375°F. Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper. Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons oil reserved from tomatoes in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken, skin side down, and cook until skin is crisp and golden, about 5 minutes.
Transfer chicken, skin side up, to heavy rimmed baking sheet. Spoon breadcrumb mixture atop chicken, dividing equally and pressing to adhere. Bake until chicken is cooked through, about 30 minutes.
Place chicken on plates and serve.

Prepare daikon and shrimp for Salad: Using slicer, cut daikon lengthwise into very thin slices (see cooks' note, below). Soak in a bowl of lightly salted cold water, chilled, 30 minutes.
While daikon soaks, toss shrimp with oil and 1/8 teaspoon pepper. Heat grill pan over medium-high heat until hot, then cook shrimp, turning once, until just cooked through, 2 to 4 minutes total. Transfer to a plate.
Make dressing: Whisk together mirin, vinegars, plum paste, soy sauce, and brown sugar in a medium bowl. Add oil in a slow stream, whisking. Stir in shiso leaves.
Assemble salad: Stir shrimp into dressing. Drain daikon well. Rinse and pat dry, then divide among 6 plates. Using a slotted spoon, top with shrimp. Serve drizzled with some of remaining dressing.

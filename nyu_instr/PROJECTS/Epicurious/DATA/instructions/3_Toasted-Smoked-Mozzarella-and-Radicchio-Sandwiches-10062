In a heavy skillet heat oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and sauté radicchio with vinegar, stirring, until wilted and tender, about 1 to 2 minutes. Season radicchio with salt and pepper and stir in parsley. Remove skillet from heat.
Preheat broiler.
On a baking sheet toast both sides of bread about 3 inches from heat until golden. Rub one side of each toast with garlic and season with salt. Divide radicchio among toasts, spreading evenly, and cover radicchio with mozzarella. Broil toasts until cheese is melted, 1 to 2 minutes.

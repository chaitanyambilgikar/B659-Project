1. Heat the goose fat or olive oil with the shallot and the garlic in a large skillet over medium heat. When the shallot has turned translucent, after about 2 minutes, add the mushrooms and cook, shaking the pan frequently, until they give up most of their liquid. Increase the heat to medium-high, season the mushrooms with salt and pepper and continue cooking and shaking the pan until most — but not all — of the liquid has evaporated. This will take about 8 minutes.
2. Mince the parsley and stir it into the mushrooms and continue cooking for an additional minute. Taste for seasoning, remove from the heat and serve immediately.

Preheat oven to 450°F.
Heat 2 tablespoons butter in a large heavy skillet over moderate heat until foam subsides. Stir in leeks and season with salt. Reduce heat to low and cook leeks, covered, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and keep warm, covered.
Purée remaining 4 tablespoons butter, garlic, 2 tablespoons parsley, and chopped snails in a food processor. Season with salt and pepper.
Put 1 scallop in each shell and arrange in a shallow baking pan. (Alternatively, arrange scallops about 1 inch apart in gratin dish.) Season scallops with salt and pepper, then dot each with 1 teaspoon snail-garlic butter. Bake in middle of oven until scallops are just cooked through, about 7 minutes (9 to 11 minutes if using gratin dish).
Serve scallops topped with leeks and sprinkled with chives and remaining tablespoon parsley.

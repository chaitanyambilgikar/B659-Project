Arrange a rack in upper third of oven; preheat to 425°F. Combine carrots and oil in a medium heatproof bowl. Season with salt and pepper and toss to coat. Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet, spreading out in an even layer (set aside bowl).
Roast carrots, turning occasionally, until just tender, 12-15 minutes.
Meanwhile, whisk honey and pomegranate molasses to blend in reserved bowl.
Transfer carrots to bowl with honey mixture; toss to coat well and spread out on baking sheet, scraping out any remaining glaze from bowl.
Roast carrots until glaze is reduced and sticky and beginning to brown in spots (but not burned), 5-8 minutes longer.

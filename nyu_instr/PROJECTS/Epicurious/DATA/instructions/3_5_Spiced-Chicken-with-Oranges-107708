Sprinkle chicken with salt, pepper, five-spice powder, and sesame seeds. Melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Sauté chicken until golden brown and cooked through, about 5 minutes per side. Using tongs, transfer to plate.
Add onion to drippings in skillet and sauté until tender, stirring often, about 3 minutes. Add orange juice, soy sauce, and pepper oil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 2 minutes, stirring often. Add oranges and stir until just heated through, about 1 minute. Return chicken to skillet to reheat if necessary. Divide onion-orange mixture among 4 plates, top with chicken, and serve.

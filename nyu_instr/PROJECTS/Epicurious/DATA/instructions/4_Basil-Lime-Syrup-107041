Bring sugar, zest, juice, and water to a boil, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Remove from heat and let syrup stand, uncovered, 15 minutes.
Discard zest and transfer syrup to a blender. Add basil and blend 20 seconds. Pour through a fine sieve lined with a rinsed and squeezed paper towel into a bowl or glass measuring cup, then cool.

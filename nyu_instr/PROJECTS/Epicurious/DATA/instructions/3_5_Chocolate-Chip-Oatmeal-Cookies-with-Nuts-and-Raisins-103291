Preheat oven to 350°. Using electric mixer, beat butter, shortening, both sugars, eggs and vanilla in large bowl until well blended. Sift in flour, baking soda and salt; beat to blend. Mix in oats, chocolate chips, nuts and raisins.
Spray baking sheets with nonstick spray. For each cookie, drop 1 rounded tablespoonful of dough onto sheet, spacing 1 inch apart (do not flatten dough). Bake cookies until golden but still slightly soft to touch, about 15 minutes. Cool cookies on sheets. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.)

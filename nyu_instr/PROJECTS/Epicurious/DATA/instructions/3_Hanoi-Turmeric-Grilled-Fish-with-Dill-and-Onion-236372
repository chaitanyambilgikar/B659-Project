Prepare fish: In small bowl, whisk together sugar, turmeric, salt, pepper, garlic, and shallot. Place in large sealable plastic bag with fish and refrigerate 15 minutes.
Make sauce: In medium bowl, whisk together fish sauce, lime juice, sugar, and 2/3 cup water until sugar dissolves, about 2 to 3 minutes. Set aside.
Prepare accompaniments: In heavy, 6-quart pot, bring 8 cups water to boil. Add noodles and boil until al dente, about 10 minutes. Drain in colander, rinse with warm water, and let drain completely.
Position rack in middle of oven and preheat to 400°F. Place rice cracker directly on rack and heat until golden, about 3 to 4 minutes. The cracker will blister as it toasts. When cool enough to handle, break cracker into shards and place on small plate.
Place peanuts in small bowl and arrange lettuce and herbs on platter.
Grill fish: Preheat grill (high heat). Grill fish, turning once, until cooked through, about 5 minutes total.
Meanwhile, place cast iron dish on grill over high heat.
When fish is cooked, place on heated dish, then top with onion and fresh dill. Immediately but carefully pour vegetable oil on top. This will create smoke coming up from food. Serve immediately with sauce and accompaniments.

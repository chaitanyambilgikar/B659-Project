Prick potatoes several times with a fork and put directly on oven rack in middle position. Put a sheet of foil on lower rack (to catch any drips) and heat oven to 450°F. Bake potatoes until soft when squeezed, 30 to 35 minutes.
Mash together butter, scallions, cilantro, salt, and pepper. Slit potatoes lengthwise and put some butter mixture in center of each.

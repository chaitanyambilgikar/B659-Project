Combine apricots, prunes and pecans in small bowl. Pour Cognac over. Cover mixture and let stand at room temperature 1 hour, stirring occasionally.
Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter 9-inch square baking pan with 2-inch-high sides. Line bottom with parchment. Butter parchment. Combine flour, baking powder and baking soda in medium bowl. Using electric mixer, beat unsalted butter and 2 cups sugar in large bowl until fluffy. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Mix in vanilla extract. Stir dry ingredients into butter mixture alternately with buttermilk, beginning and ending with dry ingredients. Mix in fruit with soaking liquid.
Transfer batter to prepared pan. Bake until cake is brown and crusty and tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Cool cake in pan 15 minutes. Turn cake out onto rack and cool completely. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Wrap tightly and store at room temperature.) Sprinkle with powdered sugar.

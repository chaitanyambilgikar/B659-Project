Sift flour, baking powder, and salt into a medium bowl. Using an electric mixer, beat eggs and sugar in a large bowl until pale yellow and thick, about 4 minutes. Beat in honey, vanilla, and orange zest. Gently fold in dry ingredients. Add 5 tablespoons melted butter; gently fold into batter. Press plastic wrap directly onto surface of batter; chill for at least 3 hours. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Keep chilled.
Position a rack in center of oven; preheat to 400°F. Lightly brush madeleine molds with butter. Place pan on a baking sheet. Drop 1 scant tablespoon batter into each mold. Bake until golden and a tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 10 minutes.
Remove pan from oven, invert, and quickly knock madeleines out of pan. Serve warm on their own or with Ginger-Yogurt Mousse with Pistachio Meringue .

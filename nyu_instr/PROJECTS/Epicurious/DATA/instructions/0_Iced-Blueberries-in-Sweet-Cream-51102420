We prefer to start with fresh blueberries rather than frozen ones, because many frozen berries are often processed improperly. To get started, sort your blueberries, setting aside any overripe ones for immediate snacking. The key is to freeze the berries flat, using a plate or baking sheet in the freezer. After the berries are frozen, they can be transferred to a bag and stored for up to six months.
While the berries are freezing, combine the egg whites and 1 cup of the milk in a pan on the stovetop, and bring to just under a boil, whisking all the while. Let it simmer for around 5 minutes, then add the honey and salt. After simmering for another minute or two, strain the mixture into a bowl. Add the remaining milk and sugar. Pour the sauce into a pitcher or serving dish and chill; it will thicken as it chills.
Pour the cooled sweet cream over the frozen berries to serve.

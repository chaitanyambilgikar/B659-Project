In a medium-sized bowl, mix together flour, baking soda, and salt. In a separate bowl, beat egg, sugar, and vanilla; then add butter to egg and sugar mixture and beat until light and fluffy. Add to dry ingredients and mix until blended. At this point you may also add 1/2 cup of coarsely chopped walnuts.
Divide cookie dough into two parts and roll in wax paper. Freeze overnight, or at least 4 hours. With a serrated knife, carefully cut frozen dough into slices about 1/4 inch thick. Bake on cookie sheet for 10 to 12 minutes at 350 degrees. Makes about 2 dozen cookies.

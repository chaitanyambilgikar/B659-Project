Heat oil in heavy large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add sausage and garlic and sauté until sausage is lightly browned, about 8 minutes. Add escarole and toss until wilted, about 5 minutes. Add broth and cannellini with their juices. Simmer until flavors blend and soup thickens slightly, about 20 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Ladle soup into bowls. Serve with Parmesan cheese.

1. Trim the leek greens in a "V" to within 3 inches of the white bulb, leaving roots intact. Cut a slit from the top of the green to within 3 inches of the bottom of the bulb. To remove sand, soak leeks for 1 hour in a bowl of water and the white vinegar. Rinse well under cold running water.
2. Cook the leeks in a large pot of boiling, salted water for about 8 minutes or until the bulbs are tender. Drain well, cut off the roots and pat dry.
3. Heat the oil in a large skillet. Add the leeks and cook for 5 minutes or until golden, shaking the pan.
4. Stir in remaining ingredients; cover and heat through before serving.
5. Transfer the leeks to a serving platter and spoon their cooking liquid atop; cool. Serve the leeks with crusty bread, soft cheese, and a crisp, green salad.

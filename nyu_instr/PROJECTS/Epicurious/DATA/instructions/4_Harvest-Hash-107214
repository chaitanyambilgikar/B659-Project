Peel potato and cut into 1/2-inch cubes. Bring a 5- to 6-quart pot of salted water to a boil and cook potato until crisp-tender, about 5 minutes, then transfer with a slotted spoon to a colander. Cook parsnips and squash together in same boiling water until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes, then drain in colander.
Heat butter in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat, swirling skillet occasionally, until foam subsides and butter begins to brown, about 2 minutes. Add shallots and garlic and sauté, stirring occasionally, until shallots are golden brown, about 5 minutes. Add parcooked vegetables, salt, and pepper and sauté, stirring occasionally, until browned and tender, about 7 minutes. Stir in sage to taste.

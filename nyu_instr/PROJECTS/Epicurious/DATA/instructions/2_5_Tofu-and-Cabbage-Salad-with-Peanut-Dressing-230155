Heat oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Pat tofu strips dry, then sauté until light brown (about 4 minutes per side). Combine vegetables in a large bowl. In a medium bowl, mix dressing ingredients with 2 tbsp water (puree in blender for a smoother texture). Pour 3/4 dressing over vegetables and toss. Top salad with tofu strips and drizzle on remainder of dressing.

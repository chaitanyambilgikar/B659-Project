In an 8-to-9 quart kettle combine chicken, vegetables, salt, pepper, and enough water to cover chicken completely. Bring mixture to a boil, skimming any foam that rises to surface, and simmer, covered, 2 1/2 hours.
Remove kettle from heat and let chicken cool completely, uncovered, in poaching liquid. Remove chicken from liquid and shred, discarding bones.
Marinate chicken: Drizzle 2 tablespoons oil over bottom of a 4-to-6 cup terrine and cover with one-third chicken, a few sage leaves, a few garlic cloves, salt, and pepper. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons more oil and continue layering, making at least 3 layers, in same manner. Pour enough remaining oil into terrine to cover chicken. Lay a sheet of plastic wrap on surface of chicken and chill terrine at least 1 day and up to 3 days. Let terrine stand at room temperature 1 hour before serving.
Pour off about 3 tablespoons oil from terrine and in a large bowl toss it with mesclun and sail and pepper to taste. Spoon chicken mixture over greens.

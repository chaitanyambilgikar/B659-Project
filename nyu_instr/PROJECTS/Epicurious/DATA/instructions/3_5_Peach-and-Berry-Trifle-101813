Mix first 5 ingredients in large bowl and toss to blend; let stand 10 minutes. Beat chilled cream in another large bowl until stiff peaks form.
Arrange 16 ladyfingers in 10- to 12-cup glass bowl or trifle dish to cover bottom. Spread with 1/3 cup raspberry jam. Top with 2 cups fruit mixture, then 2 cups whipped cream. Repeat layering 2 more times with ladyfingers, raspberry jam, fruit mixture and cream. Garnish with whole strawberries, if desired.
Refrigerate trifle at least 2 hours and up to 6 hours before serving.

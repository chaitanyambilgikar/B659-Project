Preheat oven to 375°F.
Rub eggplant with 2 tablespoons oil and bake, cut sides down, in a small baking pan in middle of oven until flesh is browned and very tender, about 50 minutes.
Scoop flesh from eggplant into a food processor, discarding skin, and purée with olives, capers, remaining 2 tablespoons oil, and salt and pepper to taste.

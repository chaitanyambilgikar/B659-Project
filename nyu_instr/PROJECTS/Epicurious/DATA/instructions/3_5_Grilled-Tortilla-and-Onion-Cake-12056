Prepare grill
On a rack set about 5 inches over glowing coals toast tortillas lightly a few at a time, turning them once, until they begin to puff on each side but are still soft. Alternatively, tortillas may be toasted on a stove-top griddle over moderately high heat.
In a large non-stick skillet cook onions in oil over moderately low heat, stirring occasionally, until soft, about 15 minutes. Transfer onions to a bowl and cool. Stir in parsley, Parmesan, 1/2 cup mayonnaise, and salt and pepper to taste.
Spread onion mixture on 11 tortillas, stacking them, and top the stack with remaining tortilla. Wrap cake well in plastic wrap and chill at least 1 hour and up to 4 hours.
Discard plastic wrap and with large sharp knife cut cake into 3/4-inch-wide slices (not wedges). Turn each slice onto its side and secure ends and middle with wooden picks.
In a small bowl stir together vinegar and remaining 1/4 cup mayonnaise and brush some of mixture on a cut side of each slice.
Grill slices, mayonnaise sides down, until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Brush tops with remaining mayonnaise mixture, turn slices, and grill until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes more.
Alternatively, broil slices on rack of broiler pan about 4 inches from heat, mayonnaise sides up, until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn slices and brush tops with remaining mayonnaise. Broil until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes more.
Discard wooden picks

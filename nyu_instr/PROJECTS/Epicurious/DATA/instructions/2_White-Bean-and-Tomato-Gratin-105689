Combine 12 cups water, beans, thyme sprigs, bay leaves, and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt in large pot. Bring to boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer until beans are tender, about 1 hour 45 minutes. Drain. Discard thyme sprigs and bay leaves.
Transfer beans to 13x9x2-inch glass baking dish. Add canned tomatoes with juices, sun-dried tomatoes, 2 tablespoons oil, 1 tablespoon chopped thyme, 3/4 teaspoon pepper, and 3/4 teaspoon salt. Toss gently to blend. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cool slightly. Cover and refrigerate.)
Preheat oven to 350°F. Mix breadcrumbs, lemon peel, and remaining 1/2 tablespoon chopped thyme in small bowl. Sprinkle over beans. Drizzle remaining 1 tablespoon oil over. Bake until juices are bubbling around edges and breadcrumbs are golden, about 55 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.

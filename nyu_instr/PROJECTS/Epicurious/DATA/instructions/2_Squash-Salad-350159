1. Cut the zucchini and squash in thin slices on the diagonal; place in a bowl.
2. Prepare the dressing: Whisk the vinegar, mustard, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Slowly drizzle in the oil, whisking constantly until thickened. Toss with the squash. Let rest 10 minutes.
3. Place the arugula in a salad bowl. Cut the tomato in half lengthwise and then into very thin wedges; scatter over the greens.
4. Before serving, spoon the squash and dressing over arugula. Sprinkle with parsley and season with salt and pepper. Serve immediately, tossing at the table.

In a blender blend olives, roasted pepper, garlic, mustard, vinegar, lemon juice, with salt and pepper to taste until smooth. With motor running, add 3 tablespoons oil in a stream and blend vinaigrette until emulsified.
Discard small tough muscle from side of each scallop if necessary and in a small bowl toss scallops with remaining tablespoon oil and salt and pepper to taste.
Heat a well-seasoned ridged grill pan over high heat until hot and grill scallops until just cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Transfer scallops to a plate and keep warm. Grill tomatoes over high heat until tender and lightly charred, 1 to 2 minutes on each side.
Toss arugula with half the vinaigrette and divide between 2 plates. Top arugula with scallops and tomatoes and serve with remaining vinaigrette if desired.

Combine the flour, butter, sugar, and salt in a food processor and pulse until the butter resembles small peas. Drizzle in the cream a little at a time, pulsing until the dough just comes together. Add more cream if needed.
(To make by hand, cut the butter into the dry ingredients until it resembles small peas, using a pastry cutter. Sprinkle with the cream and work the dough together using a wooden spoon or rubber spatula.)
Turn the dough out onto a clean work surface and gently pat it into a flat disk. Wrap in plastic and chill for at least 30 minutes.

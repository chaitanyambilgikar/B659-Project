Preheat oven to 300°F. and butter a 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass baking dish. Into a large bowl sift together sugar, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt and whisk in oil, eggs, and vanilla until smooth. Peel and core apples and slice about 1/4 inch thick (there should be about 6 cups). Coarsely chop walnuts. Add apples and walnuts to batter and stir until coated well. Stir in flour just until combined well and spread batter evenly in baking dish.
Bake cake in middle of oven 1 hour and 40 to 50 minutes, or until a tester comes out clean, and cool completely in baking dish on a rack. Cake keeps, wrapped in plastic wrap and chilled, 1 week.
Cut apple walnut cake into squares and serve at room temperature with ice cream or whipped cream.

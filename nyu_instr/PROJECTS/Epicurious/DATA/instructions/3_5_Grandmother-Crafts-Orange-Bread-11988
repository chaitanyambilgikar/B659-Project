Make the candied orange zest: Cut oranges lengthwise into eighths and peel, reserving flesh for another use. With a sharp knife remove white pith, leaving zest. In a saucepan combine zest with enough cold water to cover and simmer 10 minutes. Drain zest in a colander and return to pan. Add enough cold water to cover zest and simmer 10 minutes more. Drain zest in colander. In pan combine zest, sugar, and 1/4 cup water and cook over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until sugar is dissolved. Cook zest mixture at a bare simmer, stirring occasionally, until syrup is thickened, about 15 minutes. Remove zest from syrup with tongs and transfer to a rack to cool and dry completely (overnight if necessary). Candied orange zest may be made 2 days ahead and stored in an airtight container. Chop zest fine.
Preheat oven to 375°F. and lightly grease and flour a loaf pan, 9 1/4 by 5 1/4 by 2 3/4 inches, knocking out excess flour.
In a large bowl whisk together sugar, flour, baking powder, and salt. Transfer 1 tablespoon mixture to a small bowl and stir in candied zest. In another small bowl whisk together egg, milk, and butter and add to flour mixture, stirring until just combined. Stir in zest mixture (batter will be very thick). Transfer batter to pan, smoothing top, and bake bread in middle of oven 50 minutes, or until a tester inserted in center comes out clean. Cool bread in pan on a rack 10 minutes and turn out onto rack to cool completely.

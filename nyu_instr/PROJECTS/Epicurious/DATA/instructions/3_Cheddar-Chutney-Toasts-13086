Preheat broiler.
On a baking sheet arrange bread slices in one layer and broil about 4 inches from heat until golden, 1 to 2 minutes on each side.
In a small bowl stir together chutney and mustard and spread on one side of each toast. Divide Cheddar evenly among toasts and broil until cheese is melted and golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Serve toasts immediately.

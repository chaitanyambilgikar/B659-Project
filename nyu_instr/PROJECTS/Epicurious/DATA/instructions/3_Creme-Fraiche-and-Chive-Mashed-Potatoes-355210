Heat milk, crème fraîche, and butter in saucepan over medium heat, just until bubbles begin to form at edge, stirring until butter melts. Gradually mix hot milk mixture into potatoes. Fold in chives. Season with coarse salt and pepper. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 hour ahead. Let stand at room temperature. Reheat in microwave-safe bowl.

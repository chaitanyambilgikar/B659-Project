For dipping sauce: Whisk mayonnaise, Worcestershire sauce, olive oil, sesame oil, honey, lemon juice, and seasoned salt in small bowl to blend well. Cover and refrigerate until cold.
For artichokes: Fill large bowl with cold water; add lemon juice. Cut off stem and top quarter of 1 artichoke. Bend back dark green outer leaves and snap off at artichoke base until only pale green and yellow leaves remain. Cut any dark green areas off base. Cut artichoke lengthwise into 6 wedges. Place artichoke wedges in lemon water. Repeat with remaining artichokes.
Steam artichokes until tender, about 30 minutes. Cool. Remove choke and any purple-tipped leaves from center of artichoke wedges. (Dipping sauce and artichokes can be prepared 1 day ahead. Keep sauce refrigerated. Cover artichokes and refrigerate.)
Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Stir olive oil and minced garlic in small bowl to blend. Brush garlic oil over artichokes. Sprinkle artichokes with salt and pepper. Grill artichokes until slightly charred, turning occasionally, about 8 minutes.
Transfer artichokes to platter and serve with dipping sauce.

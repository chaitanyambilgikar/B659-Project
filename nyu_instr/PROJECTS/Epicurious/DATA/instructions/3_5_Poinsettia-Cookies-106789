1. Cream butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer. Add confectioners' sugar; beat well. Beat in the egg and extracts. Blend in the flour and salt. Form the dough into two disks and wrap them in plastic. Chill the dough well.
2. Remove one disk from the refrigerator. Roll dough out on a lightly floured surface to 1/8-inch thickness. Cut into 1 1/2-inch squares, then cut from each corner of the square almost to the center. Turn over every other cut point to the center and press gently, forming a pinwheel (or poinsettia). Sprinkle the center of each with red sugar. Repeat with the second disk of dough.
3. Preheat oven to 350°F. Place the cookies on greased baking sheets and bake until very lightly golden, about 8 to 10 minutes.

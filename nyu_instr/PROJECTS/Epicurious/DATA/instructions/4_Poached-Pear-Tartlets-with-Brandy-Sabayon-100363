Trace outline of 1 pear half onto a piece of parchment paper. Cut out pear template. Set template aside.
Mix 5 cups apple juice, brown sugar, molasses, ginger, cinnamon and nutmeg in heavy large saucepan. Cover and bring to simmer. Add pears and return mixture to simmer. Reduce heat. Cover and simmer slowly until pears are tender when pierced with knife, about 20 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer pears to plate. Boil poaching liquid in saucepan until reduced to generous 1 cup, about 25 minutes. Set aside.
Preheat oven to 375°F. Line baking sheet with parchment paper. Place cold pastry on work surface. Using template as guide, cut 8 pear shapes from pastry. Place pastry cutouts on prepared baking sheet. Brush with egg glaze; sprinkle each with 1/2 teaspoon sugar. Bake until pastry is golden, about 15 minutes. Cool on baking sheet.
Transfer 1/2 cup pear poaching liquid to large metal bowl. Whisk in egg yolks and 2 tablespoons brandy. Set bowl over saucepan of simmering water (do not allow bowl to touch water). Using handheld electric mixer, beat until sabayon is thick and foamy and thermometer registers 160°F, about 4 minutes. Remove bowl from over water. (Pears, poaching liquid, pastries and sabayon can be prepared 1 day ahead. Store pastries in airtight container. Cover pears, poaching liquid and sabayon separately and refrigerate. Before serving, bring poaching liquid to room temperature. Rewarm sabayon in glass bowl in microwave on high for about 1 minute, whisking every 10 seconds.)
Preheat oven to 350°F. Rewarm pastries in oven for 5 minutes. Place 1 pastry on each plate. Arrange 1 poached pear half off-center atop each pastry. Spoon reduced poaching liquid around pastries. Spoon sabayon atop pears.

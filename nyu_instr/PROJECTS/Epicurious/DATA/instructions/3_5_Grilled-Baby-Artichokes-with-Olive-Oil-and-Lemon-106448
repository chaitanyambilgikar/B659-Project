Squeeze juice from lemon into bowl of cold water. Cut stem off 1 artichoke, leaving about 1 inch. Snap off bottom 3 rows of leaves. Cut off tip of artichoke. Halve artichoke lengthwise. Scrape out choke. Place in lemon water. Repeat with remaining artichokes.
Bring large pot of salted water to boil. Add artichokes and boil until crisp-tender, about 6 minutes. Drain; pat dry.
Prepare barbecue (medium heat). Mix oil and 1/3 cup lemon juice in small bowl. Brush artichokes with some of dressing. Grill until tender and charred in spots, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer to large bowl. Mix in dressing. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer artichokes to platter. Pour dressing into small bowl. Serve artichokes warm or at room temperature, offering dressing alongside. (Can be made 4 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.)

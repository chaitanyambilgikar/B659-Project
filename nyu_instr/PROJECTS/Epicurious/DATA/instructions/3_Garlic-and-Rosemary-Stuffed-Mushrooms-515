Preheat oven to 400°F. Peel outer papery skin from garlic head. Cut off top 1/3 inch to expose garlic cloves. Place garlic head, cut side up, in small ramekin. Drizzle 1 1/2 tablespoons oil over. Wrap ramekin in double thickness of foil. Place in oven; roast garlic 30 minutes. Open top of foil, exposing garlic. Continue to roast garlic until golden, about 20 minutes. Remove from oven; cool.

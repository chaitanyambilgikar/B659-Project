Preheat oven to 400°F. and brush a baking sheet well with oil.
Peel potato and trim to form a rectangle about 3 by 1 1/2 by 1 inch. Halve rectangle through 1 -inch side to form 2 rectangles about 3 by 1 1/2 by 1/2 inches. With a mandoline or other hand-held slicing device slice potato 1/16 inch thick on the long narrow side of each rectangle to form strips about 3 by 1/2 inches. On oiled sheet arrange strips, 4 at a time, overlapping ends to form squares. Brush each square with oil and sprinkle with salt to taste.
Bake crisps in middle of oven 10 minutes, or until golden brown. Transfer crisps to a rack to cool. Potato crisps keep in an airtight container 3 days.

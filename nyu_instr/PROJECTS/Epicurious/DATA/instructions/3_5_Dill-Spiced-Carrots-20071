Scrape and trim the carrots and quarter them lengthwise. Simmer them in the dill pickle juice until they can be easily pierced with a fork, about 20 to 25 minutes. They will not soften, but will stay pleasantly crunchy. Chill overnight in the pickle juice.
To serve, drain off the liquid and sprinkle the herbs on the carrots. Pass the sour cream in a separate bowl. Dill-Spiced Carrots should not be served on lettuce, but used as a salad garnish for cold chicken or a platter of cold cuts.

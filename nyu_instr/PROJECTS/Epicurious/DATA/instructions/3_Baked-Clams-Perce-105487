Bring 1 cup water to a boil in a 4-quart heavy pot, then add clams and cook, covered, stirring occasionally, until clams just open, 4 to 8 minutes, checking frequently after 4 minutes. (Discard any clams that haven't opened after 8 minutes.) Transfer clams as they open with a slotted spoon to a bowl and discard cooking water.
Preheat broiler.
Shuck clams and reserve 24 half shells. Scrub reserved shells inside and out, then dry.
Return clams to shells and arrange in a shallow (1-inch-deep) baking pan.
Divide stuffing and cheese among clams and top each with a piece of bacon and a drop of Worcestershire sauce.
Broil clams 5 to 6 inches from heat until bacon is cooked and stuffing is golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Serve immediately.

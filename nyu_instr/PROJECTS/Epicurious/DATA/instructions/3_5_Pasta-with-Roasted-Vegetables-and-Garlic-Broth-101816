Preheat oven to 400°F. Mix first 6 ingredients in large bowl. Spread vegetables and garlic on baking sheet. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Roast until just tender, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes.
Peel garlic and place in medium saucepan. Add broth and simmer until reduced by half, about 10 minutes.
Combine roasted vegetables, garlic-broth mixture, cheese, basil and pasta in large pot. Toss over low heat until sauce coats pasta but remains slightly soup-like. Season with salt and pepper.

Place sun-dried tomatoes in small bowl. Pour enough hot water over to cover tomatoes; let stand until softened, about 5 minutes. Drain. Return tomatoes to bowl; stir in 1/4 cup Parmesan and oil.
Cook potatoes in large pot of boiling salted water until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain. Return potatoes to pot. Stir over medium heat until excess moisture evaporates, about 1 minute. Remove from heat. Add milk, half and half, 2 tablespoons butter, salt, nutmeg and pepper to potatoes. Mash until smooth.
Butter 8x8x2-inch glass baking dish. Spread half of mashed potatoes in prepared dish. Sprinkle sun-dried tomato mixture over. Spread remaining mashed potatoes over. Sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan. Dot with remaining 1 tablespoon butter. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
Preheat oven to 400°F. Bake potatoes uncovered until heated through and top is golden brown, about 35 minutes (or up to 45 minutes if refrigerated).

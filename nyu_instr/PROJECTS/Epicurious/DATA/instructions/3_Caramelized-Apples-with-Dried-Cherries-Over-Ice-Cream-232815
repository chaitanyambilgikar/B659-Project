Heat butter in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until foam subsides, then sauté apples and dried cherries, stirring and turning over occasionally, until apples are just beginning to brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Add sugar, salt, and 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice. Increase heat to high and cook, stirring, until juices are deep golden, about 5 minutes. Add cream and boil, stirring, 1 minute. Remove from heat and cool to warm, about 15 minutes. Stir in remaining teaspoon lemon juice, or to taste. Serve hot or warm over ice cream.

1. Preheat the oven to 250°F.
2. In a bowl combine the zest, olive oil, bread crumbs, parsley, tarragon, mustard seeds, vinegar, lemon juice, mustard, and sugar substitute. Line a baking pan with parchment paper and place the fish in the pan, skin side down. Sprinkle with pepper.
Spread some of the lemon-herb mixture on each fillet.
3. Bake the char for 30 to 35 minutes, depending on thickness, until the fish is almost completely opaque. Allow to rest for 5 minutes before serving.

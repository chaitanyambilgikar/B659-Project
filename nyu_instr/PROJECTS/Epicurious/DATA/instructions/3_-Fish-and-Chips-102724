Preheat oven to 375°F.
Stir together crème fraîche, zest, chives, and salt to taste. Chill topping until ready to use. Brush 2 large baking sheets generously with some oil. Cut potatoes crosswise on a slight diagonal into 1/8 -inch-thick slices with mandoline. Cut out 80 potato stars with cutter and arrange in 1 layer on baking sheets. Brush tops with more oil and season with salt.
Bake stars in batches in middle of oven until golden and crisp, about 10 minutes (stars may curl). Immediately transfer stars carefully with a metal spatula to paper towels to drain and cool (stars will continue to crisp).
Serve stars topped with crème fraîche and caviar.

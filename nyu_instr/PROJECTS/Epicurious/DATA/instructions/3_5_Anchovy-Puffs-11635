In a small bowl with a fork mash anchovies with mayonnaise. On a lightly floured surface roll out both sheets of pastry into 14-inch squares and trim edges to form 13-inch squares. Brush off excess flour and spread anchovy mayonnaise evenly over 1 pastry sheet. Cover with remaining pastry sheet and press sheets together gently.
Preheat oven to 375°F.
With a 3- to 4-inch decorative cutter, such as a fish, cut pastry into shapes. Reserve scraps and cut into bite-size pieces to bake separately. (To eliminate scraps forego decorative shapes altogether and simply cut pastry into squares.)
Arrange pastries on lightly greased baking sheets and brush tops with egg wash. With the edge of a cookie cutter or the back of a sharp knife score fish. Bake pastries in oven until puffed and golden, 12 to 15 minutes.

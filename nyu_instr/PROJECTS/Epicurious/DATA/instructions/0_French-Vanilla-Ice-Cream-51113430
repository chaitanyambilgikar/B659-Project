1. Set up an ice bath by filling the sink or a large bowl with ice water. In a medium saucepan over moderately high heat, combine the cream, milk, 1 cup sugar, and the vanilla bean seeds and pod. Bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally to dissolve the sugar.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and the remaining 1 cup sugar. Gradually add the hot-cream mixture to the eggs, whisking constantly. Pour back into the saucepan and remove and discard the vanilla bean pod. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until the custard thickens just enough to coat the back of the spoon (it will be about 180°F).
3. Pour the custard through a fine-mesh sieve set over a large bowl then set the bowl in the ice bath and let cool, stirring occasionally. Refrigerate the cooled custard for at least 4 hours or overnight. Freeze in an ice cream machine according to the manufacturer's instructions. Pack the ice cream into containers, cover, and freeze for 3 to 4 hours before serving.

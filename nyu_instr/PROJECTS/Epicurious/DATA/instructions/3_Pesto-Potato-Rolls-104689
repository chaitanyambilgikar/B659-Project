Mix 3 1/2 cups water, potato and 1 teaspoon salt in saucepan. Cover; boil until potato is very tender, about 20 minutes. Mash potato with cooking water until smooth. Transfer 2 cups potato-water mixture to bowl (discard any remaining mixture); cool to 105°F to 115°F.
Whisk yeast, then pesto, sugar, pepper and remaining 1 teaspoon salt into potato mixture. Whisk in 1/2 cup melted butter, then eggs. Add enough flour, about 1/2 cup at a time, to form smooth and sticky dough, stirring vigorously with wood spoon. Butter large bowl. Transfer dough to bowl; turn to coat. Cover bowl with plastic wrap. For do-ahead version: Refrigerate dough overnight. For same-day version: Let dough rise in warm draft-free area until doubled in volume, about 45 minutes (do not punch down dough).
Butter two 9-inch-diameter cake pans with 1 1/2-inch-high sides. Roll out dough on floured surface to 1/3-inch-thick round. Using floured 2 1/2-inch round cutter, cut out rounds. Reroll dough scraps and cut out additional rounds. Dip top of each dough round briefly into 6 tablespoons melted butter. Fold each dough round into half-circle, buttered surfaces pressed gently together. Arrange half of folded dough rounds side by side, with flared sides turned up, in each prepared pan. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rise in warm draft-free area until dough rounds are almost doubled in volume, about 30 minutes for chilled dough and 20 minutes for room-temperature dough.
Meanwhile, position rack in center of oven; preheat to 400°F. Bake rolls until golden, about 25 minutes. Cool in pans at least 20 minutes. Turn out. Serve warm or at room temperature.

Heat heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle duck breast halves with salt and pepper. Add duck, skin side down, to skillet and cook to desired doneness, about 6 minutes per side for medium. Remove duck from heat and let stand 5 minutes. Meanwhile, place 1 cheese slice on each toasted bread piece. Whisk oil and vinegar in large bowl to blend. Season dressing with salt and pepper. Add greens; toss to coat. Divide greens among 4 plates. Place 2 cheese toasts in center of greens on each. Sprinkle walnuts on top. Thinly slice duck breasts crosswise; divide equally among salads, fanning slightly. Drizzle warm Port-Currant Sauce around salads and serve.

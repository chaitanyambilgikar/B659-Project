Combine butter, lemon juice, chopped mint, lemon peel, and garlic in small saucepan. Whisk over medium-low heat until butter melts and mixture is blended.
Prepare barbecue (medium heat). Brush flesh side of trout with some of lemon butter. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill trout, flesh side down, until beginning to brown, about 1 1/2 minutes. Using large metal spatula, turn trout over and grill until cooked through, brushing with more lemon butter, about 2 minutes longer. Transfer trout to plates, skin side down. Bring remaining lemon butter to boil and drizzle over trout. Sprinkle trout with sliced toasted almonds and serve.

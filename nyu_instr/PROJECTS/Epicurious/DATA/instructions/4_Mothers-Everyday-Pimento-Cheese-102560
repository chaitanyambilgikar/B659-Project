Finely grate cheeses into a large bowl. Stir in pimentos, black pepper, cayenne, and salt to taste with a fork. Then stir in mayonnaise, mashing mixture with fork until relatively smooth. (It should be flecked with small pieces of pimento.)
Scrape spread into a crock or jar and chill, covered, at least 2 hours to allow flavors to develop.
Serve pimento cheese with crackers or use as a filling for finger sandwiches.

Char poblanos directly over gas flame or in broiler until blackened on all sides. Enclose in plastic bag; let stand 10 minutes. Peel, seed, and chop poblanos.
Heat oil in large pot over medium heat. Add chorizo; sauté until cooked through, breaking up with back of fork, about 5 minutes. Add onions and garlic. Cover and cook 10 minutes. Mix in chili powder and cumin. Sprinkle turkey with salt and pepper. Add to pot and stir. Add broth and next 5 ingredients. Mix in roasted poblanos. Bring chili to boil, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer uncovered until turkey is tender, about 45 minutes. Season chili with more lime juice, if desired, and salt and pepper. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Chill uncovered until cold, then cover and keep chilled. Rewarm before serving.)

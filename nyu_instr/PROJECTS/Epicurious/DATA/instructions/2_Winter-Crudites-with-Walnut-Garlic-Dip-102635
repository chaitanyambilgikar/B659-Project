Cook potato in medium saucepan of boiling salted water until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain. Cool completely. Blend nuts, * cup oil, lemon juice, garlic and oregano in processor 1/3 until almost smooth. Add potato, 1/3 cup oil and 2 tablespoons water. Using on/off turns, process just until potato is blended and mixture is creamy (do not over-process or mixture will become sticky).
Transfer mixture to medium bowl. Mix in parsley. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.) Serve with vegetables.

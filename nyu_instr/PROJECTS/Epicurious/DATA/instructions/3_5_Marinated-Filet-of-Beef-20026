Trim the filet well. Combine soy sauce, garlic, ginger and sherry in a large bowl. Rub the filet thoroughly with the oil and place it in the bowl. Turn a number of times, and let it marinate for several hours, turning once or twice.
Place the filet on a rack, and roast in a 350°F. oven for 45-50 minutes, or until the meat thermometer registers 120°F. (for rare). Baste with the marinade several times during the roasting. Remove from the oven, and let it rest for several minutes before serving on a hot platter. Pour pan juices over the filet.
Garnish with broiled mushrooms and watercress and serve with wild rice and toasted almonds. Drink a Châteauneuf-du-Pape.

Preheat oven to 350° F.
Melt butter. With a 3-inch round cutter cut out 1 round from each bread slice. Brush both sides of rounds with butter and season with salt. On a baking sheet bake rounds in middle of oven until golden and crisp.
In a blender blend, eggs, cream, and salt until just combined and stir in 2 tablespoons chives. In a double boiler or a metal bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water cook the egg mixture, stirring, until creamy and just cooked through, about 4 minutes, and season with freshly ground black pepper.
Put 1 bread round onto each of 4 plates and divide egg mixture among rounds. Top egg with salmon and garnish plates with remaining tablespoon chives.

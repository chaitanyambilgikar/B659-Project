Melt butter in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add onions; cook until deep brown, stirring frequently, about 25 minutes. Add broth and wine; boil until soup is slightly reduced and flavors blend, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
Meanwhile, preheat oven to 500°F. Put 4 deep ovenproof bowls on baking sheet. Put 1/3 cup croutons in each bowl.
Ladle soup over croutons. Top with cheeses. Bake soup until heated through and cheeses melt, about 8 minutes.

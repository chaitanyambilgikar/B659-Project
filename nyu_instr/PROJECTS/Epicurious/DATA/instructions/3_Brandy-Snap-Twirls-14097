Preheat oven to 375° F. and butter a heavy baking sheet.
Into a small bowl sift together flour, ginger, and cloves. In a small saucepan melt butter with sugar, golden syrup, and water over moderate heat, stirring until smooth. Stir in flour mixture until combined well and let stand 2 minutes. Spoon 1 1/4 teaspoons batter onto baking sheet and spread into a 6-inch length. Make 2 or 3 more cookies in same manner, keeping them 2 inches apart. Bake cookies in middle of oven 7 to 10 minutes, or until golden brown, and cool on baking sheet on a rack 30 to 45 seconds, or until firm enough to hold their shape but still pliable.
Working quickly, wrap hot cookies, 1 at a time, in a spiral around handle of a wooden spoon. (If cookies become too crisp to remove from baking sheet, return baking sheet to oven 1 minute, or until cookies are heated through and pliable.) Cool cookies 20 seconds and slide off spoon handle. Make more cookies with remaining batter in same manner. Brandy snap twirls may be made 2 weeks ahead and kept in an airtight container at room temperature.

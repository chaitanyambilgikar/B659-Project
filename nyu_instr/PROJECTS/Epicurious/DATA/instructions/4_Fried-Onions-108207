Whisk together the eggs and milk in a medium bowl. Toss in the sliced onion and let stand for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
In a large bowl, season the flour with salt and pepper.
Pour an inch of oil into a deep skillet and heat it to 350 degrees. Lift the onions out of the egg mixture and toss them in the flour. Fry, in batches, until golden brown, and transfer to paper towels to drain.
Place the onions in a casserole, sprinkle with the cheese, and bake for 10 minutes. Serve.

Make flan: Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 325°F. Place 9-inch-diameter cake pan with 1 1/2-inch-high sides in oven. Bring lime juice to simmer in small saucepan. Remove from heat; cool.
Stir sugar and 1/4 cup water in heavy small saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat and boil without stirring until deep amber color, occasionally brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush and swirling pan, about 6 minutes. Pour hot caramel into hot cake pan; using oven mitts, tilt cake pan to coat bottom evenly. Set aside.
Stir reduced-fat milk and cornstarch in 1-cup glass measuring cup to blend. Combine condensed milk, lime peel and lime juice in large bowl. Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean. Stir to blend. Stir in egg substitute, then cornstarch mixture. Pour custard over caramel in pan. Place cake pan in large roasting pan. Add enough hot water to roasting pan to come halfway up sides of cake pan. Cover roasting pan with foil.
Bake custard until set around edges and center 4 inches still moves when pan is gently shaken, about 50 minutes (do not overbake or custard will curdle). Transfer cake pan to rack and let flan cool. Cover and refrigerate flan overnight.
Make pineapple: Spray large nonstick skillet with nonstick spray. Place skillet over high heat. Add 8 pineapple slices to skillet and cook until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Drizzle 1 tablespoon lime juice over pineapple. Using spatula, transfer pineapple to plate. Wipe out skillet, then spray with more nonstick spray. Repeat with remaining 8 pineapple slices and 1 tablespoon lime juice. Cut pineapple slices diagonally in half. Sprinkle with chopped mint.
Run small knife around cake pan sides to loosen flan. Invert flan onto platter. Cut into wedges; serve with pineapple.

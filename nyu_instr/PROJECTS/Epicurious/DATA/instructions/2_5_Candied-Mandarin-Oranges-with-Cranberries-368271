Using a sharp paring knife, slice tops and bottoms from oranges. Cut off peel and white pith. Set aside.
Bring sugar and 3 cups water to a boil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring to dissolve sugar. Add St-Germain and oranges. Remove from heat; cover and let stand overnight at room temperature.
Preheat broiler. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil. Using a slotted spoon, transfer oranges from saucepan to prepared sheet; reserve syrup. Broil until oranges are browned in spots, 3-4 minutes per side. Transfer to a platter; set aside.
Place cranberries in a small saucepan. Add enough syrup from oranges to cover, reserving the remaining syrup for another use. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium and simmer until berries are soft and begin to burst, 5-7 minutes. DO AHEAD: oranges and cranberries can be prepared 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.
Spoon cranberries with juices over caramelized mandarins. Serve warm or at room temperature.

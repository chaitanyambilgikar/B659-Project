Preheat oven to 350°F. Generously butter muffin cups.
Whisk together flours, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl, then stir in oats, cereals, and raisins. Whisk together butter, buttermilk, sugars, and eggs in another bowl, then add to cereal mixture and stir until just combined. (Batter will be very thick.)
Spoon 1/3 cup batter into each muffin cup and bake in middle of oven until golden and a tester comes out clean, 17 to 20 minutes. Remove muffins from pan and cool on a rack.

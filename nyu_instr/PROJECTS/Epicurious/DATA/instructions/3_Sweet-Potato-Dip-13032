Preheat oven to 400° F.
Prick potatoes with a fork and on a foil-lined baking sheet bake in middle of oven 1 1/2 hours, or until very soft. Cool potatoes slightly and scoop flesh into a bowl.
In a food processor purée potatoes with remaining ingredients, adding enough water to reach desired consistency.
Serve dip with chips or crudités.

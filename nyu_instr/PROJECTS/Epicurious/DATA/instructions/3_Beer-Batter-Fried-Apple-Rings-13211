In a bowl whisk together the flour, the beer, and the salt until the batter is smooth and let the batter stand, covered, at room temperature for 1 hour. In another bowl combine the lemon juice and 2 tablespoons of the brown sugar, on a baking sheet or a shallow tray arrange the apples, peeled, cored, and cut into 1/4-inch-thick rings, in one layer, and pour the lemon juice mixture over them. Let the apple rings stand, covered, at room temperature, turning them once, for 1 hour and pat them dry.
In a deep fryer or large heavy skillet heat 1 1/2 inches of the oil to 375°F., dip each apple ring in the batter, coating it well and letting the excess batter drip off, and in the oil fry the rings in batches, turning them once, for 4 minutes. Transfer the rings to paper towels, let them drain well, and sprinkle them with the additional brown sugar.

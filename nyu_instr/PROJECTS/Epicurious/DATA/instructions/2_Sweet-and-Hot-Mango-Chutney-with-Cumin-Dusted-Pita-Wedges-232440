In a medium saucepan, combine the first six ingredients with 3 tbsp water. Set over medium heat and simmer 15 minutes or until mango breaks down and mixture thickens. Use a potato masher to mash any large chunks, if desired.
For the pita wedges: Heat oven to 400°F. Coat a large baking sheet with cooking spray. Cut each pita into 8 wedges and place on baking sheet. Lightly coat wedges with cooking spray, sprinkle with cumin and season with salt and pepper. Bake 15 minutes or until golden brown.

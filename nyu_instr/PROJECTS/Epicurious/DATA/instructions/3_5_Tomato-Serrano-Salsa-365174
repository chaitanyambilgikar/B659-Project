Combine tomatoes and chiles in a medium bowl. Place minced onion in a strainer; rinse under cold water for 10 seconds. Drain well and add to bowl with tomatoes. Stir in cilantro and lime juice. Season with salt. Serve with tortilla chips. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill (salsa will get hotter the longer it sits).

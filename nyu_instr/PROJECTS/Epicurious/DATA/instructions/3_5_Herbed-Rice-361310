Place rice in medium bowl. Add enough cold water to cover and stir. Drain. Repeat until water drained from rice is clear, 3 or 4 more times. Bring 2 cups water to boil in heavy medium saucepan. Stir in rice and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cover; reduce heat to low and simmer until rice is tender and water is absorbed, 18 to 20 minutes. Mix in herbs and season with additional salt, if desired.

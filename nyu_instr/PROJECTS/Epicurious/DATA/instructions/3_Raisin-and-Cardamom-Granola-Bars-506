Preheat oven to 350°F. Line 9-inch square baking pan with foil, allowing foil to extend over sides. Butter foil. Mix oats, raisins, pecans and cardamom in bowl. Combine butter, sugar and honey in medium saucepan. Stir over medium heat until butter melts and mixture is smooth and begins to boil. Pour butter mixture over oat mixture and stir until well coated. Transfer to prepared pan. Using spatula, press mixture evenly into pan.
Bake oat mixture until top is golden brown, about 30 minutes. Transfer to rack and cool. Using foil as aid, lift out of pan; place on work surface. Using large sharp knife, cut into 18 bars.

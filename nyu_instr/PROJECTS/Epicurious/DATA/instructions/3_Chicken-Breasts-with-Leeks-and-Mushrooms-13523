In a shallow bowl stir together the flour, the paprika, and salt and pepper to taste and dredge the chicken breasts in the flour mixture, shaking off the excess. In a heavy (preferably cast-iron) skillet heat the oil over moderately high heat until it is hot but not smoking and in it sauté the chicken, turning it once, until it is golden brown. Reduce the heat to moderately low and stir in the leeks, the mushrooms, the wine, the broth, and the thyme. Cook the mixture, covered partially, for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through, and transfer the chicken to a platter. To the skillet add the olives, the capers, and the lemon juice and cook the mixture, stirring, for 1 minute. Serve the chicken topped with the leek mixture.

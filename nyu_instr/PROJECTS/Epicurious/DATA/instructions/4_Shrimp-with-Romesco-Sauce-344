Stir almonds in heavy small skillet over medium heat until golden, about 3 minutes. Transfer almonds to processor. Place bread in same skillet and cook until lightly toasted, about 1 minute per side. Tear bread into pieces and add to processor. With machine running, drop garlic through feed tube and process until almonds and garlic are finely chopped. Add red peppers, oil, vinegar and cayenne pepper and process until mixture is consistency of thick mayonnaise, scraping down sides of bowl occasionally. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
Arrange cooked shrimp on plates. Spoon romesco sauce over and serve.

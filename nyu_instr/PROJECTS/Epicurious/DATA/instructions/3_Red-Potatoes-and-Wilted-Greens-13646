In a medium saucepan bring potatoes with enough salted water to cover them by 1/2 inch to a boil and simmer 15 minutes, or until tender. Drain potatoes in a colander and when cool enough to handle cut each potato in half.
In a heavy skillet heat butter and oil over moderate heat until foam subsides and cook potatoes, cut sides down, until golden, about 5 minutes. Loosen potatoes from bottom of skillet with a metal spatula. Add garlic and cook, stirring, until garlic is pale golden. Add greens and cook, covered, 3 minutes, or until greens are wilted.
Season mixture with salt and pepper and stir until combined well.

Preheat oven to 250°F.
Whisk together egg white and water in a large bowl until frothy and stir in nuts. Stir together sugar and cinnamon and stir into nuts, coating well. Spread nuts in a lightly buttered large shallow pan and bake in middle of oven until dry, about 50 minutes. Cool and break into bite-size chunks.

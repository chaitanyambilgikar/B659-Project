Cook green beans in a 4-quart pot of well-salted boiling water, uncovered, until crisp-tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain.
Meanwhile, heat oil with red pepper flakes in a 12-inch heavy skillet (preferably straight-sided) over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Sauté Brussels sprouts with 1/2 teaspoon salt until crisp-tender, about 6 minutes.
Add beans and sauté 2 minutes. Add water and boil until evaporated and vegetables are just tender, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in mint. Season with salt.

Reserve about 3 tablespoons peanuts for sprinkling. In a saucepan stir remaining peanuts and Southern Comfort into butterscotch sauce and cook over moderately low heat, stirring, until heated through. Scoop ice cream into 4 sundae dishes and spoon sauce over it. Sprinkle sundaes with reserved peanuts.

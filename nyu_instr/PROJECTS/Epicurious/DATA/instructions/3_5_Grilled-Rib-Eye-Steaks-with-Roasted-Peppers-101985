Whisk 1/3 cup oil, thyme, savory and 2 teaspoons anchovies in 13x9x2-inch glass dish to blend. Add steaks; turn to coat. Let stand at room temperature 1 hour, or cover and refrigerate overnight.
Char all peppers over gas flame, in broiler or on barbecue until blackened on all sides. Enclose peppers in paper bag 10 minutes. Peel, seed and cut peppers into 1/2-inch-wide strips. Mix 1/3 cup oil, 2 teaspoons anchovies and garlic in large bowl to blend. Add peppers. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Bring peppers to room temperature before continuing.)
Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Remove steaks from marinade; pat dry. Sprinkle steaks with salt and pepper. Grill steaks to desired doneness, about 6 minutes per side for medium-rare. Transfer to cutting board. Let stand 5 minutes.
Cut steaks diagonally into thin slices. Divide meat among plates. Spoon peppers next to meat. Pour any juices from cutting board over peppers. Sprinkle with parsley and serve.

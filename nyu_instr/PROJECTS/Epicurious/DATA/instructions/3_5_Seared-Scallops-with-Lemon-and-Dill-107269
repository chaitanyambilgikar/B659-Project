Melt 1 tablespoon butter in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle scallops with salt and pepper. Add scallops to skillet; cook until golden and just opaque in center, about 1 minute per side. Transfer scallops to plate; tent with foil to keep warm.
Melt 1 tablespoon butter in same skillet. Add shallots; sauté 1 minute. Add wine; boil until reduced by half, about 1 minute. Stir in chopped dill, lemon juice, and peel. Remove pan from heat; add chilled butter cubes, a few pieces at a time, whisking just until melted (do not boil). Season with salt and pepper. Divide scallops between 2 plates. Pour sauce over scallops; garnish with dill sprigs.

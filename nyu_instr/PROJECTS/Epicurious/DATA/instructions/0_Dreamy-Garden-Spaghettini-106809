1. Preheat the oven to 250°F. Meanwhile, line a baking sheet with foil. Place the tomatoes, cut-side up, on the foil. Drizzle with the olive oil and sprinkle with the sugar and pepper. Roast in the oven for 1 1/2 hours. Remove from the oven and place the tomatoes and their juices in a large bowl.
2. Add the parsley, capers, lemon zest, and lemon juice to the tomatoes; toss gently.
3. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the spaghettini until just tender, drain and add it to the tomato mixture. Toss well.
4. Toss the snow peas with the hot pasta and tomatoes. Serve in shallow bowls, garnished with arugula.

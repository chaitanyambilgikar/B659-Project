Preheat oven to 350°F.
In blender, pulse basil, 1/4 cup olive oil, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper until smooth. Transfer to small bowl, add shrimp, and toss to combine. Refrigerate, covered, at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours.
Brush ciabatta slices on both sides with oil (about 1/4 cup total) and sprinkle with salt and pepper (about 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper total). Arrange in single layer on rimmed baking sheet and bake until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.
In heavy medium saucepan over moderately high heat, heat 1/4 cup oil until hot but not smoking. Add garlic and rosemary and sauté until golden, about 2 minutes. Add stock and beans and bring to boil, then reduce heat to moderate and simmer, uncovered, until liquid is reduced by 1/3, about 2 minutes. Transfer to blender and purée until smooth. With motor running, add 2 tablespoons oil and blend until incorporated. Blend in 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Set purée aside.
In small bowl, whisk together lemon juice, remaining 1/4 cup olive oil, remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper.
Transfer arugula to medium bowl, drizzle with olive oil–lemon juice mixture, and toss to combine.
Spread about 2 tablespoons white bean mixture on each bread slice, then top each with 1/2 cup arugula and 6 shrimp halves. Drizzle 1/4 teaspoon chile-garlic sauce over each slice and serve immediately.

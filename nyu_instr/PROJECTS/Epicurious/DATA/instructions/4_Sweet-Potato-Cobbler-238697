Make filling: Peel sweet potatoes, then halve lengthwise and slice crosswise 1/4 inch thick. Combine potatoes with remaining filling ingredients in a wide 4- to 5-quart pot and simmer, covered, until potatoes are almost tender, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer potatoes with a slotted spoon to a bowl and boil liquid, uncovered, until reduced to about 2 cups (it will become syrupy), 20 to 25 minutes.
Make dough and bake cobbler: Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 375°F. 3Whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Blend in butter with your fingertips or a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse meal. Stir in milk with a fork until a dough forms.
Gather dough into a ball, then turn out onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead 7 or 8 times. Divide dough into 2 pieces, then form each into a disk.
Roll out 1 disk with a floured rolling pin into a 14-inch round (about 1/8 inch thick) and fit into bottom and about halfway up side of Dutch oven, pressing against side to help it adhere.
Roll out remaining dough into another 14-inch round, then trim to a 12-inch round with a paring knife, reserving trimmings.
Spoon half of sweet potatoes evenly into dough-lined Dutch oven, then top with 1 layer dough trimmings, cutting and fitting trimmings to almost cover potatoes. Add remaining potatoes, then pour syrup over potatoes and cover with 12-inch dough round, pressing edges together to seal. Cut 3 steam vents in top with paring knife.
Bake cobbler until top is golden, 40 to 45 minutes. Cool to warm before serving, about 30 minutes (dough will absorb most of syrup).

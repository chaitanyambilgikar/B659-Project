Puree 3 tablespoons oil, cheese, basil, and 1/4 teaspoon chopped garlic in mini processor until smooth. Season pesto with salt and pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onion and sauté until soft, about 6 minutes. Add all remaining garlic; stir 30 seconds. Add artichokes and 2 1/2 cups broth. Bring to boil, reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until artichokes are soft, about 7 minutes. Working in batches, puree soup in blender until almost smooth. Strain into same saucepan, pressing on solids to release liquid. Thin with additional broth by 1/4 cupfuls if desired. Season soup with salt and pepper. Divide among bowls; drizzle with pesto.

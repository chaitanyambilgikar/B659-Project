Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms, onion, green pepper and garlic and sauté until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add Cajun seasoning and crushed red pepper and stir 1 minute. Mix in crushed tomatoes and stewed tomatoes with their juices; simmer until sauce is thick, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes. Add shrimp and simmer until just cooked through, about 5 minutes.

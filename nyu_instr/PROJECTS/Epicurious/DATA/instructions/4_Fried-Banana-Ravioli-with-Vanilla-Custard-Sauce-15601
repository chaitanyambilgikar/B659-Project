Gently mix bananas, brown sugar, graham cracker crumbs, walnuts and pecans in medium bowl (do not mash bananas). Lay wonton wrappers on work surface and brush edges with egg. Spoon 1 1/2 heaping teaspoons banana filling into center of each wrapper. Fold wrappers diagonally over filling. Press edges to seal. Place on baking sheet lined with plastic wrap. (Ravioli can be prepared 6 hours ahead. Cover with plastic and refrigerate.)
Add enough oil to heavy large skillet to reach depth of 2 inches. Heat over medium heat to 350°F. Working in batches, add ravioli; cook until golden brown, about 45 seconds per side. Using slotted spoon, transfer to paper towels; drain.
Arrange ravioli on serving plate and dust with powdered sugar, if desired. Serve with Vanilla Custard Sauce.

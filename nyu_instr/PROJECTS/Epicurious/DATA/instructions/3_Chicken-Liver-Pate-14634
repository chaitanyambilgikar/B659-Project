Hard-boil eggs and cool. Peel eggs and chill, covered, until ready to use. Trim chicken livers and pat dry between paper towels. Chop medium onions and garlic.
In a large heavy skillet cook chopped onions and garlic in oil over moderate heat, stirring, until golden, about 10 minutes. Increase heat to moderately high and add chicken livers. Cook mixture, stirring occasionally, until livers are cooked through but still barely pink inside, 5 to 8 minutes. Transfer mixture to a bowl and cool.
Finely chop enough of small onion to measure 1/3 cup and in a food processor pulse together with 2 hard-boiled eggs until well blended. Add liver mixture, Sherry or brandy, sugar, and salt and pepper to taste and blend until smooth. Transfer pâté to a small serving bowl and cool. Chill pâté, covered, at least 4 hours and up to 2 days.
Just before serving, separate yolk and white from remaining hard-boiled egg and force them separately through a coarse sieve onto pâté.
Serve pâté with toasts or crackers.

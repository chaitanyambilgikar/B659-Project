For vinaigrette: Whisk vinegar, shallots, and mustard in small bowl to blend. Gradually whisk in oil. Season vinaigrette with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Bring vinaigrette to room temperature and rewhisk before using.)
For salad: Spray grill rack with nonstick spray. Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Cut cornbread into 4 squares; remove from pan. Cut each square into four 1-inch-wide strips. Brush cornbread strips lightly on all sides with oil. Grill bread just until grill marks appear, about 1 minute per side. Transfer bread to work surface; cool. Brush onion rounds with oil. Grill until tender and golden, turning once, about 6 minutes per side. Transfer to large bowl; cool.
Cut bread into 1-inch cubes. Separate onion rounds into rings; return onions to same bowl. (Grilled cornbread and onions can be prepared 4 hours ahead; let stand at room temperature.)
Add tomatoes, arugula, basil, cucumber, and olives to bowl with onion rings. Add vinaigrette and toss to coat, then add cornbread and toss gently; serve.

Halve zucchini lengthwise and diagonally cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Finely chop garlic. Pat anchovies dry and coarsely chop.
In a large nonstick skillet heat oil and anchovies over moderate heat, stirring, until anchovies are dissolved, 1 to 2 minutes. Add zucchini and salt and pepper to taste and cook, stirring frequently, until zucchini is crisp-tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Add garlic, zest, and parsley and cook, stirring, 1 minute.

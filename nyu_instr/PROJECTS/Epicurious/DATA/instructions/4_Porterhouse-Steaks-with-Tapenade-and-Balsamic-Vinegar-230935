Preheat oven to 400°F. Mix tapenade and rosemary in small bowl to blend. Sprinkle steaks with salt and generously with cracked black pepper.
Divide olive oil between 2 heavy medium ovenproof skillets set over high heat. Add 1 steak to each skillet and cook until both are browned, about 3 minutes per side. Spread half of tapenade mixture atop each steak. Transfer skillets with steaks to oven. Cook both steaks until thermometer inserted into center of steaks registers 125°F for medium-rare, about 20 minutes. Transfer both steaks to platter. Pour 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar into each skillet and cook over medium heat until liquid is slightly reduced, scraping up browned bits, about 1 minute. Drizzle hot skillet juices over each steak and serve.
*Look for tapenade (an earthy, thick paste or spread made from brine-cured olives, olive oil, capers, anchovies, lemon juice, and seasonings) at some supermarkets, specialty foods stores, and Italian markets.

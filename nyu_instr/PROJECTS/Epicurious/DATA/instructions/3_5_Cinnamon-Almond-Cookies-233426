Sift first 4 ingredients into medium bowl. Beat butter in large bowl until fluffy. Beat in both sugars. Add egg and egg yolk; beat to blend. Beat in vanilla and salt. Add flour mixture and beat until dough comes together in moist clumps. Add almonds and knead gently in bowl with hands until blended.
Divide dough into 4 equal portions. Roll each into 10-inch-long log, about 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Wrap dough in 2 layers of plastic and place in freezer until frozen, at least 4 hours. (Can be prepared 1 month ahead. Keep frozen.)
Preheat oven to 350°F. Working with 1 log at a time, remove plastic and cut crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick rounds. Place rounds on ungreased baking sheet, spacing 1 inch apart.
Bake until light golden brown, about 12 minutes. Transfer cookies to rack and cool completely. (Can be prepared 4 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.)

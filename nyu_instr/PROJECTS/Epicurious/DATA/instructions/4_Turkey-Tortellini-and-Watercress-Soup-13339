In a large kettle combine the water, the turkey carcass, the carrot, the celery, the bay leaf, the onion, the thyme, the parsley, and the fennel seeds and simmer the mixture, uncovered, for 1 1/2 hours. Strain the stock through a large sieve into a large bowl, transfer the turkey meat to a cutting board, discarding the bones and remaining solids, and chop it fine. Transfer the strained stock to the kettle, add the turkey meat, and bring the liquid to a boil. Add the tortellini and salt and pepper to taste and simmer the mixture until the tortellini are just tender. Add the watercress and simmer the soup for 1 minute. Makes about 12 cups.

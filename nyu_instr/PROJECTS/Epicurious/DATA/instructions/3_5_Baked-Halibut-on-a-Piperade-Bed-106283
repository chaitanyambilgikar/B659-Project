1. Place 4 tablespoons of the oil and the butter in a heavy saucepan over low heat. Add the peppers and onion. Cook, stirring occasionally, until completely soft, about 30 minutes, seasoning with the thyme, salt, and pepper.
2. Add the garlic, 4 tablespoons of the parsley, and the basil. Cook for 5 minutes more. (You can add some white wine if liquid is needed.) Spoon into a 9x13x2-inch baking dish. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 400°F.
3. Combine the lemon juice, the remaining tablespoon of oil, salt, and pepper. Cut the fish in half crosswise and marinate in the lemon juice mixture for 15 minutes. Arrange the fish atop the peppers; drizzle with the marinade. Bake for 15 minutes. Serve immediately with lemon halves; sprinkle with the remaining parsley.

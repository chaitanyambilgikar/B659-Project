Heat olive oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Season chicken with salt and pepper. Sauté chicken in batches if necessary until brown, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer to plate.
Pour off all but 2 tablespoons drippings from skillet. Add garlic and aniseed and stir 30 seconds. Add tomatoes, broth Ouzo and oregano. Bring mixture to simmer, breaking up tomatoes with back of spoon. Return chicken to skillet. Bring to simmer and cook uncovered 15 minutes. Transfer chicken breasts to plate. Turn chicken pieces in skillet over and simmer 5 minutes longer. Transfer chicken in skillet to same plate.
Increase heat to high, add olives and cook until liquid is reduced to sauce consistency, stirring occasionally, about 6 to 8 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Reheat gently before continuing.) Sprinkle feta cheese over and serve.

Preheat oven to 350°F. Place all purpose flour in shallow bowl. Sprinkle both sides of veal shank pieces with salt and pepper. Dredge each veal piece in flour, shaking off excess. Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in heavy large ovenproof pot over medium-high heat. Add veal pieces to pot, arranging in single layer, and sautéuntil brown, about 6 minutes per side. Using tongs, transfer veal pieces to plate.
Add remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil to pot. Add onion, carrot, celery, thyme sprigs, rosemary sprig and bay leaf and sautéuntil vegetables brown, about 12 minutes. Season vegetables to taste with salt and pepper. Place veal atop cooked vegetables in pot and pour chicken stock over. Bring to simmer; cover and place in oven. Cook until veal is very tender, about 1 hour 10 minutes. Discard bay leaf. Transfer 1 veal piece to each of 6 plates. Spoon excess fat off sauce, if desired. Spoon sauce and vegetables over veal and serve immediately.

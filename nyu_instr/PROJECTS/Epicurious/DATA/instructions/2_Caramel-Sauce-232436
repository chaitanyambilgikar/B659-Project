Combine the sugar and the 3/4 cup water in a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 12 to 15 minutes. Stir continuously with a spoon or wire whisk. Have the 1 cup boiling water ready on a back burner. When the caramel sauce begins to bubble and turn very dark brown, move the pan to a cool burner. Stirring continuously, drizzle in only enough boiling water to slightly thin out the syrup 1 to 2 tablespoons. (This will ensure that the sauce doesn't become too thick later.) Let the sauce cool before transferring to a jar with a tight-fitting lid.

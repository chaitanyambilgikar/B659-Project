Make corn bread rounds: Put oven rack in middle position and preheat to 350°F.
Whisk together cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Whisk together butter, milk, and egg in a small bowl, then add to cornmeal mixture and stir just until combined. Spread (or pat out) batter in a very thin even layer in a well-greased 13- by 9- by 2-inch metal baking pan (preferably using an offset spatula).
Bake until firm and pale golden, 20 to 25 minutes. Cut out 24 rounds from hot corn bread with cookie cutter and transfer rounds to a rack to cool. (Reserve remaining corn bread for another use.)
Top rounds: Spread each round with a thin layer of mustard and top with a few strips of ham and about 1 teaspoon chutney.

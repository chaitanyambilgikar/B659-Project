Using a fork, poke holes in eggplant and rub with 1/2 tsp oil. Season with salt and pepper. Roast in oven at 350°F until eggplant collapses (40 minutes to an hour). Remove and cool; scrape out insides and discard skin. Heat 1 tbsp oil in a 10" sauté pan on low heat. Add onion, red pepper, shallots, and garlic; cover and sauté until tender. Add eggplant, season with salt and pepper and cook, uncovered, 45 minutes, stirring occasionally, until all liquid evaporates. Transfer to a bowl and cool. Add chives and parsley.
Slice tofu lengthwise so each block is an inch thick. Cut the blocks into six 2-inch squares. Spread a 12-inch-wide piece of plastic wrap on the counter. Place 1 slice tofu on the plastic wrap. Season with salt and pepper and spread about 1/4 eggplant mixture across the top. Add another layer of tofu, season it and repeat until you have 2 layers of eggplant and 3 layers of tofu. Cover stack with plastic wrap. Repeat to make second stack. Place both stacks on a plate, chill 2 hours, remove and unwrap. Place flour in a medium-sized bowl. Beat eggs in another medium-sized bowl. Dip each stack in flour, then egg, then flour again, coating all sides each time. Heat remaining 2 tsp oil (or more if necessary) in a pan on medium-high heat. Sauté stacks on all sides (2 or 3 minutes per side) until golden brown. Serve immediately.

In a blender, combine lime pickle, lemon juice, and oil and puree until smooth, adding water as necessary to create a liquid. Set aside. Bring a medium pot of water to a boil and add 1 tbsp salt. Prepare an ice bath (a large bowl of ice water with 1 tbsp salt). Add chard to the pot and boil until bright green and very tender (9 to 12 minutes). Drain chard in a colander, submerge briefly in the ice bath to stop cooking, drain again in colander and squeeze to release most of the water. Set aside. Heat butter in a large sauté pan on medium heat. When butter is melted, add shallot, sprinkle with a pinch of salt and pepper, cover, reduce heat to low and sauté until shallot is translucent, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat. Add chard, lime-pickle puree, lemon zest, and salt and pepper to taste. Mix vigorously. Serve warm.

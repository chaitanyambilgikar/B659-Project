Preheat oven to 450°F.
Transfer jalapeños to large baking sheet and roast, turning occasionally, until softened and blistered, about 20 minutes. Using tongs, transfer to large bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let stand 10 minutes. Wearing gloves, peel and seed jalapeños, then cut into large dice.
In large bowl, whisk together flour, cornmeal, baking soda, and 3/4 teaspoon salt. In medium bowl whisk together buttermilk and egg. Whisk in dry ingredients, then fold in diced jalapeños and cream cheese.
In heavy, 4-quart pot over moderate heat, heat 3 inches of oil until thermometer registers 350°F. Working in batches of 6 and returning oil to 350°F between batches, drop batter by tablespoons into hot oil and fry fritters, stirring constantly, until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to paper towels to drain and immediately sprinkle with salt.
Serve immediately with salsa and sour cream.

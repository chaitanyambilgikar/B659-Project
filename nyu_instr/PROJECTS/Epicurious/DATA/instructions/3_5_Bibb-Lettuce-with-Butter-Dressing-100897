Separate lettuce leaves and put in a large bowl. Halve garlic and in a small heavy skillet heat with butter over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until garlic is golden and butter has a slight nutty aroma, about 3 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and discard garlic. Add lemon juice and salt and pepper to taste, swirling skillet to incorporate (butter will foam).
Pour warm dressing over lettuce and toss to coat. Serve salad immediately.

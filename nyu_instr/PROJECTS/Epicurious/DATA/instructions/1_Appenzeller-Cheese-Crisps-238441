Bring milk just to a boil over moderate heat in a 3-quart heavy saucepan and remove from heat. Whisk in cheeses until melted, then cool to room temperature, about 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, whisk together flour, baking powder, salt, and pepper in a large bowl.
Stir eggs and beer into cheese mixture, then stir into flour mixture until combined. Force batter through a medium-mesh sieve into a 2-quart measure or bowl and let stand, uncovered, 30 minutes.
Transfer batter to squeeze bottle.
Heat oil in a deep 10-inch heavy skillet (preferably cast-iron) until thermometer registers 320°F. Working very quickly, squeeze batter into hot oil in loose swirls to form 4 (2 1/2-inch) lacy rounds, then fry, turning over once, until golden, about 1 minute total. (Rounds will expand to about 3 inches as they cook.) Transfer with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain in 1 layer. Make more crisps in same manner. Serve warm or at room temperature.

In a bowl whisk together the flour, the baking powder, and the salt, add 1 1/4 cups of the cream, and stir the mixture until it just forms a dough. Gather the dough into a ball, knead it gently 6 times on a lightly floured surface, and roll or pat it out 1/2 inch thick. Cut out as many biscuits as possible with a 2-inch round cutter dipped in flour and transfer them to an ungreased baking sheet. Gather the scraps, reroll the dough, and cut out more biscuits in the same manner. Brush the tops of the biscuits with the additional cream, prick them lightly with a fork, and bake the biscuits in the middle of a preheated 425°F. oven for 15 minutes, or until they are pale golden. Transfer the biscuits to a rack and let them cool. The biscuits may be made 1 day in advance and kept in an airtight container.
Halve the biscuits horizontally with a fork, spread each half with some of the butter, and sprinkle it with about 1/4 teaspoon of the brown sugar, or to taste. On a baking sheet broil the halves under a preheated broiler about 2 inches from the heat for 45 seconds to 1 1/2 minutes, or until the sugar is melted and bubbling. Sandwich the ham between the biscuit halves.

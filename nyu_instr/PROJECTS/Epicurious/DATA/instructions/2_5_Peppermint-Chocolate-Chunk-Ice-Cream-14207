Make chocolate chunks: Line a baking sheet with wax paper.
Chop chocolate. In a double boiler or a metal bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water melt chocolate, stirring until smooth. Remove top of double boiler or bowl from heat and cool chocolate. Chop mints (largest pieces should be about 1/4 inch) and stir into chocolate. Spread chocolate mixture 1/4 inch thick on wax-paper-lined baking sheet. Chill chocolate mixture until firm, about 30 minutes. Coarsely chop chocolate mixture and chill, wrapped in plastic wrap. Chocolate chunks may be made 1 week ahead and chilled.
In a heavy saucepan whisk together cream, milk, cornstarch, and salt until smooth and add mints. Bring mixture to a boil over moderate heat, stirring constantly, and simmer, stirring constantly, 1 minute, or until mints are dissolved and mixture is thickened. Pour mixture through a sieve into a bowl and cool. Stir in extract and, if using clear mints, food coloring. Chill mixture, its surface covered with plastic wrap, at least 3 hours, or until cold, and up to 1 day.
Freeze mixture in an ice-cream maker. Transfer ice cream to a bowl and fold in chilled chocolate chunks. Transfer ice cream to an airtight container and put in freezer to harden. Ice cream may be made 1 week ahead.

Mix first 4 ingredients and 1/2 cup brown sugar in small bowl. Rub spice mixture over pork. Place in large glass baking dish. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
Preheat oven to 375°F. Transfer pork to large roasting pan. Reserve juices in glass dish. Roast pork until thermometer inserted into center registers 155°F., about 1 hour 45 minutes, basting with reserved juices from glass dish every 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine Port, shallots and remaining 1 tablespoon brown sugar in heavy medium saucepan. Boil until syrupy, about 25 minutes. Add both stocks and thyme. Boil until reduced to 1 1/4 cups, about 30 minutes. Strain sauce. Return to saucepan. Mix any pan drippings from pork into sauce (do not scrape roasting pan). Add butter; whisk until melted. Season with salt and pepper.
Cut pork into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Divide among 6 plates. Spoon Chipotle-glazed Apples alongside, dividing equally. Spoon sauce over and around pork.

Heat oil in a large heavy saucepan over medium-high heat. Add turmeric, onion, and garlic; sauté, stirring often, until onion is tender and golden, about 5 minutes. Stir in stock; bring to a boil. Add couscous and stir to blend. Remove saucepan from heat; cover and let stand 10 minutes. Stir in peas, chives, and lemon zest and juice. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Transfer couscous to a serving bowl, garnish with almonds, and serve.

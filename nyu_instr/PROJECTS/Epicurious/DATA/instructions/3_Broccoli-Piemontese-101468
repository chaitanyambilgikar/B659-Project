Cook broccoli in boiling, salted water until barely tender. Drain. Sauté garlic in enough oil to cover the bottom of a large skillet. When lightly browned, add broccoli and spoon hot oil and garlic over it. Season to taste. Add wine and cook down quickly. Serve the broccoli with pan juices poured over it.

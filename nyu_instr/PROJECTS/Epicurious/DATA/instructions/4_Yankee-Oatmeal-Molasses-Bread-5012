Place 1/2 cup oats in large bowl of electric mixer fitted with dough hook; pour 3/4 cup boiling water over. Let stand 30 minutes (water will be absorbed and oatmeal will be very soft).
Pour 1 cup warm water into 2-cup glass measuring cup. Sprinkle yeast over; stir to blend. Let stand until yeast dissolves, about 10 minutes. Mix molasses, 2 tablespoons butter and salt into oat mixture in bowl. Mix in yeast mixture. Add enough flour, 1 cup at a time, to form medium-soft dough, mixing at medium speed until well blended, about 3 minutes. Turn out dough onto floured surface. Knead until smooth and elastic, adding more flour if dough is too sticky, about 5 minutes. Form dough into ball. Butter large bowl; add dough, turning to coat. Cover bowl with plastic wrap, then towel. Let dough rise in warm draft-free area until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 400°F. Butter 9x5-inch loaf pan. Punch down dough; turn out into floured surface and knead 3 minutes. Form into 8-inch-long loaf. Transfer to prepared pan. Cover with plastic, then towel; let rise in warm draft-free area until dough has risen about 1/2 inch above rim of pan, about 45 minutes.

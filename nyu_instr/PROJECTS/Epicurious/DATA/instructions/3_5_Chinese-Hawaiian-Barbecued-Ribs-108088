Stir together sugar, soy sauce, ketchup, Sherry, and salt in a bowl until sugar is dissolved. Pour marinade into a roasting pan, then add garlic, ginger, and ribs, turning ribs to coat with marinade. Marinate, covered and chilled, turning occasionally, at least 3 hours.
Preheat oven to 325°F.
Line bottom of a broiler pan with foil, then arrange ribs, rounded sides up, on broiler rack, reserving marinade for basting (discard garlic and ginger). Roast in middle of oven, basting with marinade every 20 minutes (do not baste during last 10 minutes of cooking), until ribs are tender and glaze is well browned, about 1 3/4 hours. Discard any unused marinade.
Let racks stand 5 minutes, then cut into individual ribs.

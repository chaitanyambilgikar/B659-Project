In a large kettle cook the onions in 3 tablespoons of the butter over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until they are golden. Add the garlic, the Brussels sprouts, the water, the scallion, the bell peppers, and salt and pepper to taste and cook the mixture, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes, or until the vegetables are crisp-tender.
While the vegetables are cooking, in another large kettle cook the fettuccine in boiling salted water for 10 to 12 minutes, or until it is al dente, and drain it well. Stir the pasta into the vegetables and keep the mixture warm. In a small skillet cook the remaining 5 tablespoons butter over moderate heat, swirling the skillet, until it is browned, add it to the pasta mixture with the Parmesan and salt and pepper to taste, and toss the mixture well.

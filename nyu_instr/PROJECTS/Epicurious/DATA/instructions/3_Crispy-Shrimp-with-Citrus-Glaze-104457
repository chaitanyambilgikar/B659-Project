For glaze: Bring all ingredients to boil in medium saucepan. Boil until slightly syrupy and reduced to 1 cup, about 12 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Rewarm over medium heat before using.)
For shrimp: Place large rack on baking sheet. Whisk first 6 ingredients in medium bowl until well blended. Add shrimp; toss. Spread sesame seeds in pie dish. Dip shrimp into seeds, coating both sides. Place coated shrimp on rack.
Heat oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add half of shrimp; sauté until golden outside and opaque in center, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to plate. Repeat with remaining shrimp.
Divide lettuce among 10 plates. Top with shrimp. Drizzle glaze over shrimp. Garnish with mint.

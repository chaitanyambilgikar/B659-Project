One: Wash the chicken and pat dry. Put them in a large non-reactive glass or stainless steel bowl. In a separate bowl, combine the olive oil, lemon juice, wine, garlic, onion, bay leaf, oregano, juniper berries, coriander seeds, and a few liberal grindings of pepper. Whisk until well-mixed and pour over the chicken, fuming the chicken until it is uniformly coated with the marinade. Cover and refrigerate, marinating for 2 hours or overnight.
Two: Drain the chicken, pat dry, and sprinkle liberally with salt. Spread the flour on a plate or place it in a paper or large Zip-lock plastic bag. Fill a large cast-iron skillet with enough olive or peanut oil (or combination of both) to come halfway up the sides, about 1 inch deep. Over medium-high heat, bring the oil to 375°F (hot but not smoking).
Three: Beginning with the dark meat roll the chicken in the flour or drop it a few pieces at a time into the bag of flour, close the top, and shake until it is coated. Shake off the excess flour and slip the chicken into the hot fat
Four: Fry until the bottom is sealed and beginning to color, about 4 minutes. Turn, and brown the second side. Reduce the heat to medium (325°F) and fry, turning once, until the chicken is cooked through and golden, about 15 minutes more.
Lift the chicken from the fat and drain well on a wire rack. Transfer to a platter and garnish with the sprigs of herb and lemon wedges and serve at once.

Heat olive oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions, garlic, rosemary, and oregano. Sauté until onions are tender, about 5 minutes. Add diced tomatoes with juices, artichokes, sun-dried tomatoes, and olives. Simmer until sauce thickens slightly, about 3 minutes. Season sauce to taste with pepper.
Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite. Drain pasta, reserving 1 cup cooking liquid. Return pasta to same pot. Add sauce; toss over medium heat until sauce coats pasta, adding reserved cooking liquid by 1/4 cupfuls to moisten if pasta is dry. Mix in 3/4 cup cheese and 1/2 cup basil. Transfer pasta to bowl. Sprinkle with remaining cheese and 1/4 cup basil.

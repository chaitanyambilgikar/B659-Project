In a medium bowl, combine the garlic, diced onion, tomato, green bell pepper, and oregano. Add the salt and pepper, and mix well. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside.
In a large bowl, combine the ground beef, egg, salt, and pepper. Shape into eight 4-inch round, flat patties. Place a spoonful of the vegetable filling in the center of one patty, top with a second patty, press down firmly, and shape into a round, carefully sealing the sides by pinching together. Repeat with the remaining patties.
In a large nonstick skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat and sauté the sliced onions until lightly brown. Transfer to a bowl and keep warm. Transfer to a bowl and keep warm. Brown the hamburgers for about 5 minutes on each side, or until cooked to medium; return the onions to the pan and heat. Serve immediately.

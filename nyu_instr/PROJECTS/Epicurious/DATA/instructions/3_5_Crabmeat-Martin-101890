Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
Gently toss the crabmeat with the mustard and green onions in a bowl, being careful not to break up the crabmeat. Divide the mixture between 4 ramekins. Using an electric mixer, whip together the topping ingredients in a mixing bowl and spread the topping on the crabmeat mixture. Bake in the oven until thoroughly heated and the sauce is golden brown and bubbly, about 8 minutes. Serve hot.

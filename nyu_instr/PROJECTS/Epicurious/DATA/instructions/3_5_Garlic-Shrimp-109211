Wipe chiles clean and discard stems, seeds, and ribs. Cut into 1/3-inch squares with kitchen shears.
Heat chiles in oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until oil is hot but not smoking, then sauté chiles, stirring, just until they turn a shade darker, about 1 minute. (Do not let mixture smoke or chiles blacken.) Add onion and garlic and sauté, stirring, until beginning to brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Add tomatoes and 1/4 teaspoon salt and sauté, stirring, 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand at least 30 minutes to soften chiles.
Toss shrimp with remaining teaspoon salt in a large bowl.
Bring tomato mixture to a simmer over moderately high heat, then add shrimp and cook, stirring, until shrimp are just cooked through, about 5 minutes. Serve immediately.

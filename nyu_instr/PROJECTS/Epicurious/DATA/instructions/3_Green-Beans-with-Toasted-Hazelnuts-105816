Place hazelnuts in small nonstick skillet. Stir over medium heat until lightly toasted, about 8 minutes. Sprinkle with salt and set aside.

Melt butter in same pot over medium-high heat. Add beans and vinegar; toss to coat and heat through, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to serving bowl. Sprinkle with hazelnuts.

Simmer potatoes in enough salted water to cover by 1 inch until just tender, about 15 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold water until cool enough to handle. Pat dry and cut in half (quarter larger potatoes).
Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then sauté potatoes with salt to taste, turning occasionally, until golden brown, about 10 minutes.
While potatoes are sautâ€©ing, cook garlic in remaining tablespoon oil in a 5- to 6-quart pot over moderately high heat, stirring, until fragrant.
Stir in mussels and 1/4 cup water and cook, covered, until mussels are opened, 3 to 5 minutes. (Discard any unopened ones.)
Add spinach to potatoes, tossing until just wilted. Serve potatoes and spinach with mussels.

In a steamer set over boiling water steam the potatoes, covered, for 10 to 12 minutes, or until they are just tender. While the potatoes are steaming, in a bowl stir together the mint, the parsley, the butter, the sour cream, and salt and pepper to taste. Add the potatoes to the herb mixture and toss them well.

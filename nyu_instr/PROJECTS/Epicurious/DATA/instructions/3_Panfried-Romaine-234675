Rinse romaine halves, then shake off water and pat dry.
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat until hot but not smoking, then add 3 romaine halves, cut sides down, and sprinkle with a rounded 1/4 teaspoon sea salt.
Cook, turning over once with tongs, until browned, about 2 minutes total, then cover and cook until just crisp-tender, 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer to a platter.
Cook remaining romaine halves in oil in 3 batches in same manner, transferring to platter. Cool to room temperature before serving.

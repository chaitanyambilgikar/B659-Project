Finely chop 1/2 cup pecans.
In a food processor grind remaining 2 cups pecans with a pinch salt, occasionally scraping down side of bowl, until pecans release their oil and mixture becomes a smooth paste, about 3 minutes. Transfer pecan butter to a bowl and stir in remaining ingredients until combined well.
Form level teaspoons of pecan butter into balls and roll, no more than 2 at a time, in chopped pecans, pressing pecans gently to make adhere. Chill truffles, in layers separated by wax paper, in an airtight container at least 1 hour, or until firm, and up to 4 days.

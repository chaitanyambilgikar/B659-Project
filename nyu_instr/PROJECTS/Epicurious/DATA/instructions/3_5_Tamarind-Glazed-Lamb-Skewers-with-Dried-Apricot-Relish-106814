For glaze: Bring first 4 ingredients to boil in small saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat and simmer until reduced to 1 cup, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in lime juice.
For apricot relish: Mix apricots and next 5 ingredients in medium bowl to blend. Season relish to taste with salt and pepper. (Glaze and relish can be made 1 day ahead; cover separately and chill. Bring relish to room temperature. Stir glaze over medium heat until heated through.)
Thread lamb and onion pieces onto skewers, using about 6 onion and lamb pieces per skewer. (Skewers can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.)
Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Sprinkle skewers with salt and pepper. Grill lamb to desired doneness, turning once and basting with glaze during last minute of grilling, about 2 minutes total for medium-rare. Transfer skewers to platter. Serve with relish.

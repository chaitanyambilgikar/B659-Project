Place chopped parsley in small metal bowl. Whisk in 1/2 cup olive oil, lemon juice, garlic and crushed red pepper. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Refrigerate at least 4 hours. (Can be made 1 day ahead.) Bring to room temperature before using.
Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle both sides of steaks with salt and pepper. Add steaks to skillet and cook until desired doneness, about 3 minutes per side for medium-rare. Slice steaks crosswise and arrange on platter. Spoon chimichurri sauce over and serve.

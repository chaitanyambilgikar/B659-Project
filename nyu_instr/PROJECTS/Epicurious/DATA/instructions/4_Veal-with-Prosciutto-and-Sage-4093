Melt 1 tablespoon butter in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat. Add chopped shallots, sage, thyme and bay leaf and sautée 2 minutes. Add dry white wine and both stocks and boil until mixture is reduced to a cup, about 20 minutes. Add whipping cream and boil until reduced to sauce consistency, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. (Sauce can be prepared 4 hours ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
Pound each veal chop between sheets of waxed paper to 1/2-inch thickness. Sprinkle veal with salt and pepper. Dredge veal in flour; shake off excess. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in heavy large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Working in batches, add veal to skillet and sauté until cooked through, about 3 minutes per side.
Wrap 1 prosciutto slice around center of each piece of veal. Arrange 2 veal pieces on each plate. Strain sauce, if desired. Bring sauce to simmer. Pour around veal and serve immediately.

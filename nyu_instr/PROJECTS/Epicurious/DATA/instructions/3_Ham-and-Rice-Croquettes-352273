Stir together rice, ham, cheese, 1 egg, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Put remaining egg (lightly beaten) and bread crumbs in separate shallow bowls.
Heat 1 to 1 1/2 inches oil to 350°F in a 10-inch skillet over high heat. Meanwhile, dampen your hands and form 1/4-cup amounts of rice mixture into 2 1/2-inch cakes. Lightly coat with egg, then with bread crumbs. Fry croquettes in 2 batches, turning once or twice, until golden-brown, 2 to 3 minutes per batch.

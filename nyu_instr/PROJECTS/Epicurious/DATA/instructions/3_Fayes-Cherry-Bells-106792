1. Sift flour, baking soda, salt, ginger, and coffee; set aside. Cream the butter with an electric mixer. Add brown sugar; mix well. Blend in the Karo syrup, egg, and cream. Add dry ingredients and mix to make dough; chill well. Meanwhile, prepare filling: Combine nuts, brown sugar, and cherry juice; set aside.
2. Roll out 1/3 of the dough on a lightly floured surface to 1/8-inch thickness; cut into 2 1/2-inch rounds and place on an ungreased baking sheet. Place 1/2 teaspoon of filling in the center of each cookie, then shape into a bell by folding the sides over the filling, making the tops narrower than the bottoms. Place a cherry at the wide end for the clapper. Bake in a preheated 350°F oven for 12 to 15 minutes. Cool for 1 minute on a baking sheet, then transfer to a rack to cool.

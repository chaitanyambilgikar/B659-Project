1. Sift together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into a bowl.
2. Whisk together buttermilk, egg, butter, extracts, and food coloring (if using) in a small bowl. Add to dry ingredients and stir until incorporated. Stir in chocolate chips.
3. Heat a large nonstick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Add 1/2 tablespoon butter; it should sizzle and melt almost immediately. Ladle 1/4 cup of pancake batter into skillet for each pancake, taking care not to let the pancakes run together. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes, until bottom is golden brown and edges begin to bubble, then carefully flip and cook for 1 to 2 minutes more. Transfer to plates. Repeat with remaining batter.
4. Serve warm with whipped cream, vanilla ice cream, hot fudge sauce, and more chocolate chips, if desired.

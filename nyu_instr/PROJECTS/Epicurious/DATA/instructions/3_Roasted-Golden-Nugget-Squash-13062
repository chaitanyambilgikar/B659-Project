Preheat oven to 400°F.
Cut each squash into 6 wedges and scoop out and discard seeds and strings. In a large shallow baking pan drizzle squash with oil, rubbing to coat flesh. Season squash with salt and pepper and arrange, cut edges down, in pan.
Bake squash, turning it over halfway through baking, until tender, about 40 minutes.

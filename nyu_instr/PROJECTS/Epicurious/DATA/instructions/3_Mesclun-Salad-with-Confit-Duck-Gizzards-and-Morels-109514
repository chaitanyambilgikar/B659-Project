Make vinaigrette: Whisk together shallot, vinegar, mustard, salt, and pepper to taste in a small bowl. Add oil in a slow stream, whisking until combined. Let dressing stand 15 minutes (for flavors to develop).
Make salad: Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over high heat until just smoking, then sauté gizzards, stirring, until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and season with salt and pepper. Whisk dressing, then pour half over gizzards, tossing to coat.
Heat remaining tablespoon oil in skillet over high heat until hot but not smoking, then sauté morels, stirring, until lightly browned and tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and add to gizzards, tossing to combine.
Whisk remaining dressing, then pour over mesclun in a large bowl, tossing to coat.
Divide mesclun among 6 plates and top with gizzards and morels.

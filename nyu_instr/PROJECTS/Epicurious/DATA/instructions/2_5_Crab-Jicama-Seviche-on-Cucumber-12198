Peel jícama and cut in half. Finely chop half of jícama, or enough to measure 1/2 cup, and shred remaining half, or enough to measure 1/3 cup. Reserve any remaining for another use.
In a small bowl stir together jícama, crab, 1 1/2 tablespoons lime juice, scallion, chili, tomato, and 1/4 teaspoon garlic. Season "seviche" with salt and pepper.
Halve avocado, reserving half for another use. In small bowl with a fork mash remaining avocado, remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons lime juice, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon garlic with salt to taste until smooth. Seviche and avocado mixtures may be made 4 hours ahead and chilled separately, their surfaces covered with plastic wrap.
Cut cucumber crosswise diagonally into twenty-four 1/4-inch-thick slices. Top each cucumber slice with 1/2 teaspoon avocado mixture and 1 teaspoon seviche mixture.

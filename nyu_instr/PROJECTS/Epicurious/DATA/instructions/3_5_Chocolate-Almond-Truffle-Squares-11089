Chop fine 12 ounces of the chocolate. In a small saucepan bring the cream just to a boil, remove the pan from the heat, and whisk in the chopped chocolate, whisking until the chocolate is melted completely. Whisk in the Amaretto, whisking until the mixture is smooth, and let the truffle mixture cool slightly.
In a small heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water melt the remaining 4 ounces chocolate. Line the bottom of an 8-inch-square baking pan with wax paper and spread half of the melted chocolate in a thin layer on the paper.
Freeze the chocolate layer for 5 minutes and top it with the truffle mixture, smoothing the surface. Drizzle the truffle mixture with the remaining melted chocolate, spreading it lightly, and sprinkle the melted chocolate with the almonds, pressing them lightly. Chill the mixture for 3 hours, or until it is firm. Turn the mixture out onto a cutting board, peel off the wax paper, and with a long sharp knife cut the mixture into 3/4-inch squares. The truffle squares keep, chilled in an airtight container, for 2 weeks.

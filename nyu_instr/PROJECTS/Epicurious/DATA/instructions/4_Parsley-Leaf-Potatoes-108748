Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 450°F.
Pour butter into a large shallow baking pan (1 inch deep) and tilt to coat bottom. Working with 1 potato at a time, halve potatoes lengthwise, then put a parsley leaf on cut side of each potato half and season with salt. Put potatoes, cut sides down, in baking pan and roast (do not turn over) until undersides are golden and potatoes are tender, 45 minutes.

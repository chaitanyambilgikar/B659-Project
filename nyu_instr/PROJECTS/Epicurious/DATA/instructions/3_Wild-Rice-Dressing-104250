Preheat oven to 325°F.
Prepare rice: Rinse rice in a sieve under cold water, then cover with cold water by 2 inches in a 4-quart pot. Simmer, covered, until tender, 50 minutes to 1 hour. Drain rice in sieve and cool 10 minutes.
Prepare other ingredients while rice simmers: Toast bread in a large shallow baking pan in middle of oven until dry, about 30 minutes.
Cook bacon in a large skillet over moderate heat, stirring, until crisp and transfer with a slotted spoon to a large bowl. Cook onions in fat remaining in skillet, stirring, until softened. Add celery and cook, stirring, 1 minute.
Assemble and bake dressing: Add onions and celery to bacon and stir in parsley, bread, rice, and salt and pepper to taste.
Increase temperature to 375°F.
Transfer dressing to a buttered 3- to 4-quart baking dish and drizzle chicken broth over dressing. Bake dressing, covered, 20 minutes, then uncover and bake 20 minutes more, or until bread is golden brown and dressing is heated through.

Mix first 4 ingredients in small bowl to blend; season to taste with salt and pepper.
Combine 1/3 cup water, wine, shallot, parsley, and thyme in large skillet. Place salmon fillets, skin side down, in skillet; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cover skillet tightly and simmer over medium-low heat until salmon is barely opaque in center, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat; let stand, covered, 5 minutes. Transfer salmon to platter; discard wine mixture. Cover salmon with plastic wrap and chill until cold, at least 4 hours. (Watercress mayonnaise and salmon can be made 1 day ahead. Cover separately and keep chilled.)
Place 1 salmon fillet on each of 6 plates. Serve with watercress mayonnaise.

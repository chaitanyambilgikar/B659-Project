Cover raisins with warm water and let soak 15 minutes, then drain.
Bring broth and 3 cups water to a bare simmer in a small saucepan and keep at a bare simmer.
Cook onion with 1/4 teaspoon salt in oil in a 5-quart heavy pot over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 7 minutes.
Stir in raisins, radicchio, and rice. Cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add wine and simmer briskly, stirring constantly, until absorbed, 1 to 2 minutes.
Stir in 1/2 cup of simmering broth and cook, stirring constantly and keeping at a strong simmer, until absorbed.
Continue cooking and adding broth, about 1/2 cup at a time, stirring frequently and letting each addition be absorbed before adding the next, until rice is al dente and creamy, 18 to 20 minutes. Thin with some of remaining broth if necessary.
Remove from heat. Stir in cheeses and salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately.

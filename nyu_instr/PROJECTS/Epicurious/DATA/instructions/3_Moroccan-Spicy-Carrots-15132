In a small bowl stir together raisins, saffron, and water and let mixture stand 30 minutes to soften raisins.
While raisin mixture is standing, cut carrots into 3-inch lengths and, using side of a grater with teardrop-shaped holes, grate sides of carrots, discarding woody center cores. In a small heavy skillet stir together coriander seeds, cumin, and oil and cook over moderate heat until fragrant, about 1 minute.
In a bowl toss together carrots, raisin mixture, spices, cilantro, pepper, and salt to taste.

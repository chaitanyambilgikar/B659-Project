Slice off the stem end of the pumpkin 2 1/2 inches from the top, scrape out the seeds and the membranes, reserving the seeds for toasting (procedure this page) if desired, and brush the inside of the pumpkin with 1 tablespoon of the butter, melted. Bake the pumpkin in a shallow baking pan in the middle of a preheated 375°F. oven for 1 hour, or until the pulp is tender, let it cool in the pan until it can be handled, and reserve enough of the liquid that has accumulated in the shell to measure 3/4 cup. (If necessary, add water to yield 3/4 cup.)
In a small saucepan combine the prunes with the reserved pumpkin liquid, simmer the mixture for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the prunes are very tender and the liquid is reduced to about 1/2 cup, and let it cool slightly. In a blender purée the prune mixture, adding additional water if necessary to achieve the desired consistency, and transfer the prune purée to a small bowl.
Discard any remaining liquid from the pumpkin, scoop out the pulp, and force it through a sieve into a heavy saucepan. Simmer the pumpkin purée, stirring frequently, for 15 to 20 minutes, or until it is thickened, add the sugar, a pinch of salt, and the remaining 2 tablespoons butter, and stir the mixture until the sugar is dissolved. Transfer the pumpkin purée to a serving bowl, drop spoonfuls of the prune purée onto the pumpkin purée, and with the blade of a knife make decorative swirls. Serve the pumpkin purée as a side dish.

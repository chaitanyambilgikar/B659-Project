Pour 1 1/2 cups apple cider over ham steaks (cider will not cover steaks). Whisk 2 tablespoons maple syrup and mustard in small bowl to blend; spread over top of ham steaks, dividing equally. Sprinkle with pepper. Bake ham steaks 40 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine 1 cup apple cider, 1 tablespoon maple syrup and Madeira in medium saucepan. Boil until reduced to 1/2 cup, about 15 minutes.

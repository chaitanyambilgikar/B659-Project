For Crust: Mix four and salt in processor. Add butter and shortening and process using on/off turns until mixture resembles coarse meal. Gradually add enough water to form moist clumps. Gather dough into 6 balls of equal size. Flatten each ball into disk. Wrap disks separately in plastic and refrigerate 1 hour. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Keep refrigerated. Let dough soften slightly at room temperature before rolling.)
Preheat oven to 400°F. Roll out each dough disk on floured surface to 6-inch round. Transfer rounds to 4-to 4 1/2-inch-diameter tart pans with removable bottoms. Fold overhang in, forming double-thick edges. Pierce crust in several places with fork. Freeze 15 minutes.
Line crusts with foil. Fill with dried beans. Bake until crusts are set, about 10 minutes. Remove foil and beans. Bake until crusts are golden, about 20 minutes. Transfer pans to racks and cool completely. Remove crusts from pans.
For Fool: Blend chopped strawberries, sugar and lemon juice in processor until almost smooth. Transfer to medium saucepan. Sprinkle gelatin over. Let stand 20 minutes to soften.
Stir strawberry mixture over low heat until mixture is just hot and gelatin dissolves, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Transfer to large bowl. Cover and refrigerate until beginning to thicken, stirring occasionally, about 2 hours.
Beat cream in medium bowl until stiff peaks form. Fold whipped cream into strawberry mixture. Chill fool until beginning to set, about 30 minutes.
Spoon fool into crusts; reserve any remaining fool for another use. Refrigerate until set, about 4 hours. Garnish each with 1 strawberry and serve.

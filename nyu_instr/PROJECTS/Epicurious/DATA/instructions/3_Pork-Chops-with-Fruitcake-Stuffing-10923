In a heavy skillet cook the onion and the bell pepper in 2 tablespoons of butter over moderately low heat, stirring, until the vegetables are softened, stir in the fruitcake and salt and pepper to taste, and let the stuffing cool. With a sharp paring knife make a 1-inch-long horizontal incision along the side of each chop and cut a deep, wide pocket in the chop. Fill the chops with the stuffing and close the openings with wooden picks. Pat the chops dry with paper towels and season them with salt and pepper.
In a heavy ovenproof skillet (preferably cast-iron) heat the remaining 1 tablespoon butter and the oil over moderately high heat until the foam subsides and in the fat brown the pork chops. Add 1/4 cup water, bake the chops, covered, in the middle of a preheated 350°F. oven, turning them once, for 30 minutes, and transfer them to plates. On top of the stove boil the pan juices until they are reduced to about 1/3 cup, strain them through a sieve into a bowl, and spoon them over the chops.

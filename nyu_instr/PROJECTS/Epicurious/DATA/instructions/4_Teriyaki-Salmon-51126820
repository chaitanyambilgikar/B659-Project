Position rack in middle of oven; heat oven to 450°F. In a bowl, combine teriyaki sauce, honey, vinegar, 1 teaspoon garlic, ginger and sesame oil. Place salmon in a shallow dish; sprinkle with 1 1/2 tablespoon teriyaki mixture; marinate 15 minutes. In a second bowl, toss brussels sprouts with 1 1/2 teaspoon garlic, 1/2 tablespoon canola oil, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Coat a rimmed sheet pan with cooking spray. Spread brussels sprouts in pan in a single layer; roast until light brown, 5 minutes. In second bowl, toss mushrooms with remaining 1/2 tablespoon canola oil, 1 1/2 teaspoon garlic, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Move brussels sprouts to center of pan; top with salmon; place mushrooms in pan around edges; roast, stirring mushrooms occasionally, until salmon is just cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes. Top salmon with remaining teriyaki mixture; serve over Brussels sprouts and mushrooms.

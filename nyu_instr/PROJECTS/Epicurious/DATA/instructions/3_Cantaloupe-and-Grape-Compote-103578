Scoop cantaloupe into balls with a melon-ball cutter and reserve rinds.
Bring wine, sugar, water, and zest to a boil in a small saucepan, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Squeeze juice from rinds into wine mixture. Boil, skimming froth, until reduced to about 1 cup, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from heat. Discard zest and stir in lime juice.
Combine grapes, melon balls, and warm syrup in a bowl and chill, covered, stirring occasionally, 2 hours.

Place 1/4 cup fava beans in small bowl; reserve for salad. Combine 1 1/2 cups fava beans, 1 cup water, and garlic in large skillet. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium; simmer uncovered until fava beans are tender, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. Drain favas, reserving cooking liquid. Transfer favas to processor; add 3 tablespoons oil and lemon juice. Puree until smooth, adding reserved cooking liquid by tablespoonfuls to moisten puree as needed. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer fava puree to another small bowl. DO AHEAD: Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and chill fava puree and whole fava beans separately. Bring puree to room temperature before using.
Finely grate enough peel from 1 orange to measure 1 teaspoon; squeeze 2 tablespoons juice from same orange. Cut off peel and white pith from remaining 2 oranges. Working over bowl and using small sharp knife, cut between membranes to release orange segments. Whisk orange peel, 2 tablespoons orange juice, vinegar, and 3 tablespoons oil in small bowl. Season vinaigrette with salt and pepper.
Toss greens, orange segments, 1/4 cup favas, and vinaigrette in large bowl.
Spread fava bean puree on warm baguette toasts, dividing equally. Top toasts with salad and serve.

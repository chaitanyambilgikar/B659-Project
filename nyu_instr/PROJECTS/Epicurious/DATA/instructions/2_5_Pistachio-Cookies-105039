Preheat oven to 300°F.
Blanch pistachios in boiling water 1 minute, then drain and peel (slip off skins with your fingers). Dry with paper towels. Spread in a shallow baking pan and bake in middle of oven until just dry, about 10 minutes, then cool completely.
Pulse nuts and confectioners sugar in a food processor until finely ground (be careful not to overprocess into a paste).
Stir together whole egg and yolks in a large bowl with a fork and stir in ground pistachios, a little at a time, until a dough forms (it will be slightly sticky). Add butter and rose water and knead to combine. Form dough into 2 disks.
Keeping 1 disk covered with plastic wrap, roll out other disk about 3/4 inch thick on a well-floured surface and cut out various shapes with floured cookie cutters.
Bake on an ungreased large baking sheet in middle of oven until crisp and bottoms are golden, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer cookies with a metal spatula to a rack to cool and dust with confectioners sugar while still warm. Make more cookies with remaining dough, rerolling scraps.

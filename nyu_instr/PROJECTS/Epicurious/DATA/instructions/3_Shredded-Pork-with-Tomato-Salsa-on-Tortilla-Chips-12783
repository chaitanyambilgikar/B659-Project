Arrange the tortilla rounds in one layer on baking sheets, cover them with a kitchen towel, and let them stand for 1 hour. In a large heavy skillet fry the rounds in batches in 3/4 inch of 375°F. oil for 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until they are pale golden and bubbling subsides. Transfer the tortilla chips with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain and season them with salt. The tortilla chips may be made 1 day in advance and kept in an airtight container.
In a heavy kettle arrange the pork strips in one layer, add enough water to barely cover them, and add the zest, the salt, the scallion, the garlic, and the cumin. Bring the water to a boil and simmer the mixture, covered partially, turning the pork occasionally, for 1 hour, or until the pork is just tender and the water is almost evaporated. Cook the pork, uncovered, over moderately low heat, turning it frequently, for 40 minutes to 1 hour more, or until it is browned well and begins to fall apart. Remove the pork with a slotted spoon from the kettle, discarding the zest, the scallion, and the garlic, and transfer it to paper towels to drain. Let the pork cool and using 2 forks or your fingers shred it. The shredded pork may be made 2 days in advance and kept covered and chilled.
Make the salsa: In a small bowl combine the tomatoes, the onion, the coriander, the jalapeño, the lime juice, and salt and pepper to taste.
Onto each tortilla chip spoon a heaping teaspoon of the pork and top it with some of the salsa and a coriander sprig.

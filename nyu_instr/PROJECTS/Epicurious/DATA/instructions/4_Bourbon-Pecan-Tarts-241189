Make crust: Put a baking sheet on middle rack of oven and preheat to 375°F. Mix crust ingredients in mixer at low speed until a dough forms, 5 to 7 minutes. Press 1/3 cup dough onto bottom and up side of each tart pan, making sides slightly thicker. Chill.
Make filling: Whisk together eggs, sugar, butter, corn syrups, bourbon, vanilla, and salt.
Divide pecans among tarts, then add filling. Bake on hot baking sheet in oven until filling is just set and crust is golden-brown, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool on racks completely before removing sides of pans.

Melt butter in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add leeks, parsnips, and apples. Cover; cook until vegetables begin to soften, stirring often, about 20 minutes. Add 4 cups water. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium. Simmer uncovered until vegetables are very tender, about 20 minutes. Cool slightly.
Working in batches, puree vegetable mixture with milk in blender until smooth, thinning soup with more water if desired. Return soup to pot. Season soup with sugar, salt, and pepper. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cool slightly. Refrigerate uncovered until cold, then cover and keep refrigerated.)
Cut enough reserved green parts of leeks into matchstick-size strips to measure 1 cup. Cook in medium saucepan of boiling water until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain.
Bring soup to simmer. Ladle into bowls. Garnish with leek strips and serve.

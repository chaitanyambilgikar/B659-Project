Preheat oven to 250°F. Divide all bread cubes between 2 rimmed baking sheets. Bake until bread is dry, about 1 1/2 hours. Transfer bread to large bowl.
Sauté bacon in large skillet until crisp. Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towels. Discard all but 1 tablespoon drippings from skillet. Add butter to drippings and melt over medium heat. Add onion; sauté until soft, about 7 minutes. Add onion, chives, tarragon, salt, pepper, and reserved bacon to bowl with bread; toss to combine. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
Butter 9x9x2-inch baking dish. Add chicken broth to bread mixture and toss to moisten. Transfer stuffing to prepared dish.
Cover stuffing with foil and bake 40 minutes (50 minutes if refrigerated). Uncover and bake until lightly browned on top, about 20 minutes longer.

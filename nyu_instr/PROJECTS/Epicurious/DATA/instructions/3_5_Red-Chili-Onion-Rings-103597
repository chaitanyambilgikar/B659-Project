Place onions in bowl. Pour milk over; let stand 30 minutes, tossing occasionally.
Whisk flour, Red Chili Powder, cumin, paprika and salt in large bowl.
Pour enough oil into large pot to reach depth of 3 inches. Heat to 350°F. Working with a few onion rings at a time, shake off excess milk. Dip into flour mixture, coating lightly. Add onion rings to pot; deep-fry until golden, about 45 seconds. Drain on paper towels and serve.

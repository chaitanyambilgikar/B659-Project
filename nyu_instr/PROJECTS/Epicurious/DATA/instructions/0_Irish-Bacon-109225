Pat bacon dry and cook in 2 batches in oil (1 tablespoon per batch) in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat, turning over once, until browned, about 4 minutes per batch (use caution; oil will splatter). Transfer with tongs to a paper-towel-lined platter and keep warm, loosely covered with foil.

Preheat oven to 500°F.
Cut potatoes into 1/2-inch pieces and finely chop garlic. In a bowl stir together potatoes, half of garlic, half of rosemary, oil, and salt and pepper to taste. Pat chicken dry and season well with salt and pepper. Sprinkle chicken with remaining garlic and rosemary. In a roasting pan arrange chicken in one layer and scatter potatoes around chicken. Roast chicken and potatoes in middle of oven until chicken is cooked through and potatoes are crisp, about 35 minutes.

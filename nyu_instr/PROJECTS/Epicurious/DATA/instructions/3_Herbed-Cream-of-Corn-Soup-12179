In a blender blend the corn, the broth, the scallion, and the thyme until the mixture is smooth. Strain the mixture through a sieve set over a bowl, pressing hard on the solids, discard the solids, and stir in the half-and-half and the parsley. Season the soup with salt and pepper and chill it, covered, for 1 hour, or until it is cold.

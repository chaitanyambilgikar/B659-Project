Cook bacon in a 4- to 5-quart wide heavy pot over moderate heat, turning over occasionally, until fat is rendered and bacon is crisp, about 5 minutes. Reserve bacon for another use, then add butter and onion to bacon fat and cook, stirring frequently, until onion is browned, 7 to 8 minutes. Stir in paprika and cook, stirring frequently, 1 minute.
Pat chuck and liver dry and add to onion mixture, then cook, stirring frequently, until meat is browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Sprinkle with flour and cook, stirring frequently, 1 minute. Add wine and salt and bring to a boil, then reduce heat and gently simmer, covered, stirring occasionally, 1 hour. Transfer liver to a cutting board using tongs, then mince. Return liver to pot and add bell pepper. Gently simmer, covered, stirring occasionally, until beef is tender, about 1 hour.
While meat is simmering, peel potatoes and cut into 1/2-inch pieces. Put potatoes in a 2- to 3-quart saucepan and cover with salted cold water, then simmer until just tender, 12 to 15 minutes. Add potatoes to soup along with 3 cups potato cooking liquid and salt to taste and simmer 5 minutes. Serve sprinkled with dill.

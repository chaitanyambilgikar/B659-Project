Preheat oven to 400°F.
In a medium saucepan over moderately high heat, warm the canola oil. Add the rice, vermicelli noodles, onion, celery, bell pepper, and scallions, and sauté, stirring frequently, until golden and toasted, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the garlic, turmeric, cumin, and cayenne, and sauté, stirring constantly, until the spices are toasted, about 30 seconds. Add the chicken stock and salt, stir thoroughly, and bring to a boil. Transfer to the baking dish. DO AHEAD: The rice can be prepared up to this point, covered, and refrigerated up to 8 hours. Bring to room temperature before proceeding.
Dot the rice with the butter, cover the baking dish snugly with foil, and bake for 15 minutes. Remove the foil and continue baking until the rice is tender, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle with parsley and serve hot.

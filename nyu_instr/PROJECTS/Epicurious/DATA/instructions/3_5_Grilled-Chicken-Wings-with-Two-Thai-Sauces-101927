Make peanut sauce: Mince shallots and garlic. In a food processor finely grind peanuts until they begin to get oily. In a small heavy saucepan heat oil over moderate heat until hot but not smoking and cook shallots, garlic, and curry paste, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in ground peanuts and coconut milk and simmer, uncovered, stirring frequently, until mixture is slightly thickened, about 3 minutes. Stir in lime juice, brown sugar, and salt to taste. (If sauce is too thick, stir in additional coconut milk.) Peanut sauce may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered. Bring sauce to room temperature before serving.

Cool sauce to room temperature. Gai yang sauce may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered. Bring sauce to room temperature before serving.

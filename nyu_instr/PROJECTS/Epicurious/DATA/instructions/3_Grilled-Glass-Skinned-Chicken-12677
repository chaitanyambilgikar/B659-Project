In large sealable plastic bags or in a baking dish large enough to hold chicken in one layer combine chicken and recado, coating chicken well. (Marinate chicken, covered and chilled, turning it occasionally, at least 4 hours and up to 1 day.)
Preheat oven to 250°F. and line a large baking sheet with foil.
Remove chicken from marinade, letting excess drip off, and discard marinade. Bake chicken, skin sides up, on baking sheet in middle of oven until cooked through, about 50 minutes, and cool completely. (Chicken may be prepared up to this point 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.)
Prepare grill.
Put chicken, skin sides down, around edges (to avoid hottest part of coals) of an oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals and grill chicken very slowly, turning it occasionally, until fat is rendered and skin is crisp, about 30 minutes. (Chicken will be slightly burned and almost transparent in some places and red in color and fragile in other places.) The marinade burns easily, but don't be discouraged-a little burned achiote tastes good.
Serve chicken with salsa, rajas, guacamole, and tortillas.

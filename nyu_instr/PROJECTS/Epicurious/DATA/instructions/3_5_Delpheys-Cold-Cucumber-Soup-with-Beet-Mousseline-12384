In a large heavy saucepan cook onion and 1 tablespoon dill in oil over moderately low heat, stirring occasionally, until onion is softened. Add broth, lemon juice, and cucumbers and simmer 20 minutes. In a blender purée mixture in batches until smooth and cool. Stir in white pepper and salt to taste. Chill soup, covered, until cold, at least 4 hours and up to 1 day.
Force soup through a sieve into a bowl and whisk in sour cream and remaining 2 tablespoons dill.
Serve soup topped with a dollop of beet mousseline and garnished with dill sprigs.

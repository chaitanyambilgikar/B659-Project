Remove zest from oranges and lemons with a vegetable peeler in long 1/2-inch-wide pieces and cut pieces lengthwise into julienne strips, reserving orange and lemon zests separately.
In a small saucepan cover orange zest with water and bring to a boil. Simmer zest 5 minutes and drain in a sieve, discarding liquid. Repeat procedure with orange zest 2 more times. In pan bring orange zest, 1/4 cup sugar, and 1/4 cup water to a boil over moderate heat and simmer until liquid is reduced to a thick syrup. Cool orange zest in syrup. Make candied lemon zest in same manner. Zests may be made 1 week ahead and chilled in an airtight container.

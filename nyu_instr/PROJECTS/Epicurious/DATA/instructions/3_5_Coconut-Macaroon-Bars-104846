Preheat oven to 350°F. Spray 13x9x2-inch metal baking pan with nonstick spray. Blend 1 1/4 cups flour, 1/3 cup sugar and 1/2 teaspoon salt in processor. Add diced butter and process, using on/off turns, until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add 1 egg yolk and cream; blend until dough comes together in clumps. Press dough evenly over bottom of prepared pan. Bake crust until pale golden, about 15 minutes. Transfer to rack. Maintain oven temperature.

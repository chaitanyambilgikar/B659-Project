Combine chicken stock, oyster sauce, plum sauce, mirin, orange juice, chili-garlic sauce and kaffir lime leaves in heavy small saucepan over medium-high heat. Simmer until sauce is reduced to 1 cup, whisking occasionally, about 25 minutes. Whisk in apple cider vinegar and sugar. Remove from heat. (Sauce can be prepared 3 days ahead. Cover and refrigerate.) Remove lime leaves.
Preheat oven to 350°F. Heat sesame oil in heavy large skillet over high heat. Sprinkle pork with salt and pepper. Sauté pork until golden brown, about 1 minute per side. Transfer pork to work surface; brush each piece with sauce and dip in pistachios, turning to coat. Transfer pork to rimmed baking sheet. Bake until thermometer inserted into center registers 150°F, about 10 minutes.
Bring sauce to boil. Add butter one piece at a time, whisking just until melted before adding next piece. Transfer 2 pork medallions to each of 6 plates. Drizzle sauce around pork. Top with fried leeks, if desired. Serve immediately.

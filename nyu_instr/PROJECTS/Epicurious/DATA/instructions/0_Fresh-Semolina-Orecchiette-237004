Stir together semolina, flour, and a pinch of salt in a large bowl and make a well in center. Add lukewarm water to well and, using a fork, gradually stir in enough flour, pulling in flour closest to water, until a dough forms (some of flour mixture will not be incorporated). Transfer dough to a work surface.
Sift remaining flour mixture in bowl through a medium-mesh sieve into another bowl, discarding any hard clumps.
Knead dough, incorporating some of flour mixture as dough becomes sticky, until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.
Divide dough into 8 pieces, then wrap each piece separately in plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature 1 hour.
Line 2 large trays with dry clean kitchen towels (not terry cloth) and dust your hands with some remaining flour mixture. Remove plastic wrap from 1 piece of dough and roll dough on work surface to create a 1/2-inch-thick rope (2 to 3 feet long). Cut into 1/3-inch pieces with a sharp knife, separating pieces as cut so they do not touch. Lightly toss cut pieces with some remaining flour mixture.
Put 1 piece of dough, a cut side down, on work surface (if necessary, reform round shape; keep remaining pieces covered with a clean kitchen towel). Dust your thumb with some flour mixture and press down on dough, pushing away from you and twisting thumb slightly to form an indented curled shape (like an ear). Transfer to a lined tray. Make more orecchiette with remaining cut pieces in same manner, transferring to lined tray. Repeat rolling, cutting, and forming with remaining 7 pieces of dough in same manner, transferring to trays.

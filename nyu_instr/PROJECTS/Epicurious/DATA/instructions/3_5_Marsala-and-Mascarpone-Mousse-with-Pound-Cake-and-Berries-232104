Whisk sugar, 1/3 cup Marsala, and egg yolks to blend in large metal bowl. Set over pan of barely simmering water (do not allow bowl to touch water); whisk constantly until mixture thickens and thermometer registers 160°F, about 6 minutes. Place bowl over large bowl filled with ice; continue whisking until zabaglione cools, about 3 minutes.
Whisk mascarpone to loosen in another large bowl; in 3 additions, foldin zabaglione. Whip cream, vanilla, and cinnamon in small bowl until soft peaks form; fold into zabaglione.
Sprinkle pound cake strips with remaining 3 tablespoons Marsala. Arrange 4 strips in each of 6 goblets. Sprinkle a few raspberries over; top with 1/2 cup mousse. Sprinkle remaining raspberries over. Cover; chill 1 hour or overnight.

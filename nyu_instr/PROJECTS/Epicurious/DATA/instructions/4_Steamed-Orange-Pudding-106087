Stir together baking soda and orange juice.
Toss raisins with flour.
Beat together butter, sugar, and salt with an electric mixer at medium speed until pale and fluffy. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Add orange juice, raisins, marmalade, and bread crumbs and mix at low speed until blended. Spoon batter into lightly buttered mold.
Cover mold with a sheet of foil and secure it tightly with kitchen string (if mold has a lid, use that instead). Put mold on a metal rack in a deep pot. Add enough boiling-hot water to pot to reach halfway up mold, then cover pot and steam pudding in simmering water, adding more boiling water as needed, until surface of pudding feels dry and firm, about 2 hours. Cool on another rack 5 minutes. Loosen edge of pudding with a thin knife and invert onto a serving plate. Serve warm.

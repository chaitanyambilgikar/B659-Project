Preheat oven to 350°F with rack in middle.
Put baguette slices on a baking sheet and bake until pale golden, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool.
While bread is toasting, boil cider, vinegar, honey, and thyme in a small, nonreactive saucepan until syrupy and reduced to about 1/4 cup, about 10 minutes. Cool to room temperature.
Spread toasts with créme fraîche and top with salmon. Drizzle with malt syrup.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place oven racks in the bottom third and top third of the oven. Line an 8-inch square baking pan with heavy-duty aluminum foil, making sure the foil is tucked into all the corners and that there is at least 1 inch overhanging the top of the pan.
Combine the flour, baking powder, and salt in a small bowl.
Combine the butter and sugar in a medium-size mixing blow and cream together with an electric mixer until smooth. Stir in the egg. Stir in the vanilla extract. Stir in the flour mixture.
Use a spatula to smooth half the mixture in an even layer across the bottom of the pan. Place the bowl in the freezer, along with the bowl containing the remaining half of the shortbread dough, for 15 minutes to firm up.
Remove the pan from the freezer and spread the preserves in an even layer on top of the dough. Pinch off pieces of the remaining dough and scatter them evenly over the jam.
Place the pan on the bottom oven rack and bake for 20 minutes. Transfer the pan to the top rack and bake until the top is ight golden, another 5 to 10 minutes. Let the pan cool completely on a wire rack.
Grasping the overhanging foil on either side of the pan, lift out the squares and place them on a cutting board. Cut into 16 squares. Jam and shortbread squares will keep at room temperature in an airtight container for 2 to 3 days.

1. Preheat the oven to 400°F. Fit the puff pastry into the tart pan and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
2. Peel the peaches. Cut them and the nectarines into thin wedges. Reserve.
3. In a small bowl whisk together the cream, sugar, egg and th e nut powders. If you don't find hazelnut powder, simply substitute almond powder.
4. When the pastry is chilled, arrange the fruits in it in concentric circles, mounding any extra slices in the center. Pour the cream evenly over the fruit, and bake the tart in the middle of the oven until the cream and fruit are golden on top, about 45 minutes. Remove from the oven and remove the tart from the pastry ring. When the tart is almost cool, slip it off the tart pan onto a serving platter, and serve.

Make syrup: Simmer maple syrup and dried fruits in a saucepan, uncovered, until fruits are plumped, about 5 minutes.
Remove from heat and stir in juice.
Make pancakes: Preheat oven to 250°F.
Whisk together flour, cornmeal, baking powder and soda, sugar, and salt.
Whisk together cream cheese and eggs in a large bowl and gradually whisk in milk until smooth. Add flour mixture and whisk until just combined.
Heat a large griddle over moderate heat until hot enough to make drops of water scatter over its surface, then brush with some butter.
Spoon tablespoons of batter onto griddle, without crowding, to form 2 1/2-inch cakes. Cook pancakes 1 to 2 minutes on each side, or until golden and puffed. Transfer to a baking sheet and keep warm in oven. Make more pancakes in same manner, brushing griddle with butter for each batch.
Serve pancakes in stacks with syrup.

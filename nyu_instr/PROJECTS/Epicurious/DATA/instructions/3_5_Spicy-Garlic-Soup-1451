Melt butter in heavy large saucepan over medium-low heat. Add garlic and sauté until golden, about 3 minutes. Add flour and stir until mixture is just golden, about 2 minutes. Add stock and bring to boil, stirring constantly. Reduce heat and simmer 15 minutes. Season with cayenne and salt. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Reheat before serving.)

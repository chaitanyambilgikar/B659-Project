If using wings, cut each wing at the joints into 3 pieces. In a stockpot or kettle combine the chicken parts with 14 cups cold water. Bring the water to a boil, skimming the froth, add 1/2 cold water, and bring the mixture to a simmer, skimming the froth. Add the onions, stuck with the cloves, the garlic, the celery, the carrots, the salt, the parsley, the peppercorns, the thyme, and the bay leaf and simmer the mixture, skimming the froth, for 3 hours. Strain the stock through a fine sieve into a bowl and let it cool to warm. If a more concentrated flavor is desired boil the stock until it is reduced to the desired concentration. Chill the stock and remove the fat. The stock keeps, covered and chilled, for 1 week if it is brought to a boil every 2 days and then allowed to cool to warm, uncovered, before being be chilled again, and keeps, frozen, for 3 months.

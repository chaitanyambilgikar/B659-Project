In a large bowl, toss all ingredients except the beef stock until well blended. Cover and refrigerate 24 hours, tossing occasionally.
Preheat the oven to 425°F. Transfer the contents of the refrigerated bowl to a roasting pan large enough to accommodate a single layer of vegetables covered by a single layer of meat. Add the stock and roast, basting and turning the lamb frequently, until the meat is very tender, about 1 hour 45 minutes.
Reduce the oven temperature to 350°F. Remove the lamb from the pan and set it aside. Skim and discard as much fat as possible from the pan liquids. Place the pan over high heat and boil until the liquids reduce to about 1 1/4 cups. Transfer the meat to a smaller roasting pan and strain the reduced sauce over it. Place the meat in the oven and roast, turning meat every 10 minutes, until extremely tender, brown, and caramelized, about 30–40 minutes.
Strain the juices from the pan and, if necessary, reduce further over moderately high heat; there should be 1/2 cup of finished sauce. Transfer the lamb to a serving platter and spoon the sauce over it.
Recommended wine—I like Abbazia di Rosazzo's Ronco dei Roseti with roast baby lamb.

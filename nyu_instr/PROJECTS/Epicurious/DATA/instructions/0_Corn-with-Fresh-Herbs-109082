Husk the corn and rub off the silk with a lightly moistened towel. Holding one ear upright at a time, cut off the kernels in ribbons and put them in a bowl. Separate the kernels by rubbing them with your fingers.
Pour the oil into a large, preferably nonstick, lidded pan or wok and set over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, put in the mustard seeds and cumin seeds. As soon as the mustard seeds begin to pop, a matter of seconds, put in the kalonji seeds. Stir once, then add the ginger and chilies. Stir for 30 seconds, put in the corn, cilantro, mint, scallions, and dill, and toss well to mix. Add 4 tablespoons of water, the lemon juice, salt, and black pepper. Toss again to mix and cover. When steam begins to escape from under the lid, reduce the heat to low and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Toss again and taste for a balance of seasonings, making any adjustments you think necessary. If you like, stir in the butter just before serving.

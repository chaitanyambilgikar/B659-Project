Preheat oven to 425°F.
Beat together butter, brown sugar, and salt in a bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes, then beat in egg and vanilla until just combined. Sift flour over batter, then fold in. Fold in walnuts.
Drop level 1/2 teaspoons batter about 2 inches apart onto well-buttered baking sheets and pat into 1 1/2-inch rounds with back of a fork. (To keep fork from sticking to batter, dip fork in water, then tap off excess water onto a paper towel.)
Bake cookies in batches in middle of oven until pale golden around edges, 5 to 7 minutes. Carefully loosen hot cookies with a metal spatula and transfer to a rack to cool. (If cookies become too firm to remove without breaking, return to oven for a few seconds to soften.)

Bring 3 cups chicken broth to boil in heavy medium saucepan. Add rice. Bring to boil, reduce heat to low, cover and cook until chicken broth is absorbed, about 20 minutes. Turn off heat and let stand 5 minutes.
Fluff rice with fork. Transfer to large bowl. Mix in 5 tablespoons olive oil, then all remaining ingredients. Season salad to taste with pepper. (Salad can be prepared 4 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.)

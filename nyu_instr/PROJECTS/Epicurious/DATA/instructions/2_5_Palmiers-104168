1. On a work surface sprinkled with 1/4 cup sugar, place one sheet pastry. Sprinkle top of sheet evenly with 1/4 cup sugar. Using a rolling pin, roll the pastry sheet into a 12-inch square, pressing the sugar into both sides of the pastry.
2. Roll up one edge to middle of pastry sheet. Roll up parallel edge in same manner so that the two rolls are touching; press gently to seal roll. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and chill until firm, about 30 minutes. Repeat with remaining pastry and sugar. Pastry rolls may be made 2 weeks ahead and frozen.
3. Heat oven to 400°F. Cut chilled pastry roll with a sharp knife crosswise into slices just under 1/4-inch thick. (If roll is frozen, desired number of cookies may be cut frozen and the remaining log frozen again for later use.)
4. Place cookies 2 inches apart on an ungreased cookie sheet. Keep remaining pastry well chilled. Bake palmiers in batches in middle of oven until tops are golden brown. Using an offset spatula, turn and continue baking 10 to 12 minutes more. Transfer cookies to a rack to cool.

Combine clams, mussels and wine in heavy large pot; bring to boil over medium-high heat. Cover pot; cook until shellfish open, about 7 minutes (discard any that do not open). Using tongs, transfer shellfish to bowl; cover with foil to keep warm. Reserve shellfish juices.
Meanwhile, cook pasta in medium pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite.
Drain pasta; return to same pot. Add reserved shellfish juices, pesto, sun-dried tomatoes and crushed red pepper. Toss over medium heat just until sauce coats pasta. Season with salt and pepper. Divide pasta between 2 bowls; top with shellfish and serve.

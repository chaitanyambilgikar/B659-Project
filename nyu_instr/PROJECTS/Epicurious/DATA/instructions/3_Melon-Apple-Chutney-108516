Wrap cinnamon stick, cloves, and allspice in cheesecloth and tie with string to form a bag. Crush spices gently in bag with a rolling pin or bottom of a heavy skillet.
Bring melon, apple, sugar, vinegar, currants, ginger, cheesecloth bag, and a pinch of salt to a boil in a 1- to 1 1/2-quart heavy saucepan, then reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until syrup is thick and most of liquid is evaporated, 30 to 35 minutes. Discard cheesecloth bag and cool chutney. (Syrup will continue to thicken as it cools.)

For crust: Mix flour, powdered sugar and salt in processor. Add butter and cut in using on/off turns until mixture resembles coarse meal. Mix in beaten egg. Mix in enough ice water by teaspoonfuls to form moist clumps. Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk. Wrap in plastic; refrigerate at least 30 minutes. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Keep chilled. Soften slightly at room temperature before rolling out.)
Roll out dough on floured surface to 14-inch round. Roll up dough on rolling pin; transfer to 11-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom. Trim dough to 1-inch overhang. Fold in overhang to form double-thick sides extending 1/4 inch above sides of pan, pressing to adhere. Pierce crust with fork in several places. Freeze crust 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375°F. Bake crust until set and light golden, piercing with fork if crust bubbles, about 18 minutes. Cool completely.
For filling: Blend eggs and next 4 ingredients in processor. Add cream and blend until smooth. Pour into cooled crust. Bake tart until filling is set, about 25 minutes. Cool. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
Preheat broiler. To make foil cover to protect crust edges during broiling, cut out 12-inch round of foil. Cut out center of foil, leaving 2-inch-wide circle. Place foil circle atop tart, covering crust edges. Dust center of tart with powdered sugar. Broil tart until sugar melts and is golden, watching closely and rotating tart for even broiling, about 1 minute.
Transfer pan to rack. Remove foil circle. Cool tart at least 30 minutes. Remove pan sides. Serve tart slightly warm or at room temperature with Blackberry Purée.

Keep the jar in a cool place. This basic dressing may be used plain or with herbs for a tossed green salad; it may be spiced with onion and garlic for marinating meat, vegetables or fish; or it may sweetened with honey or sugar as a dressing for fruit salads. Use it whenever one of the recipes calls for French Dressing. Shake well before using.

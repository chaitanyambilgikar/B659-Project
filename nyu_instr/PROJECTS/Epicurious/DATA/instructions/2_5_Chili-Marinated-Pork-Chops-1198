Heat heavy large skillet over medium heat; add chilies. Using spatula, press down on chilies until beginning to soften and darken, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer chilies to work surface; cool. Cut chilies in half lengthwise; remove seeds and stems and discard. Place in bowl. Add enough boiling water to cover; let stand until chilies soften, about 1 hour.
Drain chilies, reserving 1/2 cup soaking liquid. Place chilies in blender. Add vinegar, garlic, cloves, oregano, cinnamon, thyme and reserved soaking liquid. Blend until smooth paste forms, about 2 minutes. Arrange pork in shallow dish. Spoon chili paste over pork; turn to coat. Cover, chill at least 6 hours or overnight.
Heat oil in large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Remove pork from marinade, scraping off excess chili paste. Season pork with salt and pepper. Add pork to skillet; cook until brown and cooked through, about 5 minutes per side.

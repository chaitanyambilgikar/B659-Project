For pork: Place first 5 ingredients in mortar; mash into paste with pestle. Stir in 1/3 cup broth and juice. Transfer marinade to large resealable plastic bag. Add pork and seal. Refrigerate 12 to 14 hours, turning occasionally.
Preheat oven to 350°F. Transfer pork and marinade to large roasting pan. Roast until thermometer inserted into center registers 145°F, basting occasionally with pan juices and adding more broth by 1/4 cupfuls if dry, about 1 hour 45 minutes.
Transfer pork to platter; let stand 20 minutes before serving. Slice pork and serve with juices and guavas alongside.

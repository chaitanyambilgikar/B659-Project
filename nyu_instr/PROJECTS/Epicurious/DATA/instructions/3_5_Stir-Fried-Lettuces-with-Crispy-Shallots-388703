Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over low heat. Add shallots; cook, stirring often, until golden brown, about 12 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon to a paper towel-lined plate and season lightly with salt and pepper (shallots will crisp as they cool).
Increase heat to medium; add sausage and next 3 ingredients to same skillet; stir for 2 minutes. Add 1/4 cup water; scrape up any browned bits. Increase heat to medium-high; add lettuce and watercress and cook, tossing often, just until wilted, 1-2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle fried shallots over. Serve with brown rice.

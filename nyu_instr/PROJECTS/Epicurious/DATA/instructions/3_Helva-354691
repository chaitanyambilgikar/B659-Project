Bring the sugar, milk, and water to a boil. Lower the heat, and simmer for 15 minutes. Cool.
In a heavy pot, melt the butter and sauté the farina and the nuts until light brown. Do this slowly, over low heat for 20 minutes or more, stirring constantly. Be careful not to burn the farina.
Add the milk mix and the cinnamon to the sautéed nuts and farina, stirring constantly. Lower heat, stir and simmer until thick, about 5 minutes.
Remove from the heat, cover, and stir from time to time. After 10 minutes, turn into a lightly buttered mold. Chill overnight. Unmold, sprinkle with additional cinnamon. Slice thinly and serve with whipped cream.

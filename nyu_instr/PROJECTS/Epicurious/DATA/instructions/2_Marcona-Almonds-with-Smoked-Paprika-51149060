Preheat oven to 350°F. Toss almonds, oil, and paprika on a rimmed baking sheet to coat; spread out in a single layer and toast, tossing occasionally, until dark golden brown, 8-10 minutes. Transfer to a bowl, sprinkle with salt, and toss to coat. Let cool. DO AHEAD: Nuts can be toasted 1 week ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.

Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-low heat. Add zucchini, sausage and mushrooms and sauté until vegetables are almost tender, about 5 minutes. Add sun-dried tomatoes and sauté until vegetables are tender, about 3 minutes longer. Remove skillet from heat; stir in basil and oregano.
Preheat oven to 450°F. Arrange pizza shells on small cookie sheet. Spread half of pizza sauce over each. Sprinkle each with half of Parmesan. Divide vegetable mixture between pizzas. Top each with half of mozzarella and half of goat cheese. Bake until mozzarella melts and pizzas are heated through, about 9 minutes.

Cook beans in medium pot of boiling salted water until just crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Drain. Rinse under cold running water to cool quickly. Pat beans dry. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover with plastic wrap and chill.)
Heat oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Add green beans and half of almonds and toss until heated through, about 3 minutes. Season beans with salt and pepper. Transfer beans to platter. Sprinkle with remaining almonds.

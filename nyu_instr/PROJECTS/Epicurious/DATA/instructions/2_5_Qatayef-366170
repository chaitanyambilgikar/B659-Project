To make the batter Stir the sugar and yeast into the warm water. Let sit for 10 minutes, until foamy. Combine the whole-wheat flour, all-purpose flour, and salt. Add the yeast mixture, mix well, and let sit in a warm place for 30 minutes.
To make the filling Combine the walnuts, goat cheese, honey, and orange-blossom water.
To make the syrup Combine the sugar and water in a saucepan over medium heat, and heat, stirring, until the sugar is dissolved. Add the corn syrup and cinnamon and continue to cook, stirring, until thickened, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the orange-blossom water.
To cook Butter a large griddle, and set it over low heat. Fill a frying pan with 1 inch of oil, and set it over medium heat. Line plates with paper towels for draining the fried cakes.
Drop a small piece of bread into the oil; when it browns, the oil is ready for frying. Pour the batter onto the buttered griddle in 4- to 5-inch round cakes. When bubbles form in the tops of the cakes, transfer the cakes to a plate (do not flip them). Spread 1 1/2 tablespoons of the walnut-cheese filling on each cake, on the uncooked side. Fold the cake in half and press the edges together to seal.
Drop the cakes into the hot oil in the frying pan. Fry the cakes for 15 to 20 seconds, or until golden on one side, then flip them and cook until the other side is golden. Drain on paper towels.
To serve Transfer the cakes to serving plates, and serve with the syrup.
VariationPalestinian Coconut Qatayef Replace the goat cheese with unsweetened shredded coconut and the orange-blossom water with lemon juice.

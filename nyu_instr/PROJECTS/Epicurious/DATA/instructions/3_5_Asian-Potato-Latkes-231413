Coarsely grate potatoes with a hand grater or in a food processor fitted with coarse grating disk. Squeeze between several thicknesses of paper towel to remove as much moisture as possible.
Transfer potatoes to bowl of an electric mixer, add cilantro and ginger, and toss with a spoon. Stir in breadcrumbs, cream, and butter, and season with salt and pepper.
Using paddle attachment, beat mixture at low speed for 2 minutes to blend. If mixture seems too wet to form into balls, beat in more breadcrumbs, a few teaspoons at a time, until desired consistency is reached. Let the mixture rest, uncovered, for 30 minutes.
Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat without any oil. Using a tablespoon, form mixture into 1-inch balls. Place 6 to 8 balls in skillet and cook, pressing gently with spatula to flatten, until undersides are golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn pancakes over and continue to cook, pressing occasionally, until golden brown and cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes more.
Use remaining batter to make more pancakes in same manner. Serve warm.

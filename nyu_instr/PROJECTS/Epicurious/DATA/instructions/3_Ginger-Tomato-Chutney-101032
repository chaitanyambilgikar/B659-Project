Combine vinegar, brown sugar and ginger in small saucepan. Stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Add tomatoes with juices and cinnamon. Bring mixture to boil. Reduce heat; simmer uncovered until chutney is slightly thickened, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes. Discard cinnamon. (Chutney can be prepared 2 days ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Rewarm over low heat or bring to room temperature before using.)

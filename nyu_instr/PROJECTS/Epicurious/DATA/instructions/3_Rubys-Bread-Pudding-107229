Preheat oven to 350°F.
Arrange bread in 1 layer in a shallow baking pan just large enough to hold it in 1 layer. Pour water over bread and soak 30 seconds. Turn bread over and soak until softened but not falling apart (parts of crust will remain firm), about 4 minutes more. Squeeze water from bread, then transfer bread to a buttered 13- by 9-inch glass baking dish or other 2 1/2-quart shallow baking dish.
Whisk together eggs, milk, butter, sugars, vanilla, nutmeg, and salt and stir in raisins and pineapple. Pour mixture over bread and stir gently until combined well.
Bake pudding, uncovered, in middle of oven until custard is just set, 45 to 50 minutes.

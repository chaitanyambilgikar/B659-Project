Cover farro with cold water in a bowl and soak 30 minutes, then drain in a colander.
Bring farro, stock, and water (2 cups) to a boil in a 4-quart heavy pot, then reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, until farro is tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain in colander.
While farro cooks, mince garlic and mash to a paste with 1/4 teaspoon salt using a large heavy knife. Transfer to a large bowl and add fennel, olives, oil, vinegar, pepper, and remaining 1 1/4 teaspoons salt.
Cut carrots into 3/4-inch-thick long diagonal slices with slicer, then, using a knife, cut slices into 3/4-inch-thick matchsticks. Add carrots to fennel mixture along with drained farro and parsley, tossing to combine well.

Mix mustard and 2 teaspoons thyme in small bowl. Place beef in heavy large roasting pan. Coat beef with mustard mixture. Cover; let stand 1 1/2 hours at room temperature or refrigerate overnight.
Preheat oven to 375°F. Scrape off marinade from beef; reserve marinade. Roast beef 1 hour. Brush reserved marinade over beef. Roast until thermometer inserted into center of beef registers 120°F, about 10 minutes longer. Transfer beef to cutting board. Tent with foil to keep warm.

In a heavy skillet cook the onion in 2 tablespoons of the lard over moderately low heat, stirring, until it is golden, stir in the cayenne and salt and pepper to taste, and reserve the mixture. Onto a sheet of wax paper sift together the flour, the baking powder, and the salt and sift the mixture again into a bowl. Add the remaining 5 tablespoons lard and blend the mixture until it resembles fine meal. Stir in the milk, stirring until the dough is combined well, turn the dough onto a floured surface, and knead it for 30 seconds. Pat the dough into a 9-inch square, press it evenly into a greased 9-inch-square pan, and top it with the reserved onion mixture. In a small bowl whisk together the egg, the sour cream, and salt and pepper to taste, pour the mixture over the onion mixture, smoothing it with a spatula to cover the onion mixture evenly, and bake the bread in the middle of a preheated 450°F. oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until it is cooked through. Cut the bread into squares and serve it hot.

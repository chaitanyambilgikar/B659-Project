In a bowl with an electric mixer cream together the shortening, the butter, and the sugar, add the vanilla, the lemon extract, the zest, and the juice, beating, and beat the mixture until it is smooth. Into the bowl sift together the flour, the baking powder, the baking soda, and the salt and blend the dough well. On a piece of wax paper form the dough into a log 1 1/2 inches in diameter, using the paper as a guide. Chill the log, wrapped in wax paper and foil, for 2 hours. The dough may be made up to 3 months in advance and kept wrapped well and frozen. Cut the log into 1/8-inch slices with a sharp knife and bake the cookies 2 inches apart on ungreased baking sheets in the middle of a preheated 350°F. oven for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the edges are just golden. Transfer the cookies immediately with a metal spatula to racks, let them cool, and sift the confectioners' sugar lightly over the lemon thins.

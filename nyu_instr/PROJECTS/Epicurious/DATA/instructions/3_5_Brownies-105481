1. Preheat the oven to 350° F. Butter and flour a 9x13-inch square pan.
2. Place the softened butter in a large bowl or the bowl of an electricmixer, and whisk until it is pale yellow and light. Add the sugar andwhisk until the mixture is light and fluffy. Whisk in the cooled chocolate, then add the eggs one at a time, whisking after each addition. Whisk in the vanilla, then sift in the flour, cocoa and the salt and fold them in until combined. Fold in the nuts until they are well distributed throughout the batter.
3. Transfer the batter to the prepared baking pan, smoothing it outevenly, and bake in the center of the oven until the brownies have puffed slightly around the edges and are shiny on the surface, about 30 minutes. They will be very moist in the center. Remove from the oven and let cool before cutting into squares.

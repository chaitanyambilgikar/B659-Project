Trim the narrow end of each radish half so that the half will stand upright and with a small melon-ball cutter hollow out a 3/4-inch cavity in each half, dropping the halves as they are hollowed into a bowl of ice and cold water. In a bowl cream the cream cheese, stir in the olives, the capers, the minced parsley, and salt and pepper to taste, and transfer the mixture to a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch plain tip. Transfer the radishes, hollowed sides down, to paper towels, let them drain for 5 minutes, and pipe the cream cheese mixture into them. Garnish each stuffed radish with a parsley sprig. The radishes may be stuffed 1 1/2 hours in advance and kept covered and chilled.

Cook wild rice in large saucepan of boiling salted water for 10 minutes. Drain well. Set aside.
Melt butter in heavy large pot over medium heat. Add leeks and sausage; sauté until leeks are soft, about 4 minutes. Add corn; sauté 1 minute. Add wild rice, white rice, thyme, parsley sprigs, 3/4 teaspoon salt and 4 1/2 cups broth; bring to simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, about 45 minutes. (Dressing can be made 1 day ahead. Transfer to baking pan; cool slightly. Chill uncovered until cold, then cover with foil and refrigerate. Add 1/2 cup broth or water, then cover and rewarm in 350°F oven until heated through, about 15 minutes.)
Transfer dressing to large bowl. Sprinkle with chopped parsley and serve.

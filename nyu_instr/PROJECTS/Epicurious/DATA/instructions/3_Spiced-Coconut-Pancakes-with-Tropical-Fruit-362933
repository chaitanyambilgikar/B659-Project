Preheat oven to 250°. Whisk first 6 ingredients and 3/4 teaspoon salt in large bowl. Whisk coconut milk, 1 1/4 cups warm water, 2 tablespoons maple syrup, and vanilla in medium bowl. Whisk coconut milk mixture into dry ingredients until batter is pourable.
Heat griddle or skillet over medium-high heat; brush with vegetable oil. Working in batches, add batter by 1/4 cupfuls. Working quickly and using back of spoon, spread each pancake to about 4-inch round. Cook until small bubbles appear on surface and bottoms of pancakes are golden, reducing heat if browning too quickly, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn over; cook until golden, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to baking sheet. Keep warm in oven.
Place 2 to 3 pancakes on each plate. Top with tropical fruit salad, maple syrup, and chopped pistachios.

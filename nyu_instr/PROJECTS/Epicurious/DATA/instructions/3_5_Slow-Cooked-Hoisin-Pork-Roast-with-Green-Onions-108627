Preheat oven to 300°F. Heat oil in heavy large ovenproof pot over high heat. Add pork shoulder, fat side down; brown on all sides, turning often, about 12 minutes. Remove pot from heat. Spread hoisin sauce over pork; sprinkle with green onion pieces and peppercorns. Cover pot and place in oven. Cook until pork is very tender when pierced with fork, about 2 3/4 hours, adding water to pot by 1/4 cupfuls if mixture is dry.
Remove pot from oven. Transfer pork to cutting board and tent with foil. Let pork stand 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, spoon off fat from pan juices. Stir whisky and 3/4 cup water into juices; boil 2 minutes. Add more water by tablespoonfuls if sauce is too thick, or boil to reduce sauce if too thin.
Cut pork crosswise on slight diagonal into 1-inch-thick slices. Garnish with sliced green onions. Pour pan sauce over pork and serve.

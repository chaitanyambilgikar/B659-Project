Stir coriander, cumin and turmeric in small skillet over medium heat until lightly toasted, about 3 minutes. Transfer to processor. Add red peppers, onion, chilies and garlic. Blend to form smooth paste. Mix in honey, lime juice and peel. With machine running, gradually blend in 1/4 cup oil. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to bowl. Cover; chill overnight.
Thread 1 shrimp and 1 pineapple cube onto each skewer. Brush with 3 tablespoons oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. (Can be made 8 hours ahead. Cover; chill.) Preheat broiler. Arrange skewers in single layer on 3 baking sheets. Working in batches, broil until shrimp are almost cooked through, turning once, about 2 minutes per side. Brush shrimp and pineapple with some red pepper sauce. Broil 1 minute longer.
Arrange skewers on platter. Sprinkle with green onions and sesame seeds. Serve with limes and remaining sauce.

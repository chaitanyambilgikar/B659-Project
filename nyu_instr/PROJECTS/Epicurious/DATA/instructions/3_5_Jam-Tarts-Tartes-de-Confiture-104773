Make dough: Blend together flour, butter, shortening, salt, and sugar in a bowl with your fingertips or a pastry blender (or pulse in a food processor) until most of mixture resembles coarse meal with the rest in small (roughly pea-size) lumps. Drizzle evenly with 3 tablespoons ice water and gently stir with a fork (or pulse in food processor) until incorporated.
Test dough by gently squeezing a small handful: When it has proper texture, it should hold together without crumbling apart. If necessary, add more ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, stirring (or pulsing) until just incorporated, and test again. (If you overwork mixture or add too much water, pastry will become tough.)
Turn out dough onto a lightly floured work surface and divide into 2 portions. With heel of your hand, smear each portion once in a forward motion to help distribute fat. Gather dough together and divide it into 6 portions, then form each portion into a disk. Chill, wrapped in plastic wrap, until firm, at least 1 hour.
Prepare shells: Roll each piece of dough into a 6-inch round with a rolling pin on a lightly floured surface and fit each into a tartlet pan. Roll rolling pin over tops of pans to trim dough flush with rims and lightly prick bottoms and sides all over with a fork. Chill 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375°F.
Line shells with foil and fill with pie weights or raw rice. Bake in middle of oven on a baking sheet until pastry is set and pale golden on edges, 15 minutes. Remove foil and weights and bake shells until pale golden all over, 6 to 10 minutes more. Cool in pans on a rack.
Make filling: Simmer jam in a small saucepan, stirring occasionally, 1 minute. Remove from heat and stir in lemon juice. Put raspberries in a large bowl and pour warm jam over berries, gently tossing with a rubber spatula to coat berries. Mound berries in tart shells.

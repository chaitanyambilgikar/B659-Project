Heat oven to 400°F. Coat a shallow roasting pan with cooking spray; cook potatoes (covered with foil) for 15 minutes. Uncover and roast until tender, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, bring carrots, onion and 1/2 cup water to a boil in a medium nonstick skillet. Reduce heat; simmer, covered, 5 minutes. Uncover; cook until water evaporates and vegetables are tender, about 3 minutes. In a food processor, process potatoes with remaining ingredients until smooth. Add just enough water to make a spreadable paste, about 1 cup. Add carrot mixture; pulse until blended. Serve at room temperature or chilled, with whole-wheat pita wedges.

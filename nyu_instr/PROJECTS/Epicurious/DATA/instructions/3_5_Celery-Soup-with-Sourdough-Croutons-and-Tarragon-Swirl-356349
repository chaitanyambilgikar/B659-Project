Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in large pot over medium-high heat. Add chopped green onions; sauté 2 minutes. Add sliced celery with leaves, low-salt chicken broth, whiteskinned potato pieces, and celery seeds; bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium; cover and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes.
Working in batches, puree soup in blender until smooth. Return puree to pot. Stir in 3 tablespoons whipping cream. Season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Heat remaining 2 teaspoons olive oil in small nonstick skillet over medium high heat. Add sourdough baguette cubes; sauté until brown and crisp, 3 to 4 minutes. Season croutons to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Mix 2 tablespoons plain nonfat yogurt and 1 teaspoon minced fresh tarragon in small bowl. Rewarm soup. Divide soup equally among 6 bowls. Drizzle each serving with tarragon yogurt sauce. Sprinkle each serving with sourdough croutons. Garnish with tarragon sprigs and serve immediately.

Add 1 1/2 cups cream; stir until dough forms, adding more cream by tablespoonfuls if dry. Transfer to a lightly floured surface; roll to 3/4" thickness. Using biscuit cutter, cut into rounds. Repeat until all dough is used.
Transfer biscuits to a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Brush tops with cream and transfer to oven. Bake until golden brown, 25-30 minutes. Serve warm with Tomato and Crawfish gravies .

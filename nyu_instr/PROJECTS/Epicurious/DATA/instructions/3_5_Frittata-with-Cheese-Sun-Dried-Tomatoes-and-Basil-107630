Preheat broiler. Whisk eggs and cream in large bowl to blend. Stir in feta cheese, tomatoes, onions, basil, salt, and pepper. Melt butter in large ovenproof nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add egg mixture; do not stir. Cook until eggs start to firm and sides and bottom begin to brown, lifting sides occasionally to let uncooked egg run underneath, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle with olives and Parmesan cheese. Transfer skillet to broiler and cook until eggs start to puff and brown, about 2 minutes. Using flexible spatula, loosen edges and bottom of frittata. Slide out onto plate. Slice frittata into wedges. Serve warm or at room temperature.

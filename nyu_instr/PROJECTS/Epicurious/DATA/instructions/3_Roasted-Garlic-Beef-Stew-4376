Preheat oven to 350°F. Toss garlic with 1 tablespoon melted butter on small baking sheet. Bake until garlic is tender and beginning to brown, about 15 minutes. Cool garlic 5 minutes. Peel and set aside.
Melt 3 tablespoons butter in large pot over high heat. Sprinkle beef with salt and pepper; dust with 1 tablespoon flour. Add beef to pot. Sauté until no longer pink, about 6 minutes. Transfer beef to bowl. Add vegetables, broth, wine, herbs and roasted garlic to pot. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low. Cover; simmer until vegetables are tender, about 25 minutes.
Return beef and any juices to pot. Mix remaining 1 tablespoon butter and 1 tablespoon flour in small bowl. Whisk flour paste into stew. Simmer uncovered until sauce thickens, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and serve.

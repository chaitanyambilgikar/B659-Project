Heat oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook shallots until translucent but not browned, about 5 minutes. Add vinegar, bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a high simmer. Cook until 2/3 of liquid has evaporated and shallots are very dark, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat. Combine sour cream, rosemary and 2 teaspoons water in a bowl. Spoon balsamic-shallot sauce into center of sour cream and swirl with a toothpick. Serve with Cheesy Sweet Potato Crisps .

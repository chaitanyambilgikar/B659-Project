In a kettle of boiling salted water blanch the cabbage for 2 minutes and drain it. In the kettle, cleaned, cook the onion, the bay leaf, the thyme, the allspice berries, the garlic, and salt and pepper to taste in the oil over moderately low heat, stirring, until the onion is softened, add the cabbage, the apple, the wine, 1/4 cup of the vinegar, the sugar, and 3/4 cup water, and bring the liquid to a boil. Simmer the mixture, covered, stirring occasionally, for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the cabbage is tender, discard the allspice berries, and add the currants. Simmer the mixture, uncovered, stirring occasionally, for 10 to 15 minutes more, or until most of the liquid has evaporated, discard the bay leaf and the garlic, and season the confit with salt and pepper and the additional vinegar. The confit may be made 2 days in advance, kept covered and chilled, and reheated just before serving.

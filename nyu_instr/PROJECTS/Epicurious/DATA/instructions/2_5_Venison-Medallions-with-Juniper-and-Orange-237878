Make butter: In food processor, combine all ingredients and pulse until well combined. Transfer to large sheet of wax paper and roll into 5-inch-long log. Wrap in wax paper and refrigerate at least 1 hour to allow flavors to develop.
Make venison: In large glass baking dish, whisk together olive oil, orange zest, sage, pepper, and juniper berries. Add venison medallions and turn to coat. Let stand at room temperature at least 1 hour, turning meat occasionally.
Over moderate heat, heat large heavy skillet until hot. Add 4 venison medallions and cook until undersides are well browned, about 3 minutes. Turn over and cook to desired doneness (thermometer inserted into center will register 120°F for medium-rare), about 2 to 3 minutes for medium-rare. Transfer to platter and cover loosely with foil. Repeat with remaining medallions, cooking 4 at a time. Slice log of butter into 8 coins. Divide medallions among 8 plates and top each serving with 1 coin. Serve immediately.

Preheat oven to 375°F. Place garlic on 6-inch square of foil; drizzle garlic with 1 teaspoon oil. Seal foil packet. Toss tomatoes, salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons oil in bowl. Arrange tomatoes, cut side up, on rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle any juices in bowl over tomatoes. Place garlic packet on same sheet. Bake until garlic is soft, about 50 minutes. Remove from oven; increase temperature to 400°F.
Meanwhile, line baking sheet with parchment paper. Roll out puff pastry on floured surface to 10-inch square; transfer to prepared sheet. Using fork, pierce pastry all over. Chill 20 minutes.
Sprinkle 3/4 cup cheese over pastry, leaving 1-inch plain border. Arrange tomatoes in alternating colors, cut side up, over cheese in 4 rows. Place garlic cloves between tomatoes. Sprinkle with thyme, rosemary, and 1/2 cup cheese. Bake tart until golden, about 25 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.

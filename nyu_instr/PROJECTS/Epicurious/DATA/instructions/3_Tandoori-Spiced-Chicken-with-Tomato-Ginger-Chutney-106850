For marinade: Whisk yogurt and next 9 ingredients in large bowl to blend. Add chicken and turn to coat. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
For chutney: Combine all ingredients in medium bowl. Season to taste with salt and pepper. (Chutney can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Brush grill with oil. Transfer marinade-coated chicken to barbecue grill. Grill chicken until cooked through, about 7 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to cutting board. Cut crosswise on diagonal into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Transfer to platter. Serve with chutney.

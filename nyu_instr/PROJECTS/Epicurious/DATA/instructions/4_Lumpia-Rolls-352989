1. Put the oil in a large skillet and turn the heat to medium. A minute later, add the garlic and shallots and cook, stirring occasionally, until fragrant, 15 to 30 seconds. Add the pork and cook, breaking up any lumps and stirring occasionally, until the meat loses its pinkness, about 3 minutes. Add the vegetables and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the salt, pepper, and wine and remove from the heat.
2. Lay a lumpia wrapper flat on a work surface and place a piece of the lettuce on top. Line 2 heaping tablespoons of stir-fry mixture on top of the lettuce. Fold in the sides and roll tightly, sealing the seam. If necessary, with a few drops of water spread with a brush or your fingertip. Serve with either or both of the sauces.

In a kettle combine the beans, the ham hock, the garlic, the bay leaf, the orégano, the onion, the bell peppers, the red pepper flakes, the chili powder, and 8 cups water and simmer the mixture, covered, stirring occasionally, for 3 hours, or until the beans are tender. Stir in the tomatoes and salt to taste and simmer the mixture, uncovered, stirring occasionally, for 1 hour, or until the mixture is thickened. Discard the bay leaf, remove the ham hock from the mixture, and chop the meat. Stir the meat into the mixture with the coriander and the vinegar and serve the beans over the rice with the radish or onion.
To quick-soak dried beans: In a colander rinse the beans under cold water and discard any discolored ones. In a kettle combine the beans with enough cold water to cover them by 2 inches, bring the water to a boil, and boil the beans for 2 minutes. Remove the kettle from the heat and let the beans soak, covered, for 1 hour.

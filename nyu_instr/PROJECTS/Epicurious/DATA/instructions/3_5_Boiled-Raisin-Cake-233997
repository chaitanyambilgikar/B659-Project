Gently boil coffee, raisins, currants, orange peel, sugars, nutmeg, and butter over moderate heat, uncovered, in a 3-quart heavy saucepan, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes. Cool mixture to room temperature, stirring occasionally, about 1 hour.
Put a small roasting pan filled halfway with hot water on rack in lowest position in oven (to provide moisture during baking). Put remaining oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350°F. Generously butter tube pan.
Whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl, then stir into raisin mixture until combined well. Spoon batter into tube pan and smooth top. Bake in middle of oven until a wooden pick or skewer inserted in center of cake comes out clean, about 1 1/2 hours.
Cool cake completely in pan on a rack, about 2 1/2 hours, then turn out onto a serving plate.

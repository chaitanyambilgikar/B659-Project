Place chiles directly over the burners of a gas stove. Roast over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until skin is charred and chiles soften, 10 to 15 minutes. (To roast in oven, cover a large cookie sheet with foil. Place chiles on sheet and broil, turning occasionally, until skin is charred and chiles soften, 12 to 17 minutes.) Remove from heat and cool. Remove peel and seeds. Slice thinly; set aside. Sprinkle shrimp with half the salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large pan over high heat. Cook shrimp, stirring occasionally, 2 to 3 minutes. Add garlic; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in chiles, red peppers, tomatoes, zest and lime juice. Cook until liquid reduces by half and shrimp are no longer translucent, 1 to 2 minutes. Add wine and reduce until slightly syrupy. Stir in pasta. Reduce heat to low and cover 1 minute. Top with cilantro and serve.

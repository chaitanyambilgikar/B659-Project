Combine 1 1/4 cups flour, sugar, baking powder and salt in medium bowl. Gradually mix in enough water to form moist but not wet dough. Turn out dough onto floured surface and knead until smooth, sprinkling with more flour or moistening with more water by teaspoonfuls if necessary, about 10 minutes. Wrap dough in plastic. Let rest at room temperature at least 30 minutes and up to 1 day.
Pour oil into heavy medium saucepan to depth of 1 inch and heat to 350°F. Roll out dough on lightly floured surface to 1/8-inch thickness. Cut into 1 1/2-inch squares.
Working in batches, fry dough until puffed and golden brown, turning occasionally, about 2 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer fritters to paper towels and drain.
Sift powdered sugar over fritters. Serve with more powdered sugar and honey, if desired.

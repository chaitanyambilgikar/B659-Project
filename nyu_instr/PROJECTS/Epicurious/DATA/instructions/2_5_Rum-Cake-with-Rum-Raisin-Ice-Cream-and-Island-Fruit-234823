For cake: Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter 9-inch-diameter springform pan with 3-inch-high sides. Whisk flour and baking powder in medium bowl. Beat butter, sugar, and salt in large bowl until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Mix 1 cup water and vanilla extract in measuring cup. Fold flour mixture into butter mixture in 3 additions alternately with water mixture in 2 additions. Transfer batter to prepared springform pan.
Bake cake until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 1 hour 10 minutes. Cool completely in pan on rack. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.)
For sauce: Combine first 7 ingredients in heavy medium saucepan. Stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves, about 3 minutes. Increase heat to medium-high. Boil without stirring until sauce is reduced to 1 1/2 cups, about 5 minutes. Cool slightly. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Let stand at room temperature. Rewarm slightly before continuing.)
Remove sides from cake pan. Slice cake. Place 1 wedge on each plate. Place scoop of ice cream alongside. Spoon chopped tropical fruit alongside. Drizzle cake with sauce. Sprinkle with chopped pecans and serve.

Pat neck, giblets, and wing tips dry, then cook with onion in butter in a large heavy saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until well browned, 15 to 20 minutes. Add broth, water, carrot, celery, and thyme and bring to a boil, then simmer, skimming any foam, until reduced by half, about 1 1/2 hours. Pour through a sieve into a bowl, reserving giblets (if using for gravy) and discarding remaining solids. (Reserve 1 cup stock for stuffing.)

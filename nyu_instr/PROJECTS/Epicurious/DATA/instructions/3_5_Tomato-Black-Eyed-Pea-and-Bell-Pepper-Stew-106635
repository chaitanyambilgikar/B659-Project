Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add bell peppers and onion; sauté until soft, about 5 minutes. Stir in chili powder; sauté 1 minute. Stir in tomatoes with juices, black-eyed peas, and broth. Bring to simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low; partially cover and simmer until peas are tender, about 35 minutes. Season stew to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cool slightly. Refrigerate uncovered until cold, then cover and refrigerate. Bring to simmer before serving.)
Divide stew among 6 bowls. Top each with 1/4 cup cheese and serve.

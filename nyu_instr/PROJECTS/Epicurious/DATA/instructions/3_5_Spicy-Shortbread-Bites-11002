Preheat oven to 350°F.
In a small bowl whisk together paprika, 2 teaspoons salt, and 1 teaspoon cayenne and set aside.
In a bowl with an electric mixer beat butter with sugar until light and fluffy. In another bowl whisk together remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, remaining 1/8 teaspoon cayenne, flour, curry powder, and cumin. Beat flour mixture flour mixture into butter until just combined.
On a lightly floured surface knead dough about 8 times, or until it just comes together. Divide dough into 4 equal pieces. On a sheet of wax paper roll each piece of dough into a 3/4-inch-thick log. Sprinkle one quarter of spice mixture along the length of each log and roll in mixture to coat completely.
Wrap each log in wax paper. Freeze dough just until firm, 15 to 20 minutes. Shortbread dough may be made 1 week ahead and frozen. Before proceeding with recipe, remove dough from freezer and let stand about 15 minutes, or until slightly softened to facilitate slicing.
Remove logs carefully from wax paper and slice into 1/2-inch-thick rounds. Place rounds 1/4 inch apart on ungreased baking sheets and bake in batches in middle of oven 15 minutes, or until browned lightly.
Gently loosen shortbread bites with a spatula from baking sheet (do not remove from sheet) and cool completely. Carefully transfer shortbread bites to a serving dish (they will be fragile) and serve as an hors d'oeuvre.

Toast bread on a baking sheet in oven until golden, about 5 minutes. In a bowl stir together remaining ingredients with salt and pepper to taste. Toasts and crab-meat mixture may be made 1 day in advance.
Reduce oven to 375°F. Spread crab-meat mixture on toasts and arrange on baking sheet. Canapés may be assembled 30 minutes in advance. Bake canapés in middle of oven until puffed, about 10 minutes.

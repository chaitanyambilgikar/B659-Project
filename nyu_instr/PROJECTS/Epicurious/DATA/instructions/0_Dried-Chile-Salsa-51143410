Toast chiles in a large heavy skillet over medium heat until slightly puffed and lightly darkened on both sides, about 2 minutes. Remove from pan; let cool. Add garlic to same skillet; cook, turning often, until skins brown in spots and cloves are soft, 10-15 minutes. Remove from pan. Let cool; peel.
Stem chiles and halve lengthwise; discard seeds. Cut into pieces; transfer to a medium bowl. Cover with boiling water; let soak, mixing often, until softened, 25-30 minutes.
Drain chiles, reserving soaking liquid. Transfer chiles, garlic, 1/2 cup soaking liquid, and 1 tablespoon vinegar to blender. Purée, adding soaking liquid as needed, until a smooth, thick sauce forms. Season with salt and more vinegar, if desired. DO AHEAD: Salsa can be made 1 week ahead. Cover; chill.

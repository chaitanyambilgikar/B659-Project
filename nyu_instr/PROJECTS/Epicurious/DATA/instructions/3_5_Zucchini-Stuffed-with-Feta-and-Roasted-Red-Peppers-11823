Preheat broiler.
Cut zucchini crosswise into 3/4-inch-thick sections, discarding ends, and with a melonballer scoop out center of each section, leaving 1/16-inch-thick shells and reserving centers for another use. In a steamer set over simmering water steam zucchini shells, covered, 4 minutes, or until barely tender but still bright green. Transfer shells to paper towels to drain upside down.
In a small bowl stir together roasted peppers, feta, oregano, and black pepper and mound in each shell. Arrange shells in a lightly oiled shallow flameproof baking dish and broil about 4 inches from heat until bubbling and beginning to turn golden, about 4 minutes.

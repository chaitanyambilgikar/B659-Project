Place the dried apples and cherries in a medium saucepan with water to cover by an inch. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Cover and reduce the heat to medium-low. Simmer until the apples and cherries are soft enough to puree, about 30 minutes.
Puree with a food processor or immersion blender and return to low heat. Transfer 1/4 cup of the puree to a separate bowl and whisk in the cornstarch until the mixture is smooth. Whisking constantly, pour the cornstarch mixture into the saucepan. Continue whisking until the mixture thickens, about 7 minutes. Turn off the heat and let the mixture cool to room temperature.
Stir in the buttermilk, cover, and chill thoroughly, at least 3 hours. Ladle the soup into 4 soup bowls and sprinkle each serving with lime juice.

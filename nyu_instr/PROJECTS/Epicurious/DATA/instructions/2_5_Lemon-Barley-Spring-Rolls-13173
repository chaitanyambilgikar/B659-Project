Make the filling: In a saucepan combine the barley, the water, and salt to taste, bring the water to a boil, and cook the barley, covered, over low heat for 40 minutes, or until the water is absorbed and barley is tender. In a skillet sauté the cabbage in the oil with the vinegar and salt to taste over moderately high heat for 4 to 5 minutes, or until it is wilted. In a bowl toss together the barley, the cabbage mixture, the carrot, the scallions, the zest, and salt and pepper to taste and let the filling cool. The filling may be made 1 day in advance and kept covered and chilled.
On a work surface arrange 1 spring-roll wrapper with a corner facing you and keep the remaining wrappers covered with plastic wrap. Spread about 1/2 cup of the filling horizontally across the center of the wrapper, leaving a 2-inch border at each end, and fold the corner closest to you tightly over the filling. Brush the edges with some of the paste, fold the left and right corners over the filling, and, rolling away from you, roll up the filling tightly in the wrapper. Make more spring rolls with the remaining wrappers, filling, and paste in the same manner, transferring them as they are made to a wax-paper-lined baking sheet and keeping them covered with plastic wrap. In a deep skillet or deep fryer heat 1 inch of the oil to 375°F. on a deep-fat thermometer and in it fry the spring rolls in 2 batches, turning them, for 2 to 3 minutes, or until they are golden, transferring them as they are fried with tongs to paper towels to drain. The spring rolls may be made 2 days in advance, cooled completely, wrapped in plastic wrap, and chilled. Reheat the rolls on a rack set in a jelly-roll pan in a preheated 450°F. oven, turning them once, for 10 to 15 minutes, or until they are crisp. Cut each spring roll on the diagonal into 3 pieces.

Peel potatoes and cut into 1-inch pieces. In a large saucepan cover potatoes with salted water by 2 inches and simmer until tender, 10 to 15 minutes.
While potatoes are simmering, cut tomatoes into thin strips. Drain potatoes in a colander and return to pan. With a potato masher mash potatoes with tomatoes, oil, and milk and season with salt and pepper.

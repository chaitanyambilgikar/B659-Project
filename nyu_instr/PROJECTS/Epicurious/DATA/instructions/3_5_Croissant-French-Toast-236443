Halve the croissants as if you were making sandwiches.
Whisk together the eggs, cream, whiskey, and cinnamon, and pour the mixture into a large shallow pan. Immerse the croissant halves in the liquid and let them soak for a few minutes, then flip them over and soak them for another minute.
Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook the croissants, a few at a time, until golden on both sides, adding more butter as necessary. As they're cooked, put the croissants in a shallow pan loosely tented with aluminum foil to keep them warm.

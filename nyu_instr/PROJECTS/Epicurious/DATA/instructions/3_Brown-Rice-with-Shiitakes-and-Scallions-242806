Soak shiitakes in 3 cups hot water until soft, as directed on package (at least 25 min­utes). Save soaking water. Strain soaking water through a fine-mesh sieve into a large saucepan; add rice, shiitakes, kombu (if desired), soy sauce and salt. Bring to a boil, stir and cover. Reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, until all liquid has evaporated and rice is tender, about 40 minutes. Turn off heat and allow to rest 10 minutes. Stir in scallions and serve immediately.

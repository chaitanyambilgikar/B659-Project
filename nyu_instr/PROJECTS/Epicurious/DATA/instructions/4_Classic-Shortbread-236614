1. Preheat the oven to 325°F. Place the sugar in a small bowl.
2. Cut the log into twenty 1/2-inch rounds. Dip one cut surface of each of the rounds into the sugar and arrange them 2 inches apart on all sides on a parchment-lined or nonstick cookie sheet or sheets.
3. Bake until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool the cookies on a wire rack.

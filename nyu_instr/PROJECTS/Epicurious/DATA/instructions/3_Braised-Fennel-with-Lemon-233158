Heat 2 tablespoons oil in large skillet over high heat. Add half of fennel; sauté until deep golden brown on all sides, about 8 minutes. Transfer to 11x7x2-inch glass baking dish. Repeat with 2 more tablespoons oil and remaining fennel.
Preheat oven to 400°F. Mix shallots and next 4 ingredients in medium bowl. Whisk in 3 tablespoons oil; drizzle mixture over fennel. Cover dish with foil and bake 30 minutes. Remove foil and bake until fennel is tender and shallots begin to brown, about 20 minutes longer.

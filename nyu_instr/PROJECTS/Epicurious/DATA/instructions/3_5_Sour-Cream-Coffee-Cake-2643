Preheat oven to 350°F. Grease 10-inch (12-cup) tube pan; dust with flour, tapping out excess. Mix first 3 ingredients in small bowl; set aside.
Sift flour, baking powder and baking soda into medium bowl. Using electric mixer, beat butter and 1 1/2 cups sugar in large bowl until fluffy. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating just until combined after each addition. Mix in sour cream and vanilla. Add flour mixture and stir until blended. Spoon half of batter into prepared pan. Sprinkle half of brown sugar mixture over and swirl gently into batter, using small knife. Spoon remaining batter over. Sprinkle remaining brown sugar mixture over.
Bake cake until tester inserted near center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool cake in pan 10 minutes. Cut around pan sides to loosen cake. Turn out cake onto rack and cool completely. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Wrap and store at room temperature.)

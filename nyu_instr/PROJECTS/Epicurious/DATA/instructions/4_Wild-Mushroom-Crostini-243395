For thyme vinaigrette: Blend first 4 ingredients in blender 10 seconds. With machine running, gradually add 1/2 cup olive oil; blend until almost smooth. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Preheat oven to 400°F. Arrange bread on rimmed baking sheet. Brush with oil. Bake until beginning to crisp, about 8 minutes.

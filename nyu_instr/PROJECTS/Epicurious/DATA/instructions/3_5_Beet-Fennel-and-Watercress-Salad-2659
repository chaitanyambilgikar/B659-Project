Preheat oven to 375°F. Cut tops and root ends off beets. Wrap beets in aluminum foil and bake until tender, about 50 minutes. Cool slightly. Peel beets. Slice beets into rounds; stack rounds and cut into strips.
Combine fresh lemon juice and honey in small bowl. Gradually mix in olive oil. Season dressing to taste with salt and pepper. (Dressing can be prepared 1 day ahead. Wrap beets tightly and refrigerate. Cover dressing and let stand at room temperature.)
Place watercress in bowl and toss with enough dressing to coat. Arrange on platter. Top with fennel and then beets. Drizzle remaining dressing over.

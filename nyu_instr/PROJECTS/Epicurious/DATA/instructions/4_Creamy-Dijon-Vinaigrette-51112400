Pulse 1/4 cup good-quality red or white wine vinegar, 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard, 1 tablespoon honey, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, and 1/2 garlic clove in a blender to combine. With motor running, slowly add 1/2 cup vegetable oil, then 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil. Season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper.

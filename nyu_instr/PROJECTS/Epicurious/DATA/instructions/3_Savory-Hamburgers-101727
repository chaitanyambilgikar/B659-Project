To each pound of ground beef add 1 medium onion chopped very fine, 1/2 cup of chopped ripe olives and 1 tablespoon of Spice Islands mushroom powder. Grill as with plain hamburgers , seasoning to taste with salt and pepper as the meat cooks.
Serve these hamburgers with crisp fried potatoes and a salad of sliced tomatoes dressed with olive oil and wine vinegar and garnished with black olives and strips of anchovies.

Preheat broiler.
Put bell peppers on rack of broiler pan about 5 inches from heat and broil, turning occasionally with tongs, until skins are blackened, about 15 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and let stand, covered, until cool enough to handle.
Peel peppers over bowl (to catch any liquid) and discard stems and seeds. Cut peppers lengthwise into 1-inch-thick strips and add to liquid in bowl with vinegar, thyme, and capers.
Add salt and pepper to taste and toss.
Divide arugula among 4 plates. Top with peppers and drizzle with any remaining dressing. Serve at room temperature or chilled.

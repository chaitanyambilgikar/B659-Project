Peel, core and thinly slice the apples. Put into a stainless steel or enamel pan with a little water. Cover and cook gently until soft, then purée. Stir in 1 tablespoon of butter and enough sugar to taste. Melt remaining butter in a frying pan, add breadcrumbs and sugar and stir until golden. Allow to cool.
Just before serving, arrange alternate layers of apple purée and crumbs in a serving dish or individual bowls. Finish with a sprinkling of crumbs, decorate with whipped cream and red currant jelly.

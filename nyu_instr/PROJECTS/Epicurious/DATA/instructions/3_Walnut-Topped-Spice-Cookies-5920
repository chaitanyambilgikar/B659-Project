Preheat oven to 325°F. Line baking sheet with foil. Beat first 7 ingredients in large bowl to blend. Mix in flour. Shape dough into walnut-size balls; arrange 1 inch apart on prepared sheet. Top each with 1 walnut half. Press walnuts to adhere to dough and to flatten balls slightly. Brush generously with glaze.
Bake cookies until cooked through and light brown, about 20 minutes. Cool on sheet. (Can be prepared 2 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.)

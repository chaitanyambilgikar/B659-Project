Remove zest from oranges with a vegetable peeler and trim any white pith from zest with a sharp paring knife. Bring zest, sugar, and waterto a boil in a 3-quart saucepan, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, until syrupy, about 6 minutes. Drain zest in a sieve and spread out on baking sheet.
Bake zest in middle of oven until dry and crisp, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool on baking sheet on a rack. Grind zest to a powder in electric coffee/spice grinder.

Prepare grill for direct-heat cooking with medium-hot charcoal.
Stir together all ingredients except pork chops in a bowl to form spice paste, then rub paste all over pork chops.
Oil grill rack, then grill chops over coals, turning over occasionally and moving around if flare-ups occur, until browned, 2 to 3 minutes total.
Move chops to area with no coals underneath, then cover with inverted roasting pan and grill, turning chops over once, until thermometer inserted horizontally into center of a chop (do not touch bone) registers 145°F, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a platter and let stand 5 minutes before serving.

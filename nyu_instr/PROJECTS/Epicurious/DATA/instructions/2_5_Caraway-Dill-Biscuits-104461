Preheat oven to 425°F. Mix flour and caraway seeds in large bowl. Make well in center of flour. Add milk, 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons oil and dill. Stir just until dry ingredients are evenly moistened. Gather dough into ball. Roll out dough on lightly floured surface to 3/4-inch thickness. Using 1 3/4-inch round cutter, cut out biscuits. Gather scraps and gently reroll dough on lightly floured surface. Cut out more biscuits. Arrange on 2 large baking sheets. Brush biscuit tops with remaining 2 tablespoons oil.
Bake biscuits until puffed and very pale golden on top and tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 15 minutes. (Can be prepared 6 hours ahead. Cool completely, then wrap airtight in plastic.) Serve warm or at room temperature.

Whisk 1 cup half and half, egg yolks, and cornstarch in medium bowl until smooth. Combine remaining 2 cups half and half, brown sugar, and salt in heavy medium saucepan. Bring just to boil, stirring until sugar dissolves. Gradually whisk hot half and half mixture into egg yolk mixture. Strain mixture back into same saucepan. Whisk over medium-low heat until mixture just boils and thickens, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat; whisk in butter, Scotch, and vanilla.
Divide pudding mixture among six 3/4-cup ramekins or custard cups. Cover ramekins with plastic wrap and refrigerate until cold, about 3 hours. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Keep refrigerated.
Beat whipping cream and powdered sugar in medium bowl until soft peaks form. Spoon large dollops of whipped cream atop pudings. Sprinkle with crushed toffee and serve.
GOOD TO KNOW: Crushing the toffee bar with a mallet while the bar is still in its wrapper helps keep the crushed pieces contained. W hisking the hot half and half into the egg yolks gradually—instead of all at once—keeps the mixture from curdling. And finally, straining the pudding mixture helps get the smoothest, silkiest result.
*Vanilla paste, made with vanilla bean seeds, packs big flavor. It can be found at Trader Joe's markets, specialty foods stores, and surfasonline.com.

Heat oil in large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add onion and bell pepper and sauté until tender, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and crushed red pepper; stir 1 minute. Add okra, 6 tablespoons water and tomatoes with juices. Bring to boil. Reduce heat, cover and simmer until okra is tender, stirring occasionally, about 6 minutes. Uncover and simmer until most of liquid evaporates and mixture thickens slightly, about 2 minutes. Stir in vinegar and capers. Season with salt and pepper. Cool to room temperature. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.)
Spoon about 2 tablespoons caponata onto each baguette slice and serve.

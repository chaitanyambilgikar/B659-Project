Cook potatoes in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender, about 22 minutes. Drain. Cool to lukewarm. Peel potatoes. Cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices and place in large bowl. Drizzle vinegar over; toss to coat. Cool completely.
Add celery, ham, mayonnaise and chopped tarragon to potatoes; toss gently. Season with salt and pepper. Garnish with tarragon sprigs, if desired.

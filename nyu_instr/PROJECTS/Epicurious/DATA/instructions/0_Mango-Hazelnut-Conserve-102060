Peel, pit and cut into 3/4" cubes enough mangoes to measure 6 cups. Peel and sliver the zest of the oranges. Discard the white pith and seeds and dice the pulp coarsely. Combine all the ingredients, except nuts, and cook in a large pot over high heat for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until a thermometer registers 220° or until the juice has thickened. (It will thicken more as it cools.) Remove from heat and stir nuts. Pour into hot, sterilized jars and seal.

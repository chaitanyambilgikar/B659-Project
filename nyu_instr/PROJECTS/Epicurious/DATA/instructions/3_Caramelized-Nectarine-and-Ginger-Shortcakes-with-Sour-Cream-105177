For biscuits: Preheat oven to 400°F. Line baking sheet with parchment paper. Combine first 5 ingredients in processor; blend 10 seconds. Add butter and blend until mixture resembles coarse meal. Whisk milk and egg in small bowl. Add milk mixture to processor; blend using 5 on/off turns. Add crystallized ginger. Using on/off turns, blend until dough just comes together. Turn dough out onto work surface; knead gently 5 turns. Shape dough into log; cut crosswise into 8 rounds. Pat each round to 1-inch thickness; place on prepared baking sheet.
Bake biscuits until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 15 minutes. Transfer to rack; cool at least 15 minutes and up to 2 hours.
For filling: Combine half of nectarines, 1/3 cup brown sugar and 1/2 tablespoon lemon juice in heavy large skillet. Cook over high heat until fruit is just tender and juices bubble thickly, stirring often, about 5 minutes. Transfer to bowl; repeat with remaining nectarines, sugar, and lemon juice. Set aside at least 30 minutes and up to 2 hours. for sour cream: Combine sour cream and sugar in bowl; whisk to blend.
Cut biscuits horizontally in half. Place 1 biscuit bottom in each of 8 bowls. Spoon filling and sour cream onto each; cover each with biscuit top.

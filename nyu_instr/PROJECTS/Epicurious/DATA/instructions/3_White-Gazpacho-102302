1. Lightly toast 5 slices of bread. Remove the crusts then set the bread aside to soften in 1 cup of water. Lightly toast the almonds in a small skillet over medium-low heat until golden, about 7 minutes. Transfer the almonds to a food processor add the garlic and pulse until the almonds are finely ground. Squeeze the bread as dry as possible and add it, and about one-third of the grapes to the almonds. Process until the mixture is smooth.
2. Transfer the bread mixture to a bowl and gradually beat in first the vinegar, then 1/2 cup of the oil. Beat in the remaining two cups of water then strain the gazpacho through a fine sieve, forcing as much of the bread mixture through as possible. Season the gazpacho with salt and a pinch of cayenne and refrigerate until the soup is well chilled, at least one hour.
3. Before serving cut the remaining 3 slices of bread into 1-inch cubes. Fry the croutons over medium heat in the remaining 1/4 cup of oil until crisp and golden. Drain on paper towels. Cut the remaining grapes in halves or quarters. Serve the gazpacho in chilled bowls topped with the grapes, cucumbers, and croutons.

Bring water to a boil with salt and butter in a 4-quart heavy saucepan, then add polenta in a thin stream, whisking. Cook polenta at a bare simmer, whisking with a long-handled whisk and turning down heat as needed to prevent spattering, 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in cheese. Serve sprinkled with black pepper.

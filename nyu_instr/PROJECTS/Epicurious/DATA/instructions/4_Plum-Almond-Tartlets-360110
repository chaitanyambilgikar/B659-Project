Preheat oven to 400°F. Line rimmed baking sheet with parchment. Unfold pastry; cut into 4 squares. Set on sheet; pierce all over with fork. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon almond paste over each square, leaving 1/2-inch border. Place plum wedges atop pastry, leaving 1/2-inch border. Cut 1/2-inch slits around edges of tartlets. Brush edges with egg; sprinkle with raw sugar and almonds.
Bring grated plums, jam, butter, sugar, and allspice to boil in small saucepan, stirring often. Brush 1/2 tablespoon plum sauce over plums on tartlets. Bake tartlets until golden, about 20 minutes. Serve with ice cream and remaining plum sauce.

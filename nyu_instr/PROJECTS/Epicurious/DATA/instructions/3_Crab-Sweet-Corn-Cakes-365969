Lightly mix the crab, green onions, chile and cilantro in a bowl and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Sift the flour and cornstarch into a separate bowl. Add 2/3 cup cold water and the eggs and whisk until smooth. Stir in the crab mixture and corn kernels. The mixture should have the consistency of heavy cream.
Set up the outdoor grill for direct-heat cooking over medium-high heat. Place a griddle, plancha or piastra suitable for use on an outdoor grill on the grill to preheat. Grease the griddle with some oil. Spoon small amounts of the batter onto the griddle and cook for 3 minutes on each side or until golden. Serve with crème fraîche, sweet chile sauce and lime wedges.

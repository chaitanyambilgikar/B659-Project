Continue cooking sugar, stirring with a fork, until melted and cook, without stirring, swirling pan, until a deep golden caramel. Remove pan from heat and add cream (caramel will bubble and steam). Return pan to heat and simmer, stirring, until caramel is dissolved. Add peanut butter and simmer, stirring, until smooth. Sauce may be made up to 1 week ahead and kept in an airtight container, chilled. Warm sauce before serving. Serve sauce over ice cream.

Make Glaze: Combine all glaze ingredients in a small heavy saucepan and bring to a boil, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Briskly simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes, or until thickened slightly. Remove from heat and keep warm.
Fry Chicken: Cut off chicken wing tips (save and freeze for stock), and halve chicken wings at joint. Put rice flour, salt, and pepper in a paper bag or large resealable plastic bag and shake to combine. Working in 4 batches, shake chicken in rice mixture to coat completely. Transfer each batch, as coated, to a large sieve set over a bowl and shake wings several times (be gentle) to knock off excess flour. Arrange each batch, without layering, on plates. Clean and dry sieve.
Heat 1 1/2 inches of oil in a wide 4- to 5-quart pot over medium-high heat until it registers 350°F. Working in 4 batches, fry wings, stirring and turning occasionally, for 5 minutes (adjust burner to keep oil as close to 350°F as possible while frying, and return oil to 350°F before adding each new batch). With a slotted spoon, transfer each batch of fried wings to the cleaned sieve, set over a bowl. Let wings drain in sieve while the next batch fries, then transfer to a baking sheet lined with paper towels. When the last batch of wings is fried and transferred, clean and dry sieve.
Reheat oil to 375°F and beginning with first batch, fry wings again, stirring and turning occasionally, until cooked through and golden, about 5 minutes. Transfer fried wings to sieve set over a bowl and drain while next batch fries, then transfer to baking sheet lined with fresh paper towels.
Brush wings with glaze on both sides while hot, and transfer to a platter.

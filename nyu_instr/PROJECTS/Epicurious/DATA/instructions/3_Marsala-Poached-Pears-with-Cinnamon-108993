Peel pears using a vegetable peeler; leave stems attached.
Pour Marsala into a medium pot with a cover. Add 2 cups water and 6 tablespoons cinnamon-sugar. Put pears in pot and bring to a boil. Lower heat to medium and cover pot. Cook until tender, stirring occasionally, about 45 minutes depending on firmness of pears.
Remove cover and let pears and liquid cool to room temperature. Remove pears with a slotted spoon and put them upright in a bowl. Bring liquid in pot to a boil and cook over medium-high heat until reduced to 1 1/2 cups. Pour over pears and refrigerate until cold.
Serve pears with their syrup. Sprinkle with remaining cinnamon-sugar.

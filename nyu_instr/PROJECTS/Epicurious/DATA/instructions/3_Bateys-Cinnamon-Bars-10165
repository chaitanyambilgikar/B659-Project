Preheat oven to 325°F. and grease a 15 1/2- by 10 1/2-inch jelly-roll pan.
In a bowl with an electric mixer beat butter and sugar until light and fluffy and beat in yolk. Add cinnamon and flour and beat until combined well. Spread dough evenly in pan. In a small bowl lightly beat white and brush dough with enough white to coat completely. Sprinkle pecans over top and gently press them into dough. Bake dough in middle of oven 25 minutes, or until golden brown. While confection is still warm, cut into bars, each about 2 1/2 by 1 1/2 inches, and cool completely in pan on rack.

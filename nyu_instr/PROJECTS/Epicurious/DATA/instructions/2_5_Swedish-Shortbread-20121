Cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy; beat in vanilla. Sift together cornstarch and flour and add to butter mixture. Mix or knead until smooth. On waxed paper, roll dough into a square 1/4" thick, then cut into 1 1/2" squares with pastry wheel or knife. Bake on buttered cookie sheets in a 350°F. oven about 10-12 minutes, or until golden.

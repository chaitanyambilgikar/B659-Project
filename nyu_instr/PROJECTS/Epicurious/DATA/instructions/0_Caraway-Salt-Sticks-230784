Knead oil and 1 1/2 teaspoons caraway seeds into dough in a large bowl until oil is absorbed, then divide dough into 16 pieces. Loosely cover with plastic wrap and let stand 30 minutes.
Put oven racks in upper and lower thirds of oven and preheat oven to 375°F.
Roll each piece of dough into a thin log as long as the width of your baking sheets. Divide logs between 2 ungreased baking sheets, then brush lightly with some of egg wash and sprinkle with salt and remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons caraway seeds. Bake breadsticks, switching position of sheets halfway through baking, until just golden, about 25 minutes.

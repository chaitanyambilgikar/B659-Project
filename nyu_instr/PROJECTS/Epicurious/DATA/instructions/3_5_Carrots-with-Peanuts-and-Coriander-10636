In a steamer set over boiling water steam the carrots, covered, for 8 minutes, or until they are just tender. In a skillet melt the butter over moderate heat and stir in the lemon juice, the honey, the peanuts, and salt and pepper to taste. Add the carrots and cook the mixture, stirring, for 1 minute, or until the carrots are coated well. Sprinkle the carrot mixture with the coriander.

If using the apples, process through a juicer into a large measuring cup (you should have about 3 cups). Place 2 1/2 cups of the apple juice and the sapotes, cherimoya, bananas, and vanilla in a blender and blend until smooth, adding the additional 1/2 cup apple juice if needed to create a soupy consistency. Pour into tall glasses and serve.

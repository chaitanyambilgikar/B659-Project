1. Cook the potatoes in boiling salted water until tender, 8 minutes. Drain and place in a large bowl with the beef.
2. Cook the bacon over medium heat to render the fat, 5 minutes. Add the onion and bell peppers; cook, stirring, for 5 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and add to the potatoes and roast beef, along with the nutmeg, salt, pepper, orange zest and 2 tablespoons of the parsley. Toss.
3. Discard all but 2 tablespoons of the fat from the skillet, then spread the hash mixture evenly in the skillet and weight it down with something heavy, like a smaller skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until golden brown on the bottom, about 5 minutes. Turn the hash over with a spatula and cook until golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Spoon the hash onto six plates; top each with a poached egg and sprinkle with the remaining 2 tablespoons of parsley. Serve immediately.

Whisk 1/2 cup oil, vinegar, olivada and garlic in small bowl to blend; season with salt and pepper. Place chicken in 8x8x2-inch dish; sprinkle with thyme. Pour 1/2 cup dressing over chicken; turn to coat. Whisk 2 tablespoons oil into remaining dressing in small bowl. Cover chicken and dressing separately; chill at least 4 and up to 6 hours, turning chicken occasionally.
Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Bring dressing to room temperature. Remove chicken from marinade; discard marinade. Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper. Grill until cooked through, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer to plate.
Combine greens, fennel, radicchio and onion in large bowl; toss with remaining dressing. Mound on 4 plates. Slice chicken breasts lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Arrange atop salads. Garnish with figs, if desired, and pine nuts.

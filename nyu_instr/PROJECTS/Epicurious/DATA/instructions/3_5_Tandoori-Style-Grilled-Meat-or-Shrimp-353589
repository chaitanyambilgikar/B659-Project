1 In a blender, puree the first 8 ingredients until they form a paste.
2 In a large bowl, toss your protein with the marinade. Chill for at least 4 hours or overnight.
3 When ready to cook, heat the grill and shake any excess marinade from the protein. Grill 9 minutes for chops, 6 to 8 minutes a side on a covered grill for chicken, or 4 minutes a side for shrimp. Serve.

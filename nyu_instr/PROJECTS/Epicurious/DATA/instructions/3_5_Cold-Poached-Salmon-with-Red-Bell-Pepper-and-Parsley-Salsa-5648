Bring 2 cups water, wine, 2 tablespoons onion, 2 tablespoons dill and 1 1/2 teaspoons garlic to boil in wide saucepan or skillet. Add potatoes. Reduce heat; cover and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer potatoes to bowl. Cool.
Add salmon steaks to poaching liquid in same saucepan. Cover and simmer over medium-low heat just until salmon is opaque in center, about 7 minutes. Using spatula, transfer salmon to plate and cool. Cut salmon steaks in half; remove skin and bones. Cut salmon into 1-inch pieces.

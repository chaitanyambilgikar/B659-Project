Heat the tortillas on the griddle or in whatever way you like to heat tortillas.
In a sauté pan over medium heat, combine the rice,soup, tomatoes, and jalapeño peppers.
Mush it all up together.
Meanwhile, cook the eggs sunny-side up.
To serve, put 1 handful of arugula in the bottom of two plates.
Put the tortillas side by side on top of the arugula, and the rice-beans mixture on top of the tortillas, dividing it evenly.
Carefully slide the sunnies on top of that, and serve.

Combine mayonnaise, lemon zest, juice and cayenne in a bowl; set aside. Cook bacon in a nonstick skillet over medium heat until crispy, about 6 to 8 minutes; remove skillet from heat and transfer bacon to a plate lined with paper towels. Drain. Pour off all fat and wipe skillet clean; add oil. Return skillet to stove and heat to medium high; add salmon. Cook until fillets are no longer translucent in the center, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Toast bread and spread 4 slices with mayonnaise mix. Place 1 lettuce leaf, 2 slices tomato, 1 fillet and 1 piece bacon on top of each; close; cut in half; serve.

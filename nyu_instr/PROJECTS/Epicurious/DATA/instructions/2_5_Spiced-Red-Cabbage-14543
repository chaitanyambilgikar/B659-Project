Quarter and core cabbage and cut into 1/4-inch-thick shreds. In a 7- to 8-quart heavy kettle cook cabbage in oil over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes. Stir in remaining ingredients and simmer, covered, stirring occasionally, until cabbage is tender, about 20 minutes. Discard cloves and, if desired, bay leaf and cinnamon stick. Season cabbage with salt and pepper. Cabbage may be made 3 days ahead and chilled, covered.

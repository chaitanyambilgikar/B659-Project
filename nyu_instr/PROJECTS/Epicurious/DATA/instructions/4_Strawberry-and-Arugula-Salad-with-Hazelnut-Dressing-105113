Preheat oven to 350°F.
Roast nuts in a shallow baking pan in middle of oven until golden, 10 to 15 minutes. Rub warm nuts in a kitchen towel to remove skins (don't worry if some skins don't come off). Cool nuts, then coarsely chop.
Whisk together vinegar, lemon juice, shallot, sugar, and salt and pepper to taste. Add oils in a slow stream, whisking until combined well.
Toss together arugula, strawberries, hazelnuts, and dressing. Divide salad among plates and dot with goat cheese.

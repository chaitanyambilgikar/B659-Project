In a bowl whisk together flour, baking powder, salt, and hazelnuts. In a metal bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water melt chocolate and butter, stirring occasionally. Stir in rum and cool. Whisk in eggs and stir in flour mixture. Chill dough, covered, 1 hour, or until firm enough to handle.
Halve dough and on a sheet of wax paper form each half into a 10-inch log, using paper as a guide. Chill logs, wrapped in wax paper, 4 hours, or until firm.
(After the dough has been formed into a log it can be kept in the refrigerator for one week or the freezer for one month. Thaw the frozen dough in the refrigerator until sliceable, about four hours.)
Preheat oven to 350° F. and lightly butter 2 baking sheets.
Cut logs into 1/2-inch-thick rounds and arrange about 1 inch apart on baking sheets. Bake cookies in batches in middle of oven 8 minutes and transfer to racks. Cool cookies completely and sprinkle with confectioners' sugar. Makes about 36 cookies.

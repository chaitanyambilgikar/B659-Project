Stir milk, sugar, tapioca, eggs, lime peel and salt in heavy medium saucepan to blend. Let stand 5 minutes. Stir over medium-high heat until mixture thickens and just comes to boil, about 10 minutes. Transfer pudding to large bowl. Lay plastic wrap directly on surface of pudding and cool to lukewarm. Mix in vanilla. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Stir to loosen before continuing.)
Preheat broiler. Divide mango among eight 3/4-cup ramekins or custard cups. Spoon pudding atop mango, dividing equally. Smooth tops with spatula. Sprinkle 2 teaspoons brown sugar evenly over each pudding. Let stand until sugar begins to melt, about 10 minutes. Broil until sugar bubbles all over, watching closely and turning frequently, about 4 minutes. Serve warm.

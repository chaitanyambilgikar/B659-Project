Heat the olive oil in a wide, heavy pot over medium heat, add the onions and garlic, and cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the parsley and tomatoes. Raise the heat and bring to a simmer. Add 1 cup water and the wine.
Cook, partially covered, for 10 minutes. Add the fish, cover, and simmer for 12 to 15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste and serve.

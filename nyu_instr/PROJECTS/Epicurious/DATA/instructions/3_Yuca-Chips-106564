Peel yuca with vegetable peeler, removing all waxy brown skin and pinkish layer underneath, then cut flesh crosswise into 3-inch sections.
Heat 1 1/2 inches oil in a 5-quart heavy pot over moderately high heat until it registers 375°F on thermometer.
While oil is heating, shave as many very thin lengthwise strips as possible from yuca sections with peeler or mandoline.
Fry yuca strips a handful at a time, stirring and turning with a slotted spoon, until golden, 30 to 45 seconds, transferring to paper towels to drain. Sprinkle immediately with kosher salt.

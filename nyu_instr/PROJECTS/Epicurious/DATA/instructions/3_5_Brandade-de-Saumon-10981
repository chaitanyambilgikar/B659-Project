In a saucepan of simmering water poach the salmon for 15 minutes, or until it is just cooked through, transfer it with a slotted spoon to a plate, and keep it warm, covered. In the water in the pan boil the potato, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces, with the garlic for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the potato is tender. While the potato and the garlic are cooking, in a small saucepan heat the oil, the cream, and the thyme over low heat until the mixture is hot, remove the pan from the heat, and keep the mixture warm, covered. Drain the potato and the garlic, return them to the pan, and cook them over high heat, shaking the pan, for 30 seconds, or until any excess liquids evaporated.
In a bowl with an electric mixer beat the potato and the garlic on medium-low speed until the mixture is smooth, add the salmon, and beat the mixture until it is combined well. Add the cream mixture gradually, beating, and add the lemon juice and salt and pepper to taste. Transfer the brandade to a bowl and serve it warm with the olives and the toasted bread. The brandade may be made 1 day in advance, kept covered and chilled, and reheated over low heat, stirring constantly.

Preheat oven to 300°F. Place six 1/2-cup ramekins or soufflé dishes in 13x9x2-inch metal baking pan. Combine 1/2 cup sugar and 1 tablespoon water in heavy medium saucepan. Stir over medium-low heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat and boil without stirring until syrup is deep amber color and just begins to smell slightly burnt, occasionally brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush and swirling pan, about 5 minutes. Slowly add cream (mixture will bubble vigorously); stir over low heat until any caramel bits dissolve and mixture is smooth. Remove from heat. Cool slightly.
Combine egg yolks, vanilla, and salt in medium metal bowl. Using electric mixer, beat until mixture is pale in color, about 3 minutes. Gradually add cream mixture and beat until blended. Divide mixture among ramekins (ramekins will not be full). Pour enough hot water into baking pan to come halfway up sides of ramekins. Bake until custards are just set, about 45 minutes. Remove ramekins from pan; cool slightly. Chill until cold, then cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.
Preheat broiler. Place ramekins on baking sheet. Sprinkle each custard with 1 teaspoon sugar. Broil until sugar melts and is golden brown, turning baking sheet as necessary and watching closely to avoid burning, about 3 minutes. Chill custards at least 30 minutes and up to 2 hours.

1. Preheat the oven to 450°F.
2. Make small slits in the meat with the tip of a small knife; insert the garlic slivers. Rub the meat with salt and pepper. Roast on a rack in a shallow pan for 25 minutes.
3. Reduce the oven temperature to 350°F and roast for 16 minutes per pound (about 1 3/4 hours), or until a meat thermometer reaches an internal temperature of 135°F to 140°F for a medium-rare center. Let rest for 15 minutes before carving.

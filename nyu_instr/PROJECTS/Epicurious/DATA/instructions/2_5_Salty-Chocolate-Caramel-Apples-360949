1. Insert a wooden Popsicle stick or chopstick into stem end of each apple. Cook caramels and chocolate in a double boiler over medium heat, stirring often, until melted, about 20 minutes. Place pretzels in a bowl. Dip bottom halves of apples into caramel mixture; twirl to coat. Roll bottoms in pretzels, place on serving plate lined with wax paper, and refrigerate until caramel coating is firm, about 20 minutes.

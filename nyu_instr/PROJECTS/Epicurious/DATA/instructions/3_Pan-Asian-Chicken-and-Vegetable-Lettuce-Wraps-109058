For dipping sauce: Stir sesame seeds in heavy small skillet over medium heat until golden, about 5 minutes. Place toasted sesame seeds in small bowl; cool. Mix in soy sauce, unseasoned rice vinegar, fresh lime juice, oriental sesame oil, and cayenne pepper.
For wraps: Mix soy sauce, mirin, and sake in small bowl to blend; set stir-fry sauce aside. (Dipping sauce and stir-fry sauce can be made 1 day ahead. Cover separately and refrigerate.)
Place chicken slices in medium bowl; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Add cornstarch and toss to coat. Heat 2 tablespoons oriental sesame oil in large deep nonstick skillet over high heat. Add chicken slices and sauté until cooked through, about 4 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer chicken slices to bowl. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oriental sesame oil in same nonstick skillet. Add sliced red onion, red bell pepper strips, and carrot strips; sauté 2 minutes. Add both cabbages and bean sprouts; sauté until vegetables are crisp-tender, about 2 minutes. Return chicken slices to skillet. Add stir-fry sauce and toss to coat. Season stir-fry mixture to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer mixture to strainer set over bowl to drain.
Arrange romaine lettuce leaves on serving platter. Divide stir-fry mixture among leaves. Sprinkle with chopped green onions and serve, passing dipping sauce separately.
*Unseasoned rice vinegar and mirin (sweet Japanese rice wine) are available at Japanese markets and in the Asian foods section of some supermarkets.

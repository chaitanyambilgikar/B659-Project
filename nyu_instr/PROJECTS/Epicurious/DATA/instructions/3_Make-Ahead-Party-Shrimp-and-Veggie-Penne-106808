1. Cook the shrimp in boiling water for 1 to 2 minutes, or until tender. Drain, rinse under cold water and place in a large bowl.
2. Add the bell peppers, tomatoes, basil, 2 tablespoons of the parsley, the shallots, salt, pepper, lemon juice, 1/3 cup of the olive oil, and the hot chili oil to the bowl. Gently toss with the shrimp, cover and refrigerate for up to 3 hours.
3. Before serving, bring a pot of water to a boil and blanch the broccoli.
4. Toss the broccoli and peas with the shrimp and set aside.
5. Just before serving, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the remaining tablespoon of oil and the penne. Cook at a rolling boil until just tender.
6. Drain the penne and toss immediately with the shrimp-and-vegetable sauce. Garnish with the remaining tablespoon of parsley.

Preheat oven to 325°F.
Mince garlic. Put lamb on a rack in a roasting pan and in small bowl stir together garlic, rosemary, mint, and oil. Rub mixture onto lamb and season with salt and pepper. Roast lamb in middle of oven 1 1/2 hours, or until a meat thermometer registers 145°F for medium-rare. Transfer lamb to a cutting board and let stand, covered loosely with foil, 10 minutes.
Make salsa while lamb is standing: Toast pine nuts in a dry skillet over moderate heat until golden. Seed cucumber and cut into 1/4-inch dice. In a bowl whisk together jelly, vinegar, and oil until jelly is broken up into tiny pieces and add remaining salsa ingredients, tossing. Season salsa with salt and pepper. (Do not make salsa ahead or it will become watery.)
Thinly slice lamb across grain and arrange on a platter. Top lamb with some salsa and serve remaining salsa on the side.

In a heavy saucepan cook the bacon over moderate heat, stirring, until it is crisp, add the onion, and the caraway seeds, and cook the mixture, stirring, until the onion is golden. Add the sauerkraut and the apple juice and simmer the mixture, covered, for 20 minutes.
While the sauerkraut mixture is the simmering, sprinkle both sides of the chops with salt, let the chops stand between layers of paper towel for 10 minutes, and season them with pepper. In a heavy skillet heat the oil over moderately high heat until it is hot but not smoking and in it sauté the chops for 5 to 6 minutes on each side, or until they are just cooked through. Stir 1 tablespoon of the dill into the sauerkraut mixture and transfer the mixture to a heated platter. Top the sauerkraut mixture with the chops and sprinkle the chops with the remaining 1 tablespoon dill.

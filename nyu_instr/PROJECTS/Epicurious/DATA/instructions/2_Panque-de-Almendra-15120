Preheat the oven to 350°F.
Butter and flour an 8 x 5-inch loaf pan or an 8-inch Bundt cake pan. In a large bowl, beat the egg yolks and sugar together until the mixture is thick and lemon-colored and falls from the beaters in a ribbon. Stir in the ground almonds.
Sift the starch and salt together. Beat into the almond mixture alternately with the milk, in three additions.
In a deep bowl, beat the egg whites to stiff peaks; fold into the almond batter. Spoon the batter into the prepared pan. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.

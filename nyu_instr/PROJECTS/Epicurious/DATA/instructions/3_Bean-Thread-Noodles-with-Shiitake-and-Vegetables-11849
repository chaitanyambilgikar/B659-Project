In a bowl soak noodles in warm water to cover 15 minutes. Drain noodles and cut into 3- to 4-inch lengths.
In a large heavy saucepan cook mushrooms, onion, and gingerroot in oil over moderate heat, stirring, until mushrooms are tender. Add broth, water, carrot, noodles, and salt to taste and simmer, stirring occasionally, until liquid is absorbed, about 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in scallions.

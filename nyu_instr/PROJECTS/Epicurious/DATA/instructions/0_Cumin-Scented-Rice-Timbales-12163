In a heavy saucepan cook the onion, 1 teaspoon of the cuminseed, and the red pepper flakes in the oil over moderately low heat, stirring, until the onion is softened, add the rice, and cook the mixture, stirring, for 1 minute. Stir in the broth, 1 cup water, and the salt, bring the liquid to a boil, and cook the mixture, covered, over low heat for 18 to 20 minutes, or until the liquid is absorbed. Fluff the rice with a fork, stir in the parsley, and let the rice stand, covered off the heat for 5 minutes. Pack the rice into 4 lightly coiled 3/4-cup timbale molds, unmold the timbales, and sprinkle the additional cuminseed on top of them.

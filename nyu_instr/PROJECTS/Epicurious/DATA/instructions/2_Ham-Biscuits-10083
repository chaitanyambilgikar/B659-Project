Preheat oven to 400°F.
In a bowl whisk together flour, baking powder, salt and sugar and with a fork or pastry blender blend in lard until mixture resembles course meal. Add milk, a little at a time, stirring until dough just pulls away from side of bowl.
Roll out dough 1/2 inch thick on a lightly floured surface. Cut out biscuits with a 1 1/2-inch round cutter and transfer to an ungreased baking sheet. Reroll scraps and cut out more biscuits in same manner.
Bake biscuits in middle of oven until pale golden, 10 to 15 minutes. Makes 20 silver dollar-size biscuits.
Split biscuits in half and spread lightly with mustard and horseradish. Put ham between biscuit halves.

Place turkey, paprika, 2 teaspoons salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper in large resealable plastic bag. Seal bag; shake. Heat oil in large pot over medium-high heat. Remove turkey from spice mixture (reserve spice mixture in bag). Add turkey to pot; cook 5 minutes. Place onions and potatoes in bag with spice mixture. Seal bag; shake to coat. Add vegetables to pot; cook 5 minutes, turning occasionally. Add broth, pumpkin, garlic, bay leaf, and thyme sprig; bring to boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer until potatoes begin to fall apart, about 1 hour.
Discard thyme sprig. Stir in 1 tablespoon chopped thyme. Season stew with salt and pepper. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 days ahead. Chill uncovered until cold, then cover and chill. Rewarm stew over medium heat before serving.
Cook noodles in large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally. Drain noodles; return to pot. Add butter and caraway seeds to noodles. Toss until butter melts. Divide noodles among bowls; top with stew. Sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoons chopped thyme. Serve, passing sour cream alongside.

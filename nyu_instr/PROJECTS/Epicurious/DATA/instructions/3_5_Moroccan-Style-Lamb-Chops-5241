Preheat oven to 500°F. Grind bread in processor to fine crumbs. Add garlic, orange peel, cumin and cayenne pepper. Drizzle in olive oil and blend until crumbs are evenly moistened. Transfer crumb mixture to plate. Sprinkle lamb chops with salt. Dip both sides of lamb chops into crumb mixture, pressing all crumbs into lamb. Arrange lamb chops on small baking sheet.
Bake lamb chops until crumb coating is golden and lamb is cooked to desired doneness, about 12 minutes for medium-rare. Serve immediately.

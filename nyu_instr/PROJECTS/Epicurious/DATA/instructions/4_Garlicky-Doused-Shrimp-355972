Shrimp Bring 3 quarts of water and a pinch of salt to a boil over high heat in the saucepan. Add the shrimp, lower the heat to medium, and simmer uncovered for 1 minute. Drain the shrimp and cool them to room temperature.
Marinade Combine the tomato, bell pepper, shallot, garlic, chopped basil, lemon juice, oil, salt, and black pepper in the bowl with a metal spoon. Add the cooled shrimp, toss well, and marinate in the refrigerator for 4 to 6 hours. (As the shrimp marinate, they get more garlicky.)
Drain the shrimp, reseason with additional salt and black pepper, and arrange them in a flat basket or on a black rectangular or round serving tray. Place the whole basil leaves in the center of the platter and serve with Ginger Yogurt Dip.
Ginger Yogurt Dip Combine the yogurt, lemon juice, ginger, and garlic in the bowl. Add the salt and pepper to taste. Whisk well until the mixture is smooth.
Place in a small bowl and serve with the Garlicky Doused Shrimp.

In small bowl, whisk together olive oil, lemon juice, vinegar, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Set vinaigrette aside.
Cut meat off each chicken breast to produce 6 skin-on, boneless breasts. Slice each breast lengthwise into 1-inch-wide fingers.
In small bowl, whisk together eggs and 1 tablespoon water. In second small bowl, whisk together flour, cayenne pepper, chile powder, garlic powder, remaining 2 tablespoons salt, and remaining 1 tablespoon pepper.
Preheat oven to 150°F. In heavy large pot, heat 3 1/2 inches oil until deep-fat thermometer registers 375°F.
Dip chicken fingers into eggs, letting excess drip off, then dredge in flour mixture. Working in batches, fry chicken until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer as done to paper towels. Grate 1/2 (about 4 ounces) frozen cheese over hot chicken. Keep warm in oven while frying remaining batches.
In large bowl, toss together lettuce, frisée, tomatoes, and onion. Drizzle with vinaigrette and toss to combine. Top with fried chicken fingers and sprinkle with remaining cheese. Serve immediately.

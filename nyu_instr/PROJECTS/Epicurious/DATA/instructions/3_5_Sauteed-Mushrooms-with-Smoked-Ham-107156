Place dried mushrooms in medium bowl; add enough boiling water to cover. Let stand until mushrooms soften, about 45 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer mushrooms to work surface; reserve mushroom soaking liquid. Chop mushrooms.
Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add button mushrooms. Sauté until mushrooms are brown and juices evaporate, about 12 minutes. Add porcini mushrooms; stir 1 minute. Transfer mushroom mixture to medium bowl.
Add remaining 2 tablespoons oil to same skillet over medium heat. Add shallots and next 3 ingredients. Sauté until shallots are tender, about 2 minutes. Add mushroom mixture and 1/2 cup mushroom soaking liquid, leaving behind any sediment. Cover and simmer until mushrooms are tender, stirring occasionally and adding more soaking liquid if mixture is dry, about 20 minutes. Add lemon juice; season with salt and pepper. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Rewarm over medium heat before serving.)
Transfer mushroom mixture to serving bowl. Garnish with parsley sprigs.
* Dried porcini mushrooms are available at Italian markets, specialty foods stores, and many supermarkets.

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease a 2- to 3-quart, 2- to 3-inch-deep earthenware casserole or baking dish with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil.
2. Slice the potatoes 1/4-inch thick and place in a large bowl. Toss with 1/2 cup of the bread crumbs and season well with salt and pepper. In a small bowl, mix the remaining 1 1/2 cups bread crumbs with the parsley, the remaining 1/4 cup olive oil, and the pecorino.
3. Spread a layer of potatoes in the bottom of the casserole and sprinkle with 3 to 4 tablespoons of the bread crumb and cheese mixture. Continue layering, finishing with the breadcrumb cheese mixture.
4. Bake for 1 hour, or until the potatoes are tender and the top is golden brown. Serve hot.

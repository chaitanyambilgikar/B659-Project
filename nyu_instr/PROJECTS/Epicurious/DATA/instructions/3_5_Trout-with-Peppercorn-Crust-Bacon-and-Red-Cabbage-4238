Open both trout and arrange, skin side down, on work surface. Sprinkle trout with salt, then peppercorns; press peppercorns to adhere.
Cook bacon in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat until brown and crisp. Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towels and drain. Add trout, skin side up, to drippings in skillet. Sauté until brown, about 3 minutes. Using large spatula, turn trout over. Sauté until cooked through, about 4 minutes longer. Transfer trout, skin side down, to plates. Add cabbage, onions and thyme to same skillet. Sauté until cabbage wilts, about 3 minutes. Add wine and bacon and simmer until cabbage is just tender, about 4 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.

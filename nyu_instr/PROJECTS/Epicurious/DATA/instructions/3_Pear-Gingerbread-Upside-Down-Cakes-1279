For topping: Butter six 1 1/4-cup custard cups. Place on baking sheet. Melt 6 tablespoons butter in medium saucepan over low heat. Add 3/4 cup brown sugar; whisk to blend (mixture will look grainy). Divide among prepared cups. Slice each pear half into 1/3-inch-thick wedges. Cut wedges crosswise in half. Place 6 pointed pear pieces in spoke pattern in each cup. Finely chop enough of remaining pear pieces to measure 3/4 cup.
For cakes: Preheat oven to 350°F. Sift flour, baking soda, ground ginger, cinnamon, cloves and salt into medium bowl. Melt 1/2 cup butter in small saucepan over low heat. Transfer to large bowl; cool slightly. Add 1/2 cup brown sugar. Using electric mixer, beat until well blended. Gradually beat in molasses. Mix in egg. Add dry ingredients; beat until well blended. Beat in hot water. Add crystallized ginger and chopped pears; stir until incorporated.
Spoon batter over pears in custard cups. Place in oven on baking sheet. Bake until cakes feel firm to touch and tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Transfer to rack; cool 5 minutes. Invert onto plates. Let stand 10 minutes. Serve warm.

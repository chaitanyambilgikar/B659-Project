1. Line a large tray or baking sheet with wax paper. In a large bowl, combine the confectioners' sugar, peanut butter, and butter, stirring until well blended. Shape into one-inch balls.
2. With a toothpick, dip each ball into the dipping chocolate until almost covered, leaving some of the peanut butter mixture exposed on top. Place the balls on the tray and refrigerate until firm, about two hours.

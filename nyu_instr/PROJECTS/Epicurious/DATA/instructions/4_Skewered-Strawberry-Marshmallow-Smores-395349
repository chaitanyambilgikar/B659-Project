Prepare a medium-hot fire on one side of your grill.
Thread the strawberries and marshmallows alternately on 4 skewers (if using wooden skewers, pre-soak them). Lightly brush the slices of bread with olive oil.
Place the skewers directly over the fire and grill for about 4 or 5 minutes until the marshmallows have browned.
At the same time, grill one side of the bread. Turn the slices over and move to the indirect side of the grill. Place a piece of chocolate on each slice and sprinkle with a pinch of coarse salt. Remove from the grill when the chocolate is soft but still holds its shape.
Serve the skewers with the grilled bread for a grown-up version of s'mores.

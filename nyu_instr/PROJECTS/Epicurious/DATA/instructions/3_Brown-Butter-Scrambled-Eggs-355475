Beat eggs with 1 tablespoon chives and 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and pepper in a bowl with a fork until well blended.
Heat butter in a 10-inch heavy skillet over medium heat until milk solids on bottom are a dark chocolate brown. Reduce heat to medium-low, then add eggs and cook, whisking constantly, until thickened to consistency of soft porridge with small curds. Spoon over toast and sprinkle with remaining tablespoon chives.

In a small saucepan combine the garlic and the butter, heat the mixture over moderately low heat until the butter is melted, and let it stand off the heat for 5 minutes. Strain the mixture through a sieve into a large bowl, pressing on the garlic, add the chicken wings to the bowl, and toss them to coat them well. Broil the wings on the rack of a broiler pan under a preheated boiler about 4 inches from the heat, turning them, for 20 minutes, or until they are golden. In a large bowl stir together the cinnamon, the cardamom, the cloves, and salt and pepper to taste, add the wings, and toss them with the mixture until they are coated well. Return the wings to the broiler rack and broil them, turning them, for 1 minute.

Bring 1 cup water to simmer in small saucepan. Remove from heat. Add tea bag and steep 5 minutes. Remove tea bag and squeeze to release excess liquid. Add all raisins to liquid. Let stand 30 minutes. Pour into strainer; reserve raisins.
Combine sugar and 5 tablespoons water in heavy medium saucepan. Stir over low heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat; boil without stirring until deep amber color, brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush and swirling pan occasionally, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat. Gradually whisk in cream and butter. Stir over low heat until caramel is smooth. Mix in raisins, nuts and ginger. (Can be made 1 week ahead. Cover and chill. Rewarm over low heat before serving.)

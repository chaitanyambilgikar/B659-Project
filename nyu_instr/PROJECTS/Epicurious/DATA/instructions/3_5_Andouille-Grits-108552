Melt 1 tablespoon butter in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add sausage and sauté until brown, about 3 minutes. Add 3 3/4 cups broth and bring to boil. Gradually whisk in grits. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until mixture is thick, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes. Mix in more broth by 1/4 cupfuls to thin, if desired. Stir in remaining 3 tablespoons butter. Season grits to taste with salt and pepper and serve.

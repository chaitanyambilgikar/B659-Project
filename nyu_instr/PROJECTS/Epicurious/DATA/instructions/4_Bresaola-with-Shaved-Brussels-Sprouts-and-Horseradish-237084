Whisk oil, vinegar, and shallot in small bowl. Season dressing with salt and pepper. Using mandoline or V-slicer, thinly slice brussels sprouts. Place 4 cups shaved brussels sprouts in large bowl. Add dressing; toss to coat. Season with salt and pepper.
Arrange 3 bresaola slices over each of 4 plates. Divide brussels sprout salad among plates, mounding in center so bresaola is visible. Sprinkle horseradish over brussels sprout salad and serve.

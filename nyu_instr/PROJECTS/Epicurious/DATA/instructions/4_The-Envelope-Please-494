Preheat oven to 350°F. Toss turnips with 2 tablespoons oil on large baking sheet to coat well. Bake 10 minutes. Add squash, sweet potatoes, garlic and thyme to turnips and toss to coat with oil. Season mixture with salt and pepper. Bake until vegetables are tender, turning occasionally with large spatula, about 25 minutes. Transfer vegetables to medium bowl.
Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions. Cover pan and cook until onions are golden brown, stirring often, about 15 minutes. Add onions to vegetables. Mix in parsley, maple syrup and ginger. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Cool completely.
Stir 1/2 cup oil and butter in small bowl to blend. Lightly brush 2 heavy large baking sheets with oil mixture. Place 1 phyllo sheet on work surface with 1 short end at bottom (keep remaining phyllo covered with plastic wrap and damp kitchen towel). Lightly brush phyllo sheet with oil mixture; place generous 1/3 cup filling 1 inch from bottom in middle of sheet. Fold right long side over filling, then fold left long side over, forming rectangle about 4 inches wide by 18 inches long. Brush lightly with oil mixture. Using spatula as aid, lift section with filling and fold over snugly so that filling section lies atop next 4 inches of pastry strip. Brush lightly with oil mixture. Continue to fold filling section over until end of phyllo strip is reached, forming 4- to 5-inch square envelope. Brush lightly with oil mixture. Repeat with remaining phyllo sheets and filling, forming 12 envelopes. Arrange 6 envelopes on each prepared baking sheet. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover tightly and chill.)
Preheat oven to 425°F. Bake envelopes uncovered until golden crisp, about 20 minutes. Transfer to platter.

In large pot, combine ground beef, split peas, onions, garlic, ginger, black and green cardamom pods, cinnamon sticks, cloves, chiles, salt, and 1 cup water. Bring to boil, then lower heat to moderate and simmer, uncovered, until meat is brown and mixture is very dry, about 30 minutes. (Be sure that all water has evaporated.) Remove from heat and cool.
When cool enough to handle, transfer mixture, including whole spices and chiles, to food processor. Grind until smooth and soft — texture should be finer than for hamburgers, but not so fine that it becomes extremely sticky. In large bowl, using hands, mix together ground meat, egg, and cilantro. Pressing firmly, form mixture into patties about 2 inches wide and 1/2 inch thick.
In large, heavy skillet over moderate heat, heat oil until hot but not smoking. Working in batches of 4 to 6, fry patties until browned, about 2 to 3 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels and serve hot.

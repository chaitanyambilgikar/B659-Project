For Custard: Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 325°F. Place six 1/2 cup ramekins or custard cups in baking pan. Stir 2/3 cup sugar and 3 tablespoons water in heavy small saucepan over low heat until sugar dissolves. Wash down sugar crystals from sides of pan with brush dipped into cold water. Increase heat to medium-high and bring mixture to boil. Boil without stirring until mixture turns deep golden brown, swirling pan occasionally, about 9 minutes. Immediately divide caramel among ramekins. Carefully tilt ramekins to coat bottoms (not sides) with caramel.
Bring cream, milk and 1/4 cup sugar to boil in heavy medium saucepan, whisking until sugar dissolves. Remove from heat. Add chocolate and stir until chocolate melts and mixture is smooth. Whisk in instant coffee, yolks, and egg.
Divide custard mixture evenly among caramel-lined ramekins. Add enough hot water to baking pan to come halfway up sides of ramekins. Bake until custards are set around edges and centers move only slightly when baking pan is shaken, about 30 minutes.
Remove custards from water and cool completely. Refrigerate until very cold, about 4 hours. (Custards can be prepared 1 day ahead.)
For Ganache: Dissolve instant coffee in 1/2 teaspoon water in small bowl. Combine chocolate and cream in heavy small saucepan. Stir over low heat until chocolate melts and mixture is smooth. Remove from heat and stir in coffee mixture. Cool until just warm to touch.
Divide ganache among custards. Spread ganache with back of spoon to cover top of custards completely. Refrigerate until ganache is set, at least 30 minutes. (Can be prepared 3 days ahead; cover.)
Run small sharp knife around edge of custards to loosen. Invert custards onto plates and serve.

Stir 1/2 tablespoon melted butter, honey, lemon juice, garlic, thyme, ground chiles, cumin, cinnamon, and pinch of cayenne pepper in small bowl to blend. Season to taste with salt. Let glaze stand at least 45 minutes to allow flavors to blend. Do AHEAD: Can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.
Preheat oven to 400°F. Line large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Spread parsnips, turnips, and rutabagas evenly on prepared baking sheet. Drizzle remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons melted butter and olive oil over; sprinkle with salt and pepper and toss to coat well. Roast until vegetables are soft and browned in spots, tossing occasionally, about 50 minutes.
Pour glaze over vegetables; toss to coat evenly. Roast until glaze is absorbed and vegetables are browned, tossing occasionally, about 15 minutes longer. Serve warm.

Put a baking sheet in middle of oven and preheat oven to 450°F.
Arrange sweet potato slices in 1 layer on hot baking sheet and roast until tender and lightly browned, 20 to 25 minutes. Divide between 2 plates and keep warm, loosely covered with foil.
While sweet potato roasts, cut salmon and scallops into 3/4-inch pieces, then toss with 1 tablespoon lime juice and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.
Cook onion in oil in a 10-inch heavy skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until pale golden, about 3 minutes. Add celery and chile and cook, stirring occasionally, until celery just begins to soften, about 2 minutes.
Add cream and bring just to a boil, then add seafood (with juice) and simmer until just cooked through and cream is slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Stir in remaining 2 tablespoon lime juice and 1/4 teaspoon salt.
Spoon seafood mixture on top of sweet potatoes. Sprinkle with cilantro.

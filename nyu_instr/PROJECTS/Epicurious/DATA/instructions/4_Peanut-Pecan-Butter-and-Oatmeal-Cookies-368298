Combine peanut butter and pecans in a food processor and purée until almost smooth. Whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt in a small bowl.
Using an electric mixer, beat both sugars and butter in a large bowl until fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add peanut butter mixture and vanilla; beat to blend well. Beat in egg. Add dry ingredients and mix until well combined. Add both oats. Continue to blend at high speed for 1 minute. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 3 hours.
Arrange racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 375°. Line 2 baking sheets with foil. Scoop rounded balls of dough (2 teaspoons each) onto cookie sheets, spacing 1" apart. Bake until light golden, 10–12 minutes (rotate baking sheets 180 degrees halfway through baking).
Let cookies cool on sheets for 2 minutes. Transfer to wire racks to cool completely.

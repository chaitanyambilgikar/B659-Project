Make bouquet garni: Wrap bouquet garni ingredients in cheesecloth and tie with kitchen string.
Make soup: Bring water and bouquet garni to a boil in a 1 1/2-quart heavy saucepan.
Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat until hot but not smoking and cook bread slices, turning over once, until golden, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer bread to 6 soup bowls. Add remaining 3 tablespoons oil to skillet and cook onion over moderate heat, stirring frequently, until softened, 4 to 5 minutes. Peel potatoes, then cut crosswise into 1/3-inch-thick slices. Add potatoes to onion and cook, turning occasionally, until onion is translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add garlic, peas, salt, pepper, and hot water with bouquet garni and simmer, covered, until potatoes are tender, about 7 minutes. Discard bouquet garni.
Break eggs into simmering soup and poach, uncovered, spooning broth over eggs occasionally, until softly set, about 6 minutes. Transfer eggs with a slotted spoon to toasts and divide soup among soup bowls.

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Position an oven rack in the bottom third of the oven. Line an 8-inch square baking pan with foil, shiny side up. Lightly grease the foil with melted butter or nonstick cooking spray. Set the pan aside.
2. Place 1/2 cup butter and the chocolate in a medium-sized, heavy-bottom saucepan; warm over very low heat, stirring until the mixture is melted and smooth. Remove the pan from the heat and allow the chocolate mixture to cool for about 3 minutes. Stir in the sugar and vanilla, then add the eggs, one at a time, mixing thoroughly after each addition. Add the flour and salt and stir until just incorporated. Stir in the walnuts. Pour the batter evenly into the lined pan.
3. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until a wooden toothpick inserted into the center of the brownies comes out clean but not dry. It's better to err on the side of underbaking, rather than overbaking.
4. Place the pan on a rack and allow it to rest until it is cool to the touch. Carefully lift the foil-wrapped brownies out of the pan and onto a cutting board. Cool completely. Using a thin, sharp knife, cut into 16 squares.
5. Store brownies in the pan in which they were baked or individually wrapped in a cookie jar.

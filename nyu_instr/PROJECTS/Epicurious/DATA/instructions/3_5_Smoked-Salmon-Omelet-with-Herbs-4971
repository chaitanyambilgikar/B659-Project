Whisk sour cream and mustard in small bowl to blend. Whisk eggs, 2 tablespoons water, chives and tarragon in medium bowl to blend. Season egg mixture with salt and pepper.
Melt 1 teaspoon butter in small nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add half of egg mixture and stir briefly. Let eggs begin to set at edges. Using spatula, lift edges and tilt pan, allowing uncooked portion to flow underneath. Cook until eggs are set but still moist, about 1 minute. Spread half of mustard mixture and half of salmon over half of omelet. Using spatula, fold unfilled portion over filling. Slide omelet out onto plate. Repeat with remaining butter, egg mixture and fillings to make second omelet.

Combine the cornmeal and salt in a mixing bowl. Add the cold water and stir until smooth. Stir in the milk, adding more if needed to achieve a thin, pourable batter.
Lightly oil the griddle. Stir the batter — it tends to settle — then spoon out 1 tablespoon of the batter for each cake onto the griddle. The batter should "dance" out into a thin disk. If it seems too thin, add 1 teaspoon of cornmeal to the batter. If the cake sits too high, thin out the batter with a little milk.
Let the cakes bake on the griddle until the underside is deep brown, about 5 minutes. Miller Tim McTague says "You wait and then wait some more."
Flip them with a metal spatula, being careful, as they are fragile and tend to stick, and fry the second side just until spotted brown, about 1 minute.
Serve them immediately. Lightly oil the griddle and stir the batter between batches.

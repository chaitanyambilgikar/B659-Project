Heat oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion, bell pepper, and carrots; sauté until softened, about 8 minutes. Add garlic; stir 1 minute. Add beans, fennel bulb, parsnips, and broth; bring to simmer. Cover and cook until vegetables are tender, about 8 minutes. Remove from heat. Add broccoli florets; cover and let stand 2 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Meanwhile, cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite. Reserve 1/2 cup pasta cooking water. Drain pasta; return to pot. Mix in vegetables, fennel fronds, cheese, and enough reserved pasta cooking water to moisten.
Season with salt and pepper.

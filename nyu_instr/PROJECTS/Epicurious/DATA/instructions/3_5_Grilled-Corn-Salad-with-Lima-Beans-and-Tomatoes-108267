Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Whisk 1/2 cup oil, vinegar, and shallot in small bowl. Set dressing aside. Brush corn with remaining 1/4 cup oil; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill until tender and beginning to char in spots, turning often, about 10 minutes. Cool slightly. Cut corn from cobs. Transfer to large bowl. Cook lima beans in boiling salted water until just tender, about 4 minutes. Drain. Rinse with cold water; drain. Mix lima beans into corn. Mix watercress and tomatoes into corn mixture. Add dressing and toss to coat. Season salad with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with cheese; garnish with olives. Serve, passing roasted pepper sauce.

Blend the 4 tablespoons butter and 1/2 cup of the sugar in a heavy pie tin and cook over medium heat until the mixture is thick, syrupy and lightly browned. Slice the peeled apples. Arrange them on top of the butter-sugar syrup in layers. Dot each layer with butter and sprinkle with a little sugar. Build the apple slices up in the center to come above the rim of the pan. Cover with rich pastry rolled 1/8" thick. Brush with egg. Bake in a 450°F. oven for 10 minutes. Reduce the heat to 375°F. and continue cooking until the apples are soft and the crust cooked through.
Let the tart cool slightly and then carefully invert it onto a serving plate. The apples should have caramelized with the sugar-butter mixture, making a delicate brown top for the tart. Serve warm or cold with cream.

Cut peel and white pith off oranges and grapefruit. Using small knife and working over heavy small saucepan to catch juice, cut between membranes of fruit to release segments. Using slotted spoon, transfer segments to work surface and chop. Transfer segments to bowl. Scrape juice from work surface into saucepan. Squeeze any remaining jucie from citrus membranes into saucepan. Whisk curry powder into juice. Boil until reduced to 1/4 cups, about 10 minutes. Cool.
Add avocado, onion and chives to citrus segments. Drizzle with oil and 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon reduced juice (reserve remaining juice for another use). Season with salt and white pepper. Toss gently; serve immediately.

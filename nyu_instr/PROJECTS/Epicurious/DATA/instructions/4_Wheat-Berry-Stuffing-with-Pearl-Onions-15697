Preheat oven to 350°F. Cut bread into 1/2-inch pieces and in a large shallow baking pan toast in one layer in middle of oven until just dry, about 15 minutes. Croutons may be made 1 day ahead and kept, covered, at room temperature.
In a 4-quart kettle three fourths full of boiling water (do not salt water) cook wheat berries, uncovered, until tender, about 1 hour, and drain in a large sieve. Transfer wheat berries to a large shallow baking dish.
While wheat berries are cooking, in a large saucepan of boiling water blanch onions 3 minutes. Drain onions and when cool enough to handle, peel. In a large skillet melt butter over moderately high heat and sauté onions, stirring occasionally, until golden, 15 to 20 minutes. Chop parsley and add with onions to wheat berries. Wheat-berry mixture may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered. Bring mixture to room temperature before proceeding.
Add croutons and broth to wheat-berry mixture and toss to combine well. Bake stuffing in middle of oven, uncovered, 30 minutes, or until top is slightly crisp.

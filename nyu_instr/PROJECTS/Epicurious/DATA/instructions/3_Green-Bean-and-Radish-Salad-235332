Cook green beans in large pot of boiling salted water until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Add radishes and cook 30 seconds longer. Drain beans and radishes. Rinse with cold water; drain well. Combine all ingredients in large bowl and toss to coat. Let marinate 1 hour at room temperature, tossing occasionally. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve.

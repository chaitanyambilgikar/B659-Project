Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook garlic, stirring, for 30 seconds; add bulgur and salt; stir 1 minute more. Gradually stir in 2 cups boiling water, 1/2 cup at a time (waiting until bulgur absorbs it to add more), until bulgur is slightly soupy, 8 to 10 minutes. (You might not use all the water.) Add shrimp. Cook, stirring constantly, until it turns pink, 2 to 3 minutes. Add corn, bell pepper, juice from 1 lime and red pepper flakes; stir, adding water to keep mixture creamy. Cook, stirring, until corn and pepper are warmed through, 1 to 2 minutes. Add cilantro; serve with lime wedges.

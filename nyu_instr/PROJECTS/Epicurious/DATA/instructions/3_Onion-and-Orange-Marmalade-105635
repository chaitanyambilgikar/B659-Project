Preheat oven to 400°F.
Heat oil in a deep 12-inch heavy ovenproof skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then sauté onions with bay leaves and clove, stirring frequently, until soft and beginning to brown, 25 to 30 minutes.
While onions are sautéing, cook sugar and oranges in a 10-inch nonstick skillet over moderate heat, stirring frequently, until sugar is melted and oranges are caramelized, 25 to 30 minutes.
Add stock and vinegar to onions and bring to a boil, then carefully stir in oranges (mixture will bubble up and steam vigorously). Boil, stirring, until caramel is dissolved, about 3 minutes.
Carefully transfer skillet to oven and bake, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until most of liquid is evaporated, 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 hours. Serve warm.

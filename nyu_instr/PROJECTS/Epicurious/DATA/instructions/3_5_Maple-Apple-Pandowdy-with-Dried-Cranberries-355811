For filling: Position rack in bottom third of oven; preheat to 350°F. Mix first 5 ingredients in 13x9x2-inch oval baking dish. Dot butter over apple mixture.
For crust: Place crust atop filling. Fold dough edges under; crimp decoratively. Using small knife, cut eight 1-inch squares in crust, spacing apart and cutting through crust but leaving squares in place.
Bake until crust is dry but still pale, about 35 minutes. Increase temperature to 400°F. Sprinkle crust with 1 tablespoon sugar; continue to bake until apples are tender, crust is golden, and juices bubble, about 35 minutes (mixture will be syrupy). DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 days ahead. Cool, cover, and chill. Rewarm uncovered in 300°F oven 20 minutes. Cool 15 to 20 minutes. Serve warm with ice cream.

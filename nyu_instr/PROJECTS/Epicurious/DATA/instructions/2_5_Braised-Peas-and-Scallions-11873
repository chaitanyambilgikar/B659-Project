In a saucepan melt the butter over moderate heat, add the sugar, the scallions, the peas, and salt and pepper to taste, and cook the mixture, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the broth and simmer the mixture, covered partially, for 2 minutes, or until the peas are barely tender. Boil the mixture, uncovered, for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the peas are tender and the liquid is almost evaporated.

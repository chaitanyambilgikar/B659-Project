In a large bowl wash arugula, endives, and radicchio in several changes of cold water and spin dry. In a serving bowl whisk together vinegar, mustard, and salt to taste and whisk in oil in a stream until emulsified. Add greens and toss to coat with vinaigrette. Season salad with pepper and toss again.

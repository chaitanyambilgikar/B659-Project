Halve and pit peaches. Holding each half over a bowl to catch any juices, slice peaches into bowl. Sprinkle brown sugar over peaches and toss to combine well. Let peaches stand at room temperature until juices are released, 20 to 30 minutes.
Just before serving, in a bowl beat heavy cream until it just holds soft peaks and stir in sour cream to make "skyr." With a slotted spoon divide peaches among 4 bowls, reserving juices. Top peaches with skyr and drizzle with reserved juices.

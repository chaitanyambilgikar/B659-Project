Clam Chowder Sauce In a medium saucepan over high heat, reduce the clam juice to 2 cups. Thoroughly scrub and rinse the clams under cold running water. In a large pot, heat the oil over high heat. Add the shallots, celery, garlic, tomato, parsley, and tomato paste and stir constantly for 30 seconds. Add the clams and stir for 30 seconds. Add the wine, cover, and continue cooking over high heat until most of the clams have opened, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and cool over an ice bath; discard any unopened clams. Reserve about 2 cups of cooking liquid. Remove all but 8 clams from the shells and cut away and discard the mantles, keeping only the bellies. In a medium saucepan, combine the reduced clam juice with the clam cooking liquid and bring to a simmer. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter until emulsified. Add the thyme sprigs, season with lemon juice to taste, and steep for 10 minutes. Remove and discard the thyme sprigs.
Clam Ragout In a medium sauté pan, bring the chicken stock to a simmer over medium-low heat. Add the shallot and simmer until tender, about 2 minutes. Add the corn kernels and simmer until cooked, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Add the celery and cook until tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the clams, confit cherry tomatoes, and celery leaves. Continue simmering until the celery leaves have wilted and the cherry tomatoes and clams are warm. Add the halved cherry tomatoes and the butter. Swirl the pan to melt the butter into the ragout and season with salt to taste.
To Finish Divide the clam chowder sauce among 4 bowls, reserving 1/4 cup for finishing. Divide the clam ragout among the bowls. Aerate the reserved clam chowder sauce with a hand blender and spoon the foam on top of each dish. Garnish with celery leaves and 2 clams in their shells and finish with olive oil.

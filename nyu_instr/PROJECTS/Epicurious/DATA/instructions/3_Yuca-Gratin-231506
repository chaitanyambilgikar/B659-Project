Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 400°F.
Cook yuca in a 4- to 5-quart pot of boiling salted water until fork-tender, about 25 minutes (thinner pieces may need less time and can be removed early with a slotted spoon).
While yuca cooks, bring cream, garlic, salt, and pepper just to a boil, uncovered, in a 2-quart saucepan over moderate heat, then remove from heat.
Drain yuca. When cool enough to handle, remove and discard thin fibrous cores if necessary, then cut yuca crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Layer slices evenly in a 2- to 2 1/2-quart shallow ovenproof baking dish.
Pour cream mixture over yuca. Bake gratin until cream is thickened and top is golden brown in spots, about 30 minutes.

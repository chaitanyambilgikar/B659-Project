Preheat oven to 425°F. Wrap beets tightly in foil, making 2 packages, and roast in middle of oven until tender, about 1 1/4 hours.
Toss carrots with oil and salt and pepper to taste in a shallow baking pan.
Remove beets from oven and roast carrots in middle of oven until tender, about 20 minutes.
While carrots are roasting, unwrap beets and, when just cool enough to handle, slip off skins and remove stems. Cut each beet into 6 wedges.
Add beets to carrots, tossing to combine, and roast until beets are hot and carrots are very tender, about 15 minutes more.

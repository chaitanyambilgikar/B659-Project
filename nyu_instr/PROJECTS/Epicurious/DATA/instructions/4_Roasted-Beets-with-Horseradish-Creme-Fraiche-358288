Preheat the oven to 400°F.
Cut off the beet greens, leaving 1/2 inch of the stems still attached. (You can save the leaves for sauteing laterâ€”they are delicious!) Clean the beets well, and toss them with 2 tablespoons olive oil and 1 teaspoon salt
Place the beets in a roasting pan with a splash of water in the bottom. Cover the pan tightly with foil, and roast for about 40 minutes, until they're tender when pierced. (The roasting time will depend on the size and type of beet.) When the beets are done, carefully remove the foil. Let cool, and peel the beets by slipping off the skins with your fingers. Cut them into 1/2-inch-thick wedges.
While the beets are in the oven, combine the diced shallot, both vinegars, 2 teaspoons lemon juice, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a small bowl, and let sit 5 minutes. Whisk in the 1/2 cup olive oil. Taste for balance and seasoning.
Whisk the crÃ¨me fraÃ®che and horseradish together in a small bowl. Stir in the heavy cream, remaining 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice, â…› teaspoon salt, and a pinch of pepper.
Toss the beets and sliced shallots with the vinaigrette. (If you're using different-colored beets, dress each color in a separate bowl so the colors don't bleed.) Season with 1/4 teaspoon salt and a pinch of freshly ground black pepper, and toss well. Taste for balance and seasoning.

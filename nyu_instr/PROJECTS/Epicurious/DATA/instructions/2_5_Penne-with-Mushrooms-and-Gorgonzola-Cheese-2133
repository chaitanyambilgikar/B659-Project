Heat olive oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add garlic; sauté 1 minute. Add mushrooms; sauté until beginning to soften, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes, basil and oregano and simmer until sauce thickens slightly, about 5 minutes. (Can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.)
Cook penne in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite. Drain, reserving 1/2 cup cooking liquid. Add pasta and cooking liquid to sauce in skillet. Toss over medium heat until mixture is heated through and sauce coats pasta. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer pasta to bowl. Sprinkle with Gorgonzola cheese and serve.

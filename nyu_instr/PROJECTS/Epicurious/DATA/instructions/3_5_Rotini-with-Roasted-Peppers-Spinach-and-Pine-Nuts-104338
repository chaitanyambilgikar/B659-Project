Mix flour and butter in small bowl to form paste. Heat oil in large skillet over medium heat. Add onions; sauté until tender, about 5 minutes. Add garlic; sauté 1 minute. Add broth, wine, thyme and dried red pepper; simmer until liquid is reduced by half, about 6 minutes. Whisk in flour paste. Simmer until sauce thickens slightly, about 1 minute. Season with salt and pepper. Add roasted peppers and spinach and simmer until spinach wilts, about 2 minutes.
Meanwhile, cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally. Drain pasta well.

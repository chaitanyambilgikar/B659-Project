Mix first 7 ingredients and 1 teaspoon soy sauce in large bowl. Cover and refrigerate 30 minutes.
Brush baking sheet with water. Using wet hands, shape generous 1/4 cup chicken mixture into 4-inch-long log. Insert 2 skewers lengthwise into meat, each slightly off center. Push skewers all the way through meat, leaving 3 inches of skewers exposed on each end. Transfer to prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining chicken mixture and skewers to form total of 8 skewers.
Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Mix remaining 2 tablespoons soy sauce and mirin in small bowl. Space 2 bricks 4 1/2 inches apart and wide sides down on grill. Working in batches, suspend skewers across bricks, allowing skewer ends to rest on bricks (meat will not touch grill). Cook until golden, turning occasionally, about 8 minutes. Brush with soy sauce mixture and cook until chicken is cooked through, about 1 minute per side. Brush with more soy sauce mixture; transfer to plates. Sprinkle with shichimi togarashi.

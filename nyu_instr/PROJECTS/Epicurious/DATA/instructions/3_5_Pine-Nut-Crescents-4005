Butter and lightly flour heavy large baking sheet. Finely grind almonds in processor. Add sugar, powdered sugar, flour and salt; process until well blended. Add egg whites; process until smooth dough forms (dough will be very sticky).
Spread pine nuts on floured surface. Using floured hands, form dough into 1-inch balls. Roll balls in pine nuts, pressing slightly to adhere. Form balls into crescents. Transfer to prepared baking sheet, spacing 1 inch apart. Let cookies stand at room temperature at least 1 hour and up to 2 hours before baking.
Preheat oven to 350°F. Bake cookies until golden brown, about 18 minutes. Transfer cookies to rack and cool completely. (Can be prepared 2 days ahead. Store in airtight container.)

Squeeze enough juice from 1/2 orange to measure 2 tablespoons. Cut peel, including all white pith, from remaining 4 oranges with a sharp knife and discard, then cut oranges crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices.
Cook sugar in a dry small heavy saucepan over moderate heat, undisturbed, until it begins to melt. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally with a fork, until sugar is melted into a deep golden caramel. Add juice and wine carefully (caramel will harden and steam vigorously). Cook over moderately low heat, stirring, until caramel is dissolved, about 5 minutes. Remove sauce from heat.
Arrange orange slices, overlapping, in 4 shallow bowls and spoon sauce over fruit. Let macerate at least 30 minutes before serving.

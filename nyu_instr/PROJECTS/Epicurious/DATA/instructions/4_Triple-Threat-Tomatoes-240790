1. Cut each tomato into three 1/2-inch slices. Spread 8 of the slices with about a tablespoon each of Chickpea Slather. Dress 8 other tomato slices with the Black Olive Spread. Top remaining slices with the pesto. Arrange all the tomato slices on a decorative platter garnished with the basil leaf.
2. Place the ricotta in a medium-sized bowl; drizzle with oliveoil and sprinkle with pepper. Serve the ricotta and bread alongside the tomato platter.

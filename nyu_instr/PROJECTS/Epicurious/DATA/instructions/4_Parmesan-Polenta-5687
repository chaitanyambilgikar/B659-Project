Bring chicken stock to boil in heavy large saucepan. Reduce heat to medium. Gradually whisk in cornmeal. Cook until cornmeal is very soft and mixture is thick and creamy, whisking occasionally, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in Parmesan cheese and butter. Season polenta to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer to bowl and serve.

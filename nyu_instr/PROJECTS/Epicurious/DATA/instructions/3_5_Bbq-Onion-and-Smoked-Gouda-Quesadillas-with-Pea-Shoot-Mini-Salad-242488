Preheat oven to 300°F. Heat 3 tablespoons oil in large nonstick skillet over high heat. Add onions and sauté until almost soft, about 5 minutes. Add barbecue sauce and 2 tablespoons water. Stir until onions are evenly coated, about 2 minutes.
Place 4 tortillas on work surface. Sprinkle 1/4 of cheese, then 1/4 of cilantro and 1/4 of onions on each tortilla. Top each with second tortilla and press to adhere.
Brush skillet with 1 teaspoon oil; heat over medium-high heat. Add 1 quesadilla; cook until cheese is melted, about 2 minutes per side. Place on baking sheet in oven. Repeat with remaining quesadillas.
Cut each quesadilla into quarters; arrange 4 quarters on each plate. Toss pea shoots in medium bowl with 5 teaspoons oil, hot sauce, and pinch of salt. Serve salad with quesadillas.

Drain yogurt in a paper-towel-lined large sieve set over a bowl, covered and chilled, 24 hours. Discard any liquid in bowl.
Preheat oven to 350°F.
Toss shredded wheat with butter and sugar in a bowl, then spread evenly on a baking sheet and bake in middle of oven until deep golden, about 12 minutes. Cool completely.
Simmer water, honey, zest, and orange juice in a small saucepan, uncovered, until reduced to about 1/2 cup, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and let steep, covered, 10 minutes. Cool syrup, then pour through a sieve into a small bowl, reserving zest.
Finely chop half of zest and stir into yogurt in a bowl along with 4 tablespoons syrup. Thinly slice remaining zest for garnish.
Beat cream in a small deep bowl with a whisk or an electric mixer until it just holds stiff peaks, then fold into yogurt. Divide yogurt among 6 small dessert dishes, then drizzle remaining syrup over it and top with wheat crisps and sliced zest.

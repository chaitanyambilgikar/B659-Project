Soak raisins in hot water until ready to use.
Cut out a 10-inch round of parchment paper.
Heat sugar in center of a 10-inch heavy skillet over medium heat until it starts to melt. Cook, tilting skillet occasionally so sugar melts evenly, until golden brown. Stir in butter, then add onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until they are beginning to brown, about 3 minutes. Add wine, bay leaf, 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and pepper, and drained raisins.
Reduce heat to low and cover onions with parchment, then with lid. Gently simmer, shaking skillet occasionally, until onions are tender, 18 to 20 minutes.
Remove lid and parchment, then simmer, stirring occasionally, until liquid is reduced to a glaze, about 3 minutes. Discard bay leaf. Serve warm or at room temperature.

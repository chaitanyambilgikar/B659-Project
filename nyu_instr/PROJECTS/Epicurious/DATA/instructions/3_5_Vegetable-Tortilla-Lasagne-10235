Sprinkle vegetables with salt and pepper to taste and roast on 2 racks in oven about 5 minutes. Stir corn and switch positions of pans in oven. Roast vegetables about 5 minutes more, or until browned lightly.

Spread 1/4 cup salsa over tortillas and top with half cheese mixture, half zucchini, half peppers, half corn, and 1 tablespoon coriander. Make another layer of tortillas and vegetables in same manner. Top with remaining 2 tortillas, 1/2 cup salsa, 1/4 cup Monterey Jack,and 1 tablespoon coriander.

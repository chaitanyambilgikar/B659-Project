Make soup: Pat fish dry and sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt.
Cook onion, celery, and garlic in oil with 1/2 teaspoon salt in a deep 12-inch heavy skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until onion is softened but not browned, about 8 minutes. Add parsley and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add wine and boil until liquid is reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes, water, and 1 teaspoon salt and bring to a simmer. Add fish and reduce heat to cook at a bare simmer until just cooked through, about 10 minutes.
Make toasts while fish cooks: Preheat broiler.
Cut 18 (1/2-inch) slices from baguette and toast 3 to 5 inches from heat, turning once, until golden, 3 to 4 minutes total.
Cut garlic clove in half and rub on toasts, then brush toasts with oil. Serve with soup

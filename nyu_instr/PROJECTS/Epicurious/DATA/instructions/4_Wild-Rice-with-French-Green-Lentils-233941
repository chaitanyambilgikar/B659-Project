Bring 2 1/2 cups water and 1 teaspoon salt to boil in medium saucepan. Add rice and bring to boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until rice is just tender, about 45 minutes. Drain. Return rice to pan.
Meanwhile, insert cloves into onion. Heat oil in large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion, carrot, celery, and garlic; sauté until beginning to brown, about 10 minutes. Add pancetta and sauté until crisp, about 5 minutes. Add lentils; stir 1 minute. Add 1 3/4 cups water, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and bay leaf; bring to boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until lentils are tender, about 35 minutes. Remove from heat (some liquid may remain in pan). Discard onion, carrot, celery, and bay leaf. Stir rice into lentil mixture. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.)
Simmer rice-lentil mixture uncovered over medium heat until heated through and liquid is absorbed, about 6 minutes. Stir in parsley. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve.

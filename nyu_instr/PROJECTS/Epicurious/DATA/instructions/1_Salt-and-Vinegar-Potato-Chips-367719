Using a mandoline, thinly slice potatoes (just under 1/8" thick). Let soak in a bowl of warm water for 5 minutes. Drain; repeat. Pat potatoes very dry.
Meanwhile, pour oil into a large pot to a depth of 1 1/2". Attach a deep-fry thermometer to side of pot; heat oil over medium heat to 320°F.
Working in batches of about 20 slices and returning oil to 320°F after each batch, fry potatoes, stirring gently, until they are golden brown and oil stops sizzling, 3-4 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer chips to paper towels to drain. Season each batch generously with salt and 1/4 teaspoon vinegar powder.

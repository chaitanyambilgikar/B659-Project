Coat a medium nonstick skillet with cooking spray; place over medium-low heat. Add the onion; cook for 2 minutes, until softened, stirring. Add the curry paste, cumin, and cinnamon; cook for 30 seconds, stirring to dissolved the paste. Add the sweet potato; cook for 2 minutes, stirring to coat.
Pour in the milk. Simmer for 12 minutes, until the sweet potato is tender, stirring often and adding more milk if the mixture dries out.
Transfer to a food processor or blender. Add the yogurt and lime juice; process until smooth. Season with salt and pepper. Serve with the warm bread.

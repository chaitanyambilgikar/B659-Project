1. Preheat the oven to 400°F.
2. With the tip of a sharp knife, make deep little slits all over the tenderloin and insert the garlic slivers. Season with salt, pepper, and cumin.
3. Place the oil in an oven-proof skillet and sear the tenderloin well on medium-high heat for about 10 minutes, turning the meat over as it browns.
4. Add the chicken broth and white wine to the pan and place it in the oven for 10 minutes. Remove it and let it rest for 10 to 12 minutes, before carving. It will continue to cook as it sits. Slice and serve immediately.

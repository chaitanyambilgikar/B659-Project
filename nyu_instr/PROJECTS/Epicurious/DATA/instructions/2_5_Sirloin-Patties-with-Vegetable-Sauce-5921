Mix beef, 1/4 cup broth, crackers, 2 tablespoons parsley, garlic, salt, and pepper in large bowl. Shape mixture into 2 1/2-inch-diameter, 1/2-inch-thick patties. Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Working in 2 batches, sauté patties until brown and cooked through, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer to plate.
Add potato, carrots, and celery to same skillet; sauté 5 minutes, scraping up browned bits. Add tomato sauce, olives, and remaining 1 cup broth and 2 tablespoons parsley. Cover and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes. Place patties in skillet atop vegetable sauce. Cover and simmer until heated through, about 10 minutes.

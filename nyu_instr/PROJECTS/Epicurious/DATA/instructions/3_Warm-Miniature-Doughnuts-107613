Sift together flour, baking powder, baking soda, spices, and salt into a bowl. Whisk in brown sugar, breaking up any lumps. Whisk together buttermilk, butter, and egg in a small bowl, then add to flour mixture, whisking until just combined.
Heat 2 inches oil in a deep 3-quart heavy saucepan until it registers 375°F on thermometer. Working in batches of 6, scoop out a rounded teaspoon (not a measuring spoon) of batter per doughnut and scrape batter from spoon into oil with another spoon, keeping ball as round as possible. Once 6 balls are in oil, turn them over with a slotted spoon and continue to cook, turning occasionally, until deep brown and cooked through, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Transfer doughnuts as fried with slotted spoon to paper towels to drain and return oil to 375°F between batches. Cool doughnuts to warm, at least 10 minutes.
If desired, coat with confectioners sugar just before serving: Put sugar in a small sealed plastic bag and shake doughnuts, a few at a time, to coat.

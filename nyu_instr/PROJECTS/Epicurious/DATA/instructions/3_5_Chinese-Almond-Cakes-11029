Into a bowl sift together the flour and the baking powder and blend in the lard, the vegetable shortening, and the sugar until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Stir in the almond extract, the egg, and 1 tablespoon water, or enough to form the mixture into a soft dough, knead the dough several times, and let it stand in a cool place for 5 minutes. Form the dough into 1 1/2-inch balls and press them down with the palm of the hand to form cakes about 1/2 inch thick. Press an almond into the center of each cake and bake the cakes in batches on floured baking sheets in the middle of a preheated 375°F. oven for 5 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 300°F. and bake the cakes for 8 to 10 minutes more, or until they are light golden brown.

Combine all ingredients for sauce; set aside.
In a large pot place water and salt and bring to a boil over high heat. Add noodles, cook 45 seconds to 1 minute, or al dente, stirring and loosening them with chopsticks as they cook. Turn off heat, run cold water into pot, drain noodles immediately through a strainer. Place noodles back into pot and fill with cold water. Mix with hands, drain again through strainer. Repeat until noodles are cool. Allow to drain 10 to 15 minutes, loosening with chopsticks. Reserve.
Heat wok over high heat 45 seconds. Add peanut oil, coat wok with spatula. When a wisp of white smoke appears, add ginger, stir-fry 45 seconds. Stir sauce, pour in, mix well, allow to boil. Add noodles, stir, mix so noodles absorb the sauce. Add scallions, stir together for 2 minutes. Turn off heat, transfer to a heated dish and serve immediately.

Preheat broiler and line a shallow baking pan with foil.
Trim pineapple leaves to about 2 inches. Quarter pineapple lengthwise, reserving 2 quarters for another use. Cut and discard cores from remaining quarters. With a sharp knife cut fruit from rinds, keeping rinds intact and reserving them. Cut pineapple crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices.
In a small saucepan cook butter, 2 tablespoons brown sugar, and rum over moderate heat, stirring, 1 minute. Add pineapple, stirring to coat, and cook mixture 1 minute.
Put reserved rinds in baking pan and with a fork and spoon return pineapple pieces to rinds, arranging in original shape. Spoon remaining butter mixture over pineapple and sprinkle tops with remaining tablespoon brown sugar. Broil pineapple about 3 inches from heat until slightly charred and heated through, about 8 minutes.
Serve caramelized pineapple with ice cream.

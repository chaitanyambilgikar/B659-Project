Bring cherries, almond syrup, sugar, lemon juice, and 1/4 cup water to a simmer in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until liquid is slightly syrupy but cherries still hold their shape, about 5 minutes. Transfer mixture to a bowl and let cool completely. Chill until cold. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 week ahead. Cover and keep chilled.
Divide yogurt among bowls. Spoon cherries with juices over. Garnish with chopped almonds.

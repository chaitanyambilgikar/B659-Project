Bring berries, sugar, vinegar, and water to a boil in a small heavy saucepan, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, 20 minutes. Strain thourough a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, pressing gently on and then discarding solids. You should have about 1 cup syrup. If more, boil until reduced. Cool, then chill, covered.

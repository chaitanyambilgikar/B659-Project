1. Cut the fish into strips 1 1/2 inches long by 1/4 inch wide. Soak the strips in lightly salted water for 1 hour to tenderize. Drain well.
2. Put the fish in a bowl and fold in the lime juice carefully. Add the salt, garlic, and aji and refrigerate for 15 to 20 minutes.
3. Just before serving, mix in the parsley, cilantro, and onion.
4. To serve, line a bowl or large platter with the lettuce. Place the ceviche in the center. Surround it with 3 separate mounds: corn pieces at the top of the platter, sweet potato slices on one end, yucca on the other. Garnish with the seaweed, if using.

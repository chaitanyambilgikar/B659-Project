Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add a generous sprinkling of salt and the fresh beans, and cook until the beans are just tender, about 8 minutes. Drain the beans in a colander, and shock in ice water to stop the cooking process. Drain again and set aside.
Place the fresh and canned beans, scallions, bell pepper, parsley, marjoram, and Champagne Vinaigrette in a large bowl, and toss to combine. Season the salad to taste with salt, pepper, and hot sauce.

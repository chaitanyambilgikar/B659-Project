Shuck corn and, working over a 6-to-8 quart kettle, cut off kernels, reserving cobs. In kettle simmer corn, cobs, water, and salt and pepper to taste, uncovered, until corn is tender, 10 to 20 minutes. Carefully pour off liquid from tofu. Discard cobs and transfer half of corn mixture to a bowl. In a blender in batches purée tofu with corn mixture from bowl until smooth, transferring to kettle. Finely chop basil and stir into chowder with scallions and salt to taste. Heat chowder over moderate heat, stirring, until heated through.
Garnish chowder with basil sprigs and serve with jalapeño sauce.

In a 6-to-8 quart kettle cook onions in butter over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes. Stir in garlic paste and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add wine and boil until liquid is reduced to about 1 tablespoon. Stir in bell peppers and broth and simmer, covered, until peppers are tender, 20 to 25 minutes.
In a blender or food processor purée mixture in batches (use caution when blending hot liquids) until smooth and transfer to a large bowl. Season purée with salt and pepper and cool completely. Chill soup, covered, until cold, at least 4 hours, and up to 2 days. Whisk in sour cream and season with salt and pepper.
Garnish soup with chives.

Make chutney: Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions and sauté until golden, about 30 minutes. Stir in both vinegars. Add apples, mustard seeds, sugar, ginger and allspice. Reduce heat to medium and sauté until apples are tender, about 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, prepare pork: Preheat oven to 375°F. Sprinkle pork with salt and pepper. Melt butter with oil in large wide ovenproof pot over medium-high heat until butter begins to brown. Add pork and cook until brown on all sides, about 8 minutes. Add 3/4 cup chicken broth to pot. Cover pot. Transfer to oven and roast until thermometer inserted into center of pork registers 150°F, about 35 minutes. Transfer pork to platter. Tent with foil to keep warm.
Pour cooking liquid from pot into 2-cup glass measuring cup (do not clean pot). Freeze liquid 5 minutes. Spoon fat off top of cooking liquid, returning 1 tablespoon fat to same pot. Add cooking liquid, apple chutney and remaining 1/2 cup broth to pot. Simmer mixture 4 minutes to blend flavors. Season chutney to taste with salt and pepper.
Slice pork. Spoon apple chutney over pork and serve.

Sprinkle gelatin over milk in a small saucepan and let soften.
Beat together whole egg, yolk, and sugar in a small metal bowl with a handheld electric mixer until blended. Set bowl over a saucepan of barely simmering water and beat with mixer until pale, thick, and tripled in volume, about 5 minutes. (Mixture should mound when dropped from beaters.) Remove bowl from heat.
Heat milk over low heat, stirring, just until gelatin is dissolved, then beat into egg mixture.
Blend ricotta in a food processor just until smooth. Add fruit, chocolate, zests, vanilla, cinnamon, and a pinch of salt and pulse until blended, then transfer to a bowl. Stir in one third of egg mixture to lighten, then fold in remaining egg mixture gently but thoroughly.
Beat cream in a bowl with cleaned beaters just until it holds soft peaks, then fold into ricotta mixture gently but thoroughly. Spoon into lightly oiled ramekins and chill, covered, until firm, at least 2 hours.
Run a knife around edge of each ramekin, then dip ramekin into a bowl of hot tap water 10 seconds. Invert a plate over each ramekin, then invert pudding onto plate.

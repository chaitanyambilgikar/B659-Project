Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper. Add chicken, bell peppers, onion, garlic and oregano to pot. Sauté 5 minutes. Mix in paprika and cayenne pepper. Add rice and stir to coat. Mix in 2 cups broth and tomato sauce. Bring to boil. Cover pot; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until chicken and rice are tender and liquids are absorbed, adding more broth by 1/4 cupfuls if dry, about 25 minutes.
Mix peas into chicken and rice. Cook until peas are heated through, about 2 minutes longer. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve.

Pat scallops dry. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Heat oil in heavy large skillet over high heat. Add scallops and cook until brown on bottom, about 3minutes. Turn scallops over and cook until opaque in center, about 1 minute longer. Transfer scallops to plate. Tent with foil.
Reduce heat to medium. Melt butter in same skillet. Add flour, stir 1 minute. Gradually whisk in milk. Simmer until thick and smooth, stirring often, about 3 minutes. Stir in tarragon and any juices from scallops on plate. Season with salt and pepper. Spoon onto plates. Arrange scallops, brown side up, atop sauce.

Preheat the oven to 500°F. To prepare foil packets, place a sheet of foil directly on top of another; make 4 of these 2-sheet sets. Smear 1 tsp grapeseed oil to the size of a chicken breast in the center of each top sheet. Place 1/2 cup watercress over oil, then place a chicken breast on top of watercress. Sprinkle with pepper. Arrange mangoes and 2 mushroom caps on top of and around each piece of chicken. Crimp the packet edges up slightly. Bring soy sauce, ketchup and vinegar to a boil, then stir in ginger and garlic. Remove the pan from heat and pour 1/4 sauce over each chicken breast. Fold foil over each chicken breast in half and tightly crimp the edges to close the packets. Heat a baking sheet in the oven 1 minute and place the 4 packets on the sheet. Bake 12 minutes, then remove from oven. Slit the top of the packets to serve (be careful; steam will come out), or let diners open their own packets.

With a vegetable peeler remove 2 strips zest from orange (each about 3 by 1/2 inch) and mince.
Squeeze enough juice from orange to measure 1/2 cup and in a small heavy saucepan simmer orange juice until reduced to 1/4 cup.
Remove pan from heat and add sugar and butter to orange juice, whisking until butter is melted. Whisk in egg until combined well and cook mixture over moderately low heat, whisking, until thick enough to hold marks of whisk and first bubble appears on surface, 3 to 5 minutes.
Remove pan from heat and add zest to orange curd, whisking. Pour orange curd into a bowl set in a larger bowl of ice and cold water and stir until cold.
In another bowl beat cream until it just holds stiff peaks and fold into orange curd gently but thoroughly.
Spoon orange fool into 2 chilled goblets.

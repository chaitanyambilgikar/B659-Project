In a large bowl soak noodles in boiling water to cover 5 to 10 minutes, or until opaque-white and tender, and drain well in a colander.
Cut carrots on diagonal into 1/4-inch-thick slices and cut slices lengthwise into thin strips. In a large steamer rack set over boiling water steam broccoli, covered, 1 minute. Add carrots and leek and steam, covered 1 minute. Add onion and steam, covered, 1 minute. Transfer vegetables to a large bowl.
Make sauce: In a small bowl stir together sauce ingredients in order given until cornstarch is dissolved.
Heat a wok over high heat until hot and add oil. Heat oil until a wisp of white smoke appears and stir-fry garlic and gingerroot until fragrant, about 5 seconds. Add curry powder and turmeric and stir-fry 5 seconds. Stir sauce and add to curry mixture. Bring curry sauce to a boil, stirring.
Add noodles, scallions, and steamed vegetables to curry sauce and gently stir-fry until noodles are coated well with sauce. Serves 4.

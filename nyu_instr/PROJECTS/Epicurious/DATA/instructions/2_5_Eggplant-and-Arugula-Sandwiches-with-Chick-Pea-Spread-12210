Preheat broiler.
On rack of a broiler pan arrange eggplant slices in one layer, seasoning both sides with salt and pepper. Broil eggplant about 4 inches from heat, turning once, until golden, 3 to 5 minutes on each side.
In a food processor purée chick-peas, parsley, garlic paste, water, lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste until smooth. In a bowl toss together arugula, oil, vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste.
Spread chick-pea purée evenly on 2 bread slices and top each slice with half of eggplant slices, half of arugula mixture, and remaining 2 bread slices.

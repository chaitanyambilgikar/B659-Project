Preheat oven to 350° F. and line a large baking sheet with foil.
In a large bowl with an electric mixer beat together whites, sugar, cornstarch, vinegar, and vanilla on low speed until just combined. Add boiling water all at once and beat on high speed 3 to 5 minutes, or until mixture forms stiff, glossy peaks.
Spoon meringue mixture onto baking sheet and spread into a 9- to 10-inch circle. Bake Pavlova in middle of oven 10 minutes. Reduce temperature to 200° F. and bake Pavlova 40 minutes more. Turn off oven and let Pavlova stand in oven 1 hour. Transfer Pavlova to a rack and cool completely. (Pavlova will be hard on outer surface and soft inside.)
In a bowl with cleaned beaters beat cream until it holds soft peaks and spread over Pavlova. Mound fruit on top of whipped cream.

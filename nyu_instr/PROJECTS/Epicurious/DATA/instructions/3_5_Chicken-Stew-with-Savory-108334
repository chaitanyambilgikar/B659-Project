Cook pork in a wide 6- to 7-quart heavy pot over moderate heat, stirring, until golden and fat is rendered, about 8 minutes. Transfer pork with a slotted spoon to paper towels and pour off all but about 2 tablespoons fat from pot.
Pat chicken dry and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Brown chicken in fat in pot over moderately high heat in 2 batches, skin sides down first and turning over once, about 6 minutes per batch. Transfer chicken to 2 plates, breast pieces on one and the rest on the other.
Add butter to fat in pot, then cook onions, carrots, and savory over moderately low heat, stirring, until vegetables are softened. Add flour and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add water in a stream, whisking, then add remaining teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper and bring to a boil over high heat. Return chicken, except breast pieces, and salt pork to pot, then reduce heat and simmer, partially covered, stirring occasionally, 20 minutes.
Peel potatoes and cut into 3/4-inch cubes. Add potatoes and breast pieces to pot, then simmer, partially covered, until chicken is cooked through and potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes.

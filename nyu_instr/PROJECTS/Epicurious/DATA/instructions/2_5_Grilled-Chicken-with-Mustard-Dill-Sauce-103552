Prepare grill.
Stir together honey, mustards, dill, yogurt, and salt and pepper to taste.
Pat chicken dry, then brush with oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill chicken on an oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals 1 to 2 minutes on each side, or until just cooked through.
Serve chicken with sauce.

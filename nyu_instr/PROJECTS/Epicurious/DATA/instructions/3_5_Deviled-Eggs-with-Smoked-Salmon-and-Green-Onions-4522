Cook potato in pot of boiling salted water until very tender, about 10 minutes. Drain. Cool potato.
Meanwhile, place eggs in medium saucepan; cover with water. Bring to boil. Cover; remove from heat and let stand 15 minutes. Drain. Rinse eggs with cold water until cool. Peel off shells. Halve eggs lengthwise. Reserve 3 egg yolks for another use. Combine remaining 3 yolks, potato, oil, lemon juice and mustard in medium bowl. Mash with fork until well blended. Stir in 2 tablespoons salmon and 1 1/2 tablespoons green onions. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Divide potato-and-yolk mixture among hard-boiled egg white halves, mounding slightly. (Eggs can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate.) Garnish eggs with 2 tablespoons salmon and 1 1/2 tablespoons green onions.

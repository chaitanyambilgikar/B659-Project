Sauté turkey in heavy large nonstick skillet over medium heat until cooked through and brown, breaking up meat with fork, about 5 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer turkey to small bowl. Add onion to drippings in skillet and sauté until light brown, about 7 minutes. Return turkey and any juices to skillet. Add tomato sauce and Cajun seasoning; simmer until mixture is almost dry, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Cool completely. Mix in cheese. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.)
On lightly floured surface, roll out 1 biscuit dough piece to 4-inch-diameter round. Place 1 tablespoon filling on round. Brush half of dough edge with beaten egg. Fold dough over filling to create half circle and seal edges by pressing with tines of fork. Set empanada on baking sheet and cover with damp cloth. Repeat with remaining biscuits and filling.
Pour oil to depth of 1/2 inch into heavy large skillet. Heat oil over medium-high heat to 350°F. Fry empanadas in batches until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to paper towels. Serve warm or at room temperature.

For salsa, combine all ingredients except the salmon in a small bowl. Cover and chill at least 30 minutes. Lightly coat grill or broiler pan with cooking spray. Sprinkle both sides of fish with salt and pepper. Grill or broil fish 5 minutes on each side or until done. Top each steak with 1/4 cup salsa and serve with whole-wheat couscous if desired.

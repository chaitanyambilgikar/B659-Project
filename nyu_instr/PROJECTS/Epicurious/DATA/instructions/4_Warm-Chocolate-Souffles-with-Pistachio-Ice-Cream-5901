Preheat oven to 400°F. Butter eight 3/4-cup soufflé dishes or custard cups. Melt chocolate and butter in heavy medium saucepan over medium-low heat until smooth. Transfer to large bowl; cool.
Using electric mixer, beat egg whites to soft peaks. Gradually add sugar; beat until stiff but not dry.
Whisk yolks, flour and vanilla into melted chocolate mixture. Fold in 1/3 of egg whites to lighten. Fold in remaining whites. Divide soufflé mixture evenly among soufflé dishes. Transfer to baking sheet. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate.)
Bake soufflés until edges are set but tester inserted into center comes out with wet batter attached, about 15 minutes if baked immediately or 20 minutes if refrigerated overnight. Serve immediately with Pistachio Ice Cream.

Make tahini sauce In food processor or blender, combine all ingredients and 1/4 cup water. Process into smooth paste. (DO AHEAD: Sauce can be made ahead and refrigerated, covered, up to 1 day.)
Make falafel In food processor, combine chickpeas, onion, garlic, parsley, cumin, coriander, salt, red pepper flakes, and baking soda. Pulse just until finely chopped and crumbly (mixture will resemble wet bread crumbs; do not overprocess into paste, or balls will be heavy). (DO AHEAD: Mixture can be made ahead and refrigerated, covered, up to 1 day.)
In large shallow skillet over moderately high heat, heat 3 inches oil until thermometer registers 350°F.
Using 2 teaspoons or falafel scoop, form mixture into approximately 1-inch-diameter balls or disks. Working in batches of 5, lower carefully into hot oil and fry, turning occasionally, until deep golden brown, about 1 to 2 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Repeat to fry remaining falafel, returning oil to 350°F between each batch.

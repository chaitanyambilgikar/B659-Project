1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Butter and flour a 12-cup bundt pan.
2. Using a fork, combine flour, baking powder, spices, baking soda, and salt in a bowl. In another bowl, combine apples, raisins and walnuts; add 3 tablespoons of flour mixture and toss to coat. Set aside.
3. Combine the butter, brown sugar, and vanilla in a mixing bowl; cream until the mixture is light and creamy. Beat in the eggs one at a time. Stir in the buttermilk and applesauce.
4. Slowly add the remaining flour mixture to the butter mixture, beating until blended. Stir in reserved fruit-nut mixture. Pour batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour. Let cake cool, still in the pan, for 1 hour.
5. Combine syrup ingredients in a saucepan; heat to a simmer. When sugar dissolves, remove from heat; set aside for 15 minutes.
6. Unmold the cake onto a serving platter. Prick it all over with a wooden skewer. Strain the syrup (discarding lemon zest) and brush the cake with the syrup until it has been absorbed. Before serving, dust the top with confectioners' sugar.

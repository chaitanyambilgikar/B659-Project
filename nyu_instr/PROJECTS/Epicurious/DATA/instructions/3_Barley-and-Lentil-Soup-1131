Heat oil in heavy 4-quart saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onions and garlic and sauté until onions are translucent, about 10 minutes. Add next 6 ingredients. Cook until bell pepper just softens, stirring occasionally, 6 minutes.
Mix in 5 cans broth, tomatoes and tomato paste. Bring mixture to boil. Stir in barley and lentils. Reduce heat and simmer until barley and lentils are tender, stirring occasionally, about 1 1/2 hours.
Thin soup to desired consistency with remaining broth. Season with salt and pepper. Ladle into soup bowls and garnish with parsley if desired.

In a bowl toss together the peaches, the lemon juice, and 1 tablespoon of the brown sugar and in a buttered flameproof baking pan large enough to hold the peaches in one layer broil the mixture about 6 inches from a preheated broiler for 5 to 7 minutes, or until the peaches are tender. In a small bowl combine the remaining 1 teaspoon brown sugar, the butter, and the cookie crumbs and sprinkle the topping over the peaches. Broil the mixture for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the topping is pale golden. Divide the mixture between 2 dishes and serve it with the cream.

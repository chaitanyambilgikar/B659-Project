Line six 3/4-cup custard cups or soufflé dishes with plastic wrap, overlapping sides by at least 2 inches. Using 2 1/2- to 2 3/4-inch-diameter cookie cutter, cut out 1 round from each of 12 bread slices. Place 1 bread round in bottom of each custard cup. Cut remaining 6 bread slices into 1-inch-wide strips. Line sides of custard cups with bread strips, trimming to fit and lining cups completely.
Combine 2 1/2 cups raspberries and 2 1/2 cups blackberries, sugar, currant jelly, 1/4 cup water and lemon juice in large saucepan. Stir over low heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat to medium; sim-mer until berries soften and begin to release juices, about 5 minutes (some berries will fall apart). Divide warm berry mixture among bread-lined cups, reserving 1/2 cup juices. Cover berry mixture with remaining 6 bread rounds, pressing down slightly. Pour 1/2 cup berry juices over puddings. Fold in plastic overhang. Place small plates atop puddings; weight down with cans. Chill overnight.
Remove cans and plates. Unfold plastic wrap. Invert puddings onto plates; remove plastic. Spoon Vanilla Whipped Cream alongside. Garnish with additional berries, if desired.

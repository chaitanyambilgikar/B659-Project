Heat oven to 400°F. In a large baking dish, combine tomatoes, onion, 1/4 cup oil, garlic, pepper flakes (if desired) and 1 tablespoon salt; cover; roast 45 minutes. Remove dish from oven; mash mixture to break down tomatoes. Cook, uncovered, until sauce is thick and reduced, 45 minutes. In a bowl, soak bread in milk until it absorbs liquid, 10 minutes; add turkey, egg and remaining 1 teaspoon salt; mix until just combined. Gently roll meat mixture into 16 equal-sized balls. In a large nonstick saucepan, heat remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons oil over medium-high heat. Sauté meatballs, turning occasionally, until light brown, 5 minutes. Add tomato sauce to meatballs; reduce heat; simmer until cooked through, 20 minutes. Cook pasta as directed on package. Serve sauce over pasta; top with cheese, if desired.

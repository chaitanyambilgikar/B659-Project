Preheat oven to 450°F. Lightly spray rimmed baking sheet with vegetable oil spray. Mix potatoes, parsnips and oil in large bowl. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Spread vegetables on prepared baking sheet. Roast vegetables until beginning to soften, about 20 minutes. Turn vegetables over; continue to roast until tender and beginning to brown, about 10 minutes.
Remove vegetables from oven. Push vegetables together in center of baking sheet, forming base for salmon. Sprinkle peas over. Arrange salmon atop vegetables. Sprinkle with thyme, salt and pepper. Roast until fish is just opaque in center, about 10 minutes. Transfer fish and vegetables to plates. Garnish with lemon.

Preheat oven to 400°F. Spray rimmed baking sheet with nonstick spray. Brush turkey breast with 1 tablespoon oil; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place on prepared sheet. Roast until thermometer inserted into thickest part of turkey registers 170°F and juices run clear when pierced with fork, about 45 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes (internal temperature of turkey will increase to 175°F).
Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add bell peppers and onion; sauté until tender and brown around edges, about 10 minutes. Add thyme; stir 2 minutes. Mix in 2 tablespoons vinegar and capers. Season with salt and pepper.
Remove bones from turkey. Thinly slice turkey crosswise. Transfer to platter and keep warm. Place baking sheet over 2 stove-top burners; add remaining 3 tablespoons vinegar to baking sheet and bring to boil, scraping up browned bits. Pour vinegar over turkey. Arrange bell pepper mixture around turkey and serve.

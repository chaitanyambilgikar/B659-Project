Preheat oven to 450°F.
Thinly slice garlic and shell shrimp. Very coarsely chop parsley. In an 8-inch round shallow baking dish bake garlic in oil in middle of oven 5 minutes, or until garlic is lightly colored. Add shrimp, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste and toss to combine. Bake shrimp, turning them once, until just cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes. Stir in remaining tablespoon lemon juice.
Sprinkle parsley over shrimp and serve with bread.

Combine brown sugar, raisins, vinegar, ginger, capers, red pepper flakes, and black pepper in a medium skillet. Cook over medium heat, stirring often, until liquid is reduced by half, about 5 minutes.
Add rhubarb to skillet and stir to coat. Cook, swirling pan occasionally, until rhubarb is tender and liquid is syrupy, about 15 minutes. Serve compote warm or at room temperature.
DO AHEAD: Compote can be made 5 days ahead. Let cool; cover and chill. Reheat slightly, if desired, before serving.

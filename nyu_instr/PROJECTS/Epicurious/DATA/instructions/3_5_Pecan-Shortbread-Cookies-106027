Finely grind toasted pecans and sugar in processor. Blend in flour, baking soda, and salt. Add butter; cut in using on/off turns until coarse meal forms. Add cream and vanilla. Process using on/off turns until moist clumps form. Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk. Place sheet of waxed paper on work surface. Sprinkle waxed paper lightly with flour. Place dough disk in center of waxed paper and top with second sheet. Roll out dough to 1/4- to 3/8-inch thickness. Using 2-inch fluted cookie cutter, cut out cookies. Transfer to large baking sheet. Gather scraps, reroll, and cut out additional cookies. Press 1 pecan half into center of each cookie. Refrigerate cookies 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 325°F. Bake cookies until lightly browned, about 20 minutes. Cool on rack. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.)

Combine cream, milk, and sugar in a medium saucepan. Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add bean. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, stirring to dissolve sugar.
Remove pan from heat; cover and let stand for 30 minutes to let flavors meld. Whisk egg yolks in a medium bowl to blend. Gradually add cream mixture, whisking constantly. Return mixture to saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until thickened, 5-7 minutes.
Strain custard through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl set in a bowl of ice water. Let cool completely, stirring occasionally.

Add celery stalk, carrot, and onion. Bring to boil. Reduce heat; simmer uncovered until beans are tender, about 1 hour. Remove from heat. Add 1 teaspoon coarse salt; let beans cool in cooking liquid. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and chill in cooking liquid. Before using, drain beans, reserving 1/4 cup cooking liquid.
Lightly butter 1-quart baking dish. Combine crab, cheddar cheese, mayonnaise, mustard, lemon juice, and Worcestershire sauce in medium bowl; chill.
Melt butter in large saucepan over medium heat. Add shallots; sauté until soft, about 3 minutes. Add chopped celery, garlic, and cayenne; stir 2 minutes.

Ingredient tip: Crescenza cheese is a soft-ripened cow’s-milk cheese traditionally made in Italy. Look for it at your local cheese store, or order it online from bellwethercheese.com or mozzco.com.
What to drink: Try a crisp California Chardonnay with the appetizers. We like the Cakebread Cellars 2007 Napa Valley Chardonnay ($39). It’s bright and fruity, with notes of lemon zest and pear. The Napa Valley winery, which was founded in 1973, is currently run by four members of the Cakebread family.

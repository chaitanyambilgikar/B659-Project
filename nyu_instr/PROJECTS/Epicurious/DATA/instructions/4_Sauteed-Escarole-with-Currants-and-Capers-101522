Preheat oven to 350°F.
In a shallow baking pan toast nuts in middle of oven until golden, about 5 minutes. Cut escarole into 1-inch pieces and chop garlic.
In a 12-inch nonstick skillet sauté garlic in oil over moderately high heat, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add escarole in 3 batches, tossing each batch with tongs until wilted before adding next. Stir in currants, capers, and salt and pepper to taste and cook, covered, over moderately low heat until escarole is tender, about 3 minutes. Remove lid and cook over moderately high heat until most liquid is evaporated, about 2 minutes more. Stir in nuts.

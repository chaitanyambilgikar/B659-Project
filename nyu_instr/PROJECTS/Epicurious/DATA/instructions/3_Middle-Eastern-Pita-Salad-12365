In a sieve sprinkle the cucumber with a pinch of salt, let it drain for 20 minutes, and pat it dry. While the cucumber is draining, in a baking pan bake the pita pieces in the middle of a preheated 325°F oven, shaking the pan occasionally, for 18 to 20 minutes, or until they are golden brown and crisp, and let them cool slightly.
In a large bowl whisk together the oil, the lemon juice, the garlic, and the salt and pepper to taste, whisking until the dressing is emulsified, stir in the bell pepper, the tomato, the scallion, the parsley, the chopped mint, the pita pieces, the cucumber, and more salt and pepper to taste, and toss the salad to combine it well. Transfer the salad to a platter and garnish it with the romaine and the mint sprigs.

1. Top each apricot half with 2 tablespoons of the yogurt, drizzle with the honey, sprinkle with the pistachios, and serve.
2. While it's not necessary, if you want to give your plain (i.e., non-Greek) yogurt a thicker consistency, line a sieve with a paper coffee filter and set it over a bowl. Empty an 8-ounce container into the sieve, cover it loosely with plastic wrap, and place it in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours.

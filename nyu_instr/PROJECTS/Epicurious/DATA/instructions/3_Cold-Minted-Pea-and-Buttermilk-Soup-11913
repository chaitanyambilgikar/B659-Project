In a small saucepan simmer the peas in the broth, covered, for 10 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a blender, add the mint and the buttermilk, and purée the mixture until it is smooth. Transfer the soup to a bowl set in a larger bowl of ice and cold water and chill it, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes, or until it is cold.

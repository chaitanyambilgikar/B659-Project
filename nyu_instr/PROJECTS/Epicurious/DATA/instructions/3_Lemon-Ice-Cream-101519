With a vegetable peeler remove zest from lemon, being careful not to include any white pith. In a food processor blend zest with sugar until very finely ground. Squeeze enough juice from lemon to measure 1/4 cup. In a large bowl stir together sugar mixture and milk until sugar is dissolved and stir in lemon juice. In a medium bowl beat cream until it just holds stiff peaks and fold into milk mixture gently but thoroughly. Pour mixture into a 9 x 5 x 3-inch metal loaf pan. Freeze ice cream until frozen, about 3 hours, and up to 1 day.

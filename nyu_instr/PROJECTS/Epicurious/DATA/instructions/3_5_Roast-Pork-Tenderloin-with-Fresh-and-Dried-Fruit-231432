Preheat oven to 375°F. Sprinkle pork with 2 teaspoons rosemary, salt, and pepper. Heat oil in heavy large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Add pork (cut to fit, if necessary) and sauté until brown, turning occasionally, about 10 minutes. Using tongs, transfer pork to plate. Add shallots to skillet and sauté until brown, about 4 minutes. Add apples, kumquats, and cranberries; stir until fruit mixture is heated through, about 1 minute. Add broth, wine, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon rosemary. Boil 1 minute. Return pork and any juices to skillet, turning to coat with sauce.
Place skillet in oven and roast pork until thermometer inserted into center registers 145°F to 150°F, about 25 minutes. Transfer pork to platter; let stand 10 minutes. If thicker sauce is desired, boil juices in skillet until reduced enough to coat spoon. Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper. Slice pork crosswise and spoon sauce over.

1. Preheat oven to 250°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.
2. Using an electric mixer, beat the egg white until stiff and gradually add the sugar, salt, and desired spice. Beat until the mixture looks shiny. Stir in the nuts.
3. Using two spoons, place full teaspoons of the mixture on the sheet, leaving 1 1/2 inches between each cookie. Flatten out the tops.
4. Bake in the preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the cookies appear dry on top. Use a spatula to gently remove the warm cookies from the oven and cool on a wire rack. Store in a sealed jar.

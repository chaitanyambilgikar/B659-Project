Using mortar and pestle, mash garlic with salt until almost smooth. Transfer mixture to processor.
Whisk 6 tablespoons oil, lemon juice, egg yolks and 1 1/2 tablespoons water in small metal bowl. Set bowl over saucepan of barely simmering water (do not allow bowl to touch water). Whisk constantly until thermometer inserted into mixture registers 140°F for 3 consecutive minutes, about 9 minutes total. Cool slightly. Transfer to processor with garlic.
With machine running, gradually add remaining 3/4 cup oil in thin steady stream and blend until thick (if oil is added too quickly, mayonnaise will separate and become runny). Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to small bowl. (Aïoli can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.)
Place bowl of aïoli on platter. Surround with vegetables and eggs.

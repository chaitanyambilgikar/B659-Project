Position a rack in the upper third of the oven and a second rack in the lower third then preheat to 350°F.
In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda, and salt.
Place 1/2 cup sugar in a small bowl.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the remaining 1/2 cup sugar with the brown sugar, butter, and peanut butter and beat on medium speed, scraping the bowl occasionally, until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the egg and vanilla or almond extract and beat on medium until fully incorporated, about 1 minute. With the mixer on low, add the flour mixture and stir until just combined. Roll the dough into walnut-size balls, roll in sugar, and arrange on baking sheets, leaving about 2 inches between cookies. Bake, switching the cookies between the upper and lower racks about halfway through baking, until just starting to brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove the cookies from the oven and press a chocolate kiss into the center of each. Cool the cookies on baking sheets for 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. Continue baking cookies on cooled baking sheets. DO AHEAD: The cookies can be baked ahead and stored, in an airtight container at room temperature, up to 3 days.

Combine 2 1/2 cups water, lentils, diced carrots and bay leaf in heavy medium saucepan. Bring to boil. Reduce heat, cover and simmer until lentils are just tender, about 25 minutes. Drain; transfer to large bowl. Cool.
Mix all remaining ingredients into lentils. Season to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 4 hours ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)

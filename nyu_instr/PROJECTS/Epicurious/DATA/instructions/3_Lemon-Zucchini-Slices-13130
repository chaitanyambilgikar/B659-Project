Preheat oven to 400°F.
In a large bowl toss zucchini slices with oil until coated. Spread zucchini slices in one layer in a shallow baking pan and bake in middle of oven 5 minutes. Turn slices and sprinkle with salt to taste. Bake slices 3 to 5 minutes more, or until just translucent and tender. Sprinkle zucchini with lemon juice.

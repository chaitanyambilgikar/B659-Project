1. Place the vanilla wafer cookies, rounded sides down, on wire racks set on top of baking sheets. Place 1/2 teaspoon of marmalade on the flat side of each cookie.
2. Place the white chocolate chips in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave on high, stirring once or twice, until just melted, 1 to 2 minutes depending on the strength of your microwave. Stir until smooth. (Alternatively, place water to a depth of 1 inch in the bottom of a double boiler or a large saucepan and bring to a bare simmer. Place the white chocolate chips in the top of the double boiler or in a stainless steel bowl big enough to rest on top of the saucepan without touching the water. Heat, whisking occasionally, until the chocolate is just melted. Remove from the heat and whisk until smooth.)
3. Use a small offset spatula to spread white chocolate over each cookie, covering the marmalade and coming to the edges. Place the baking sheets in the refrigerator for 5 minutes to allow the chocolate to set.
White Chocolate and Marmalade Vanilla Wafers will keep, layered between parchment paper, at room temperature in an airtight container for up to 3 days.

Pour juices from cherries into glass cup. Add kirsch. Add enough red wine to measure 1 cup. Stir 3 tablespoons sugar and 1 tablespoon cornstarch in heavy small saucepan until no lumps remain. Gradually whisk in wine mixture, then cherries. Cook over medium-high heat until sauce boils, thickens and is translucent, stirring frequently, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in almond extract. (Sauce can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Rewarm over low heat before serving.)
Divide vanilla ice cream among bowls. Spoon warm sauce over and serve immediately.

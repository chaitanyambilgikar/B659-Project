Stuff to Do: Boil the potato in 2 cups of water until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain, save the broth, and set the potato aside.
Melt the butter in a soup pot on medium heat.
Add the leek, half the carrots, the ginger, thyme, nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Sauté for 5 minutes, stirring with a wooden spoon.
Add the celery, the remaining carrots, the cooked potato, and the potato broth.
Add 1 cup water, and stir.
Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, covered, until the carrots are tender, about 20 minutes.
In a blender or a bowl, blend or mash 2 cups of the soup with the milk until thick and silky smooth.
Return the blended soup to the soup pot, and stir.
Ladle into bowls and garnish.

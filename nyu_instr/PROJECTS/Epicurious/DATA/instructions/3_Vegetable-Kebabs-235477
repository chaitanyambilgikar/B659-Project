Make vinaigrette: Whisk together all vinaigrette ingredients in a glass measure until combined.
Skewer and grill vegetables: Toss zucchini in a large bowl with 2 teaspoons oil, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 3/4 teaspoon black pepper. Repeat with remaining vegetables, working with 1 type at a time and keeping each batch separate. Thread vegetables onto skewers (thread zucchini and eggplant horizontally through slices so cut sides will lie flat on grill; leave about 3/4 inch between tomatoes, mushrooms, bell peppers, and onions), using 3 skewers per type of vegetable and not mixing vegetables on any skewer.
Prepare grill for cooking over medium-hot charcoal (moderate heat for gas).
Grill kebabs in 2 batches on lightly oiled grill rack, covered only if using gas grill, turning over once, until vegetables are tender (vegetables, except tomatoes, should be lightly browned; tomatoes should be blistered and shriveled), 6 to 10 minutes (timing will vary among vegetables).
Transfer skewers as cooked to a platter and, if desired, remove vegetables from skewers. Drizzle with some of vinaigrette and serve remaining vinaigrette on the side.

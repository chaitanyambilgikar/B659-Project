Working with 1 slice of prosciutto at a time, cut prosciutto crosswise into 3 rectangles. Space prosciutto pieces 2 inches apart on work surface. Arrange 3 arugula leaves side by side atop each prosciutto piece, allowing tops to extend 1 inch over 1 long side of prosciutto. Top each with about 1 teaspoon cheese. Press generous 1/2 teaspoon currants into cheese atop each prosciutto piece. Starting at 1 short end of each prosciutto piece, roll up tightly, jelly-roll style. Transfer to platter. (Can be made 4 hours ahead. Cover rolls tightly and refrigerate.)

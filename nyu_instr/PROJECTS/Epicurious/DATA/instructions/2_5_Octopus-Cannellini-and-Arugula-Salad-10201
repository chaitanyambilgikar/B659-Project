Cut tentacles from octopus and discard head. In a large kettle combine octopus, carrots, onion, parsley, peppercorns, cloves, bay leaf, and halved celery rib with water to cover. Bring water to a boil and simmer, covered, 40 minutes, or until octopus is tender. Remove kettle from heat and cool mixture 30 minutes.
While octopus is cooking and cooling, in a saucepan simmer beans in 4 cups water, covered, 45 minutes, or until tender, and remove pan from heat. Cool beans in cooking liquid and drain.
Transfer octopus with tongs to a colander and rinse gently under cold water to remove as much of purple outer coating as possible without removing suction cups. Drain octopus and cut into 1 1/2-inch-long pieces. In a bowl, combine octopus and beans. Salad may be prepared up to this point 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.
Chop enough arugula (preferably larger leaves) to measure about 1/2 cup.
In a large bowl toss together octopus and beans, chopped and whole arugula, celery slices, lemon juice, oil, red pepper flakes, and salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.

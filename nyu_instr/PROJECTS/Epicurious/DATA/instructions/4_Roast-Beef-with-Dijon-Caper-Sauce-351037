For roast beef: Sprinkle beef with 1/2 teaspoon salt; let stand 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 350°F. Mix thyme, basil, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in small bowl. Heat oil in large oven-proof skillet over medium-high heat. Add beef; cook until browned on all sides, turning occasionally, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle with herb mixture. Transfer skillet to oven. Roast until instant-read thermometer inserted into center of meat registers 130°F, about 40 minutes. Transfer to cutting board; let rest.
For sauce: Place skillet with juices over medium-high heat. Add butter; stir until melted. Add flour; whisk until smooth. Gradually whisk in broth; bring to boil. Boil until sauce is reduced to 1 1/4 cups, whisking often, about 6 minutes. Whisk in mustard and capers. Season sauce with pepper.
Cut beef crosswise into very thin slices. Transfer beef to platter. Serve with sauce.
Test-kitchen tip: Eye of round is not the most tender cut of beef. For the best flavor and texture, be sure to slice it very thinly.
What to drink: With the beef, pour a full-bodied Syrah blend. One to try: Château de Jau 2007 "Le Jaja de Jau" ($11).

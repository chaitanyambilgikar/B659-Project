Preheat oven to 325°F. and generously butter a 9-inch round cake pan.
In a food processor, pulse nuts and granulated sugar just until ground fine (do not grind to a paste).
In a bowl with an electric mixer, beat butter with confectioners' sugar until light and fluffy. In another bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, salt, nut mixture and 1/4 cup coconut. Beat flour mixture into butter mixture until just combined.
On a lightly floured surface, knead dough 5 to 8 times, or until it just comes together. With floured hands (dough will be sticky) press dough evenly into prepared baking pan and sprinkle with remaining 5 tablespoons coconut,pressing lightly to make it adhere. Bake shortbread in middle of oven 30 minutes, or until pale golden.
While shortbread is still warm, loosen edges from pan with a small knife and cut into 8 wedges. Let shortbread cool in pan. Carefully transfer shortbread to a platter.

Brown the chicken pieces in the butter, turning each piece to color evenly. When the pieces are evenly browned, add 2 tablespoons finely chopped onion to the pan and let it cook down over low heat for 3-4 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste, 1/2 teaspoon thyme, and 2/3 cup white wine. Simmer gently until chicken is tender. Add 1/2 cup white wine and 1 tablespoon paprika and cook slowly for a few minutes. Remove chiken to a hot platter and reduce pan juices over high heat. Add 1 cup heavy cream, heat through and blend. Thicken sauce with beurre manié and taste for seasoning. Pour sauce over chicken and garnish with a good sprinkling of paprika and finely chopped parsley. Serve with a rice pilaf and a crisp salad.

In a Dutch oven or a heavy pot, combine the garlic, cumin, mustard seeds, and chickpeas. Seasons liberally with kosher salt and pepper, and barley cover with blended oil. Cover the pot and cook at 325°F until aromatic but not browned, about 45 minutes.
When the mixture is cool, transfer it, with all the oil, to a sterilized glass container and use as you like. If the chickpeas are covered with oil, the confit will last for at least 3 weeks in the refrigerator. Always save the oil for another use, for example, in a cumin vinaigrette or for sautéing.

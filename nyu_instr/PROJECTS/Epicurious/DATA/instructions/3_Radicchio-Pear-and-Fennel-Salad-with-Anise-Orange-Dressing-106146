Make dressing: Whisk together all dressing ingredients in a large bowl until combined well.
Make salad: Tear enough fennel fronds, if using, into small sprigs to measure 1/2 cup. Trim fennel stalks flush with bulb and discard stalks. Cut out and discard core of bulb, then cut bulb lengthwise into thin strips. Peel and core pears, then cut into 3-inch-long matchsticks. Add fennel strips and fronds to dressing along with pears and radicchio and toss well.

Cut 2 or 3 thin slices from tip of jalapeño (wear rubber gloves) and reserve for garnish. In a saucepan simmer tomatillos and remaining jalapeño in water to cover until tomatillos are tender, about 5 minutes, and transfer tomatillos, jalapeño, and 1/4 cup cooking liquid to a blender or food processor. Blend salsa until chopped but not completely smooth and transfer to a serving bowl. Cool salsa and chill, covered, until cold. Salsa may be prepared up to this point 2 days ahead and chilled, covered.
Just before serving, stir coriander, all but 1 teaspoon onion, and salt to taste into salsa. In a small bowl stir sour cream until smooth and spoon into center of salsa. Garnish sour cream with coriander sprig, reserved jalapeño, and remaining onion and serve with chips.

Preheat oven to 350°F.
On a baking sheet in middle of oven toast pistachios in one layer until golden, about 10 minutes. Once pistachios have cooled, coarsely chop.
In each of two 3-quart saucepans bring 2 1/4 cups water and 1/2 teaspoon salt to a boil. Stir 1 box couscous into each pan and let stand, covered, off heat 5 minutes.
Chop mint leaves. Fluff couscous with a fork and transfer to a bowl. Stir in pistachios, mint, oil, and lemon juice and season with salt and pepper.

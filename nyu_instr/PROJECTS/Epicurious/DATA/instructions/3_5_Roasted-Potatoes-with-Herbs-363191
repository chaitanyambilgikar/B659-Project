Preheat oven to 375°F. Using garlic press, squeeze garlic into large bowl. Whisk in oil and herbs. Add potatoes; toss to coat.
Spread potatoes in single layer on large rimmed baking sheet. Sprinkle generously with coarse salt and freshly ground black pepper. Roast until tender and brown, stirring occasionally, about 1 hour 15 minutes.
Place potatoes in bowl; top with parsley.

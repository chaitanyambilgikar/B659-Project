Bring beans, onion, cilantro sprigs, oil, and water to a boil in a 2-quart heavy pot. Reduce heat and simmer, partially covered, until beans are just tender, about 1 1/4 hours. Add salt and simmer, uncovered, until liquid is evaporated to just below level of beans. Season with salt and discard cilantro sprigs.

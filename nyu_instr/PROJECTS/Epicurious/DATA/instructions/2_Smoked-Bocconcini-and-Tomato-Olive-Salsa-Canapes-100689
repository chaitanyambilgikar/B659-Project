Preheat oven to 325°F. Cut baguette crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices and arrange in one layer on a large baking sheet. Lightly brush slices with oil and season with salt. Toast slices in middle of oven 15 minutes, or until golden, and transfer to a rack to cool completely. Toasts may be made 4 days ahead and kept in a sealable plastic bag at room temperature.
Make salsa: Seed tomatoes and cut into 1/4-inch dice. Pit and chop olives. Finely chop parsley and shallot. In a bowl stir together all salsa ingredients and salt to taste. Lightly rub toasts with garlic cloves. If using bocconcini, cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices.
To assemble canapés: Top each toast with a mozzarella slice and some salsa and garnish with parsley. Canapés may be made 1 hour ahead and chilled, covered.
Serve canapés at room temperature.

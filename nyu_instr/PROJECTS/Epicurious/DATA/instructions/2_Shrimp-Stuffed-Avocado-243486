1. Toss the shrimp with the tomatoes in a large bowl.
2. Squeeze the lime juice in another bowl. With a small melon baller, remove 6 balls from each avocado half. Toss in the lime juice and drain. Rub the exposed avocado halves with lime juice. Set aside.
3. Add the melon and avocado balls to the shrimp. Combine the mayonnaise, sour cream, and chopped cilantro. Fold into the shrimp. Season with salt and pepper.
4. Fill each avocado half evenly with the salad and garnish with a sprig of cilantro.

Cook cauliflower florets in large pot of boiling salted water until tender, about 6 minutes. Drain and transfer cauliflower to bowl. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in same pot over medium-high heat. Add spinach and toss until just wilted but still bright green, about 3 minutes. Transfer spinach to sieve set over large bowl and drain well. Reserve pot. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in reserved pot. Add half of shallot; saute 1 minute. Sprinkle cauliflower with cinnamon, salt, and pepper. Add to pot and toss to coat. Add spinach and toss until heated through, about 3 minutes. Divide vegetables among 6 plates.
Meanwhile, heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in medium skillet over high heat. Sprinkle scallops with salt and pepper. Add to skillet; sear until just opaque in center, about 2 minutes per side. Place 1 scallop on each plate. Melt butter in same skillet. Add half of shallot and last 3 ingredients. Cook until butter starts to brown, about 4 minutes. Spoon over scallops and serve.
WHAT TO DRINK: Bright fruit and honey flavors pair well with these three salty mezes. Try Boutari 2005 "Kallisti" (Santorini, $24).

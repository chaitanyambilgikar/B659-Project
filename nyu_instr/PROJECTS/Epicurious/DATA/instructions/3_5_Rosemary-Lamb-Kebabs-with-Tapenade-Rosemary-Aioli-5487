Whisk wine, oil, rosemary and garlic to blend in 13 x 9 x 2-inch glass baking dish. Season with salt and pepper. Add lamb and toss to coat with marinade. Let stand at room temperature 2 hours or cover and refrigerate overnight.
Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Thread lamb alternately with onion wedges onto skewers. Grill lamb kebabs to desired doneness, turning frequently, about 12 minutes for medium-rare. Transfer kebabs to plates. Serve with Tapenade-Rosemary Aioli.

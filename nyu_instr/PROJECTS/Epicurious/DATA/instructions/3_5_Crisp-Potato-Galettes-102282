Preheat oven to 400°F. Lightly coat a large baking sheet with cooking spray.
Peel potato and cut crosswise into paper-thin slices with a mandoline or other manual slicer. Overlap 8 to 10 slices on baking sheet to form a 4-inch round and make 7 more rounds in the same manner. Spray rounds lightly with cooking spray and season with salt and pepper.
Bake until golden brown and crisp, 15 to 20 minutes, and season with salt.

Bring a small pot of water to a gentle simmer over medium heat. Combine the coffee, chocolate and rum, if using, in a medium metal bowl that can sit atop the pot of water without touching the water. Place the bowl on the pot and heat until the chocolate is melted, stirring often. When the mixture is smooth, remove from the heat and set aside to cool until no longer warm to the touch.
Whip the cream at high speed to speed to soft peaks, about 1 minutes.
Fold half of the cream into the chocolate until combined but not fully incorporated and some streaks remain. Add the remaining cream in two batches, mixing to fully incorporate when the last batch is added.
If you want to serve it on its own, you can our it into dessert dishes to set or leave it in the bowl to scoop when you're ready to serve. Refrigerate until set, at least 1 hour, or up to 48 hours.

Heat butter in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until foam subsides, then sauté onion, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in cabbage, salt, and 1/2 cup water and cook, covered, stirring occasionally, until cabbage is just tender, about 12 minutes. Transfer to a serving dish.
Whisk together mustard, horseradish, and flour in skillet, then add remaining 1/2 cup water and whisk until combined well. Simmer 2 minutes, then stir into cabbage. Season with salt and pepper.

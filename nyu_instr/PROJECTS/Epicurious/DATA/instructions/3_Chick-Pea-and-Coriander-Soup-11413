Make cumin pita crouton-crisps: Preheat oven to 400°F.
Cut pita halves into 1/3 inch strips and in a small bowl toss with oil until coated evenly. Add cumin and salt and toss until spices adhere.
In a shallow baking pan spread pita strips in one layer and bake in middle of oven 3 minutes, or until crisp and golden. Crouton-crisps keep in an airtight container 2 weeks.
Serve crouton-crisps in soups, salads, or as a snack. Makes about 2 cups.
Make soup: In a 3 quart heavy saucepan cook onion in olive oil over moderate heat, stirring, until softened and golden brown. Add water, chick-peas, garlic, and salt and simmer, uncovered, 15 minutes. In a blender purée chick-pea mixture and coriander with lemon juice until smooth.
Serve soup topped with pita crouton-crisps.

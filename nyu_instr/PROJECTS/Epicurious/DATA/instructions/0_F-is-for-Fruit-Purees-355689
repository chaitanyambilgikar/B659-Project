1. Preheat the oven to 400°F. Sprinkle a pinch of cinnamon, if using, on each apricot half and place flesh down on a glass baking dish. Pour in the water and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until the flesh is very soft when pierced with a fork.
2. Remove the skin from the flesh with a knife. Using a handheld immersion blender, a blender, or a food processor, puree the fruit and add some or all of the pan juices until the desired consistency is reached. Serve at room temperature.

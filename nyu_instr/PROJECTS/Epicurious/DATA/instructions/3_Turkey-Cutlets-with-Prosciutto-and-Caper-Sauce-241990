Make sauce: Chop garlic and capers together. Transfer to a bowl and stir in oil, vinegar, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and a pinch of salt.
Prepare turkey: Drape a slice of prosciutto over each of 4 cutlets, covering them, then top with another cutlet (like a sandwich).
Put flour, eggs, and bread crumbs in separate shallow bowls, then stir 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and pepper into both flour and bread crumbs. Dredge each cutlet "sandwich" in flour, then eggs, then bread crumbs, shaking off excess after each dip. Transfer to a plate.
Heat oils in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium heat until oil shimmers, then cook cutlet sandwiches 2 at a time, turning once, until golden and just cooked through, 4 to 6 minutes per batch. Serve with caper sauce.

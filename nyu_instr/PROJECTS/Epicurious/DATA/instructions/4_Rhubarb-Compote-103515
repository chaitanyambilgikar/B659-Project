Place the rhubarb and the water in a heavy-bottomed stockpot over medium-high heat. Bring the water to a boil, stir, cover the pot and cook until the rhubarb is beginning to soften and give up its liquid, about 10 minutes. Stir in the sugar, cover partially and continue cooking until the rhubarb is completely melted and soft, checking it from time to time to be sure it isn't sticking to the bottom of the pan, about 40 minutes. Remove the compote from the heat and let cool before serving.

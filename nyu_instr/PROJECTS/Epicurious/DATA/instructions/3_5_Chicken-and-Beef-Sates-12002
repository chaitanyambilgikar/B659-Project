In a baking pan soak skewers in warm water 20 minutes. While skewers are soaking, in a blender blend cream, spices, salt, onion, and garlic. Cut chicken and beef crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick strips and in a bowl toss with cream mixture. Marinate chicken and beef, covered, at room temperature 15 minutes.
Preheat broiler. Thread some chicken and beef strips lengthwise, without bunching, onto each skewer (using three fourths of skewer) and discard any remaining marinade. Broil satés on well-oiled rack of a broiler pan as close to heat as possible, turning once, 2 to 3 minutes on each side, or until just cooked through.

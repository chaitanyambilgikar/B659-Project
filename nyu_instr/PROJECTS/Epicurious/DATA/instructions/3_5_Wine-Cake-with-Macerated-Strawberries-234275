Make cake: Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350°F.
Whisk together matzo cake meal, potato starch, and salt in a bowl. Stir together wine and lemon juice in another bowl or a glass measure.
Beat yolks in a large bowl with an electric mixer at medium-high speed until smooth, then add zest. Add 1 cup sugar gradually, beating, and beat until mixture is very thick and pale, 2 to 3 minutes.
With mixer at low speed, add half of matzo cake meal mixture to yolks, then all of wine mixture. Add remaining matzo meal mixture, mixing until just combined.
Beat whites with a pinch of salt in another bowl with cleaned beaters at medium speed until they hold soft peaks. Add remaining 1/4 cup sugar a little at a time, beating, and beat until whites just hold stiff peaks. Fold one fourth of whites into yolk mixture to lighten, then fold in remaining whites gently but thoroughly.
Pour batter into ungreased tube pan and rap pan firmly three times on work surface to eliminate any large air bubbles.
Bake spongecake until top is golden and springs back when it is pressed gently, 35 to 40 minutes. Immediately turn pan upside down on a rack and cool completely, about 1 hour. Run a knife around inner and outer edges of cake to loosen, then remove from pan.
Macerate strawberries: While cake cools, gently stir together strawberries, wine, and sugar until sugar is dissolved, then let stand at least 30 minutes.

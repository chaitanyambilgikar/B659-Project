Cut off artichoke stem and discard. Cut off top inch of artichoke with a serrated knife. Bend back outer leaves until they snap off close to base, then discard several more layers of leaves in same manner until you reach pale yellow leaves with pale green tips.
Cut remaining leaves flush with top of artichoke bottom with a sharp knife, then pull out purple leaves and scoop out fuzzy choke with melon-ball cutter. Rub cut surfaces with a lemon half. Trim remaining dark green fibrous parts from base and sides of artichoke with a sharp paring knife, then rub cut surfaces with same lemon half.
Trim mushroom stem flush with cap, then rub mushroom with same lemon half. Squeeze 1/2 teaspoon juice from remaining lemon half into a bowl. Shave artichoke and mushroom as thinly as possible with slicer and toss immediately with lemon juice, then with oil, parsley, salt, and pepper.
Shave a few pieces of cheese on top of salads with slicer or a vegetable peeler, then drizzle with olive oil.

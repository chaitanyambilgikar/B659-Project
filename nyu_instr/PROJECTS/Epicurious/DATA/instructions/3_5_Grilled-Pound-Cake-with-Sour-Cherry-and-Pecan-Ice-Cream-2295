Place cherries in medium bowl. Pour 1 cup boiling water over. Let stand until softened, about 10 minutes. Drain and pat dry. Mix cherries and 1 tablespoon brandy in small bowl.
Place ice cream in large bowl. Mix in cherries, semisweet chocolate and pecans. Cover ice cream mixture. Freeze until firm, about 2 hours.
Prepare barbecue (medium heat). Cut pound cake into sixteen 1/2-inch slices. Brush both sides of each cake slice with melted butter. Grill slices until lightly toasted, about 30 seconds per side. Place 2 cake slices on each of 8 dessert plates. Place 1 scoop ice cream atop cake slices on each plate. Drizzle 1 1/2 teaspoons brandy over each serving.

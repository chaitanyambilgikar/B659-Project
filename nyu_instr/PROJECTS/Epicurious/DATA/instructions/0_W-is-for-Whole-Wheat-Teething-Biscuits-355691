1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Lightly grease a large cookie sheet. Combine the milk, yolk, oil, and vanilla in a medium bowl and whisk to blend. Add the flour, oats, wheat germ, cinnamon, sugar, and dry milk and stir together to make a stiff dough. 2 On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the dough to a 1/4-inch thick rectangle, and using a cookie cutter or glass with 3-inch rim, cut into cookies. Transfer to the prepared sheet, spacing 2 inches apart. Bake for 15 minutes, or until golden and firm.

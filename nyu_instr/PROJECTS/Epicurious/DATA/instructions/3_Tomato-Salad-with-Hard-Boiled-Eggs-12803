In a bowl toss the bread cubes with the butter and salt to taste, spread them in a jelly-roll pan, and bake them in a preheated 375°F. oven for 4 to 6 minutes, or until they are golden. In a bowl whisk together the vinegar, the oil, and salt and pepper to taste until the dressing is emulsified, add the tomatoes, the scallion green, the olives, and the croutons, and toss the salad until it is combined well. Divide the salad between 2 plates and top it with the egg slices.

SUSHI RICE: Wash and cook 3 cups Calrose rice. While still hot, season with Vinegar Sauce, or use packaged sushi mix such as Sushi!-No-Ko.
VINEGAR SAUCE: 1/2 cup Japanese rice vinegar
1/2 cup sugar
1 teaspoon salt
Cook until sugar dissolves. Cool. Sprinkle half of vinegar sauce over hot rice; mix gently. Add more vinegar sauce to taste. Or follow instructions on package mix.
SATO-SHOYU STYLE: Spam sliced or cubed.
SAUCE: 1/4 cup shoyu
1/4 cup sugar
1/4 cup mirin (Japanese sweet rice wine)
Bring sauce to a boil in a small pan. Add Spam, lower heat, and cook 2-3 minutes.
TO ASSEMBLE SUSHI: Cut a sheet of nori in half. Place nori on your left hand; add a small amount of rice. Add Spam and all or some of the other ingredients. Wrap nori around the filling and toll from left to right.

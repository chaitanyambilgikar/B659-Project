Spray 9-inch-diameter glass pie dish with nonstick spray. Arrange 3/4 of cookie dough in prepared dish (reserve remaining dough for another use). Press dough evenly onto bottom and up sides of dish, building high-standing dough edge on rim of dish. Sprinkle with 1/2 cup nuts; press nuts into dough. Pierce dough all over with toothpick. Freeze crust 1 hour.Position rack in bottom third of oven and preheat to 350°F. Fold 36-inch-long piece of foil lengthwise into thirds, forming 36x4-inch strip. Place pie dish on baking sheet. Stand foil strip snugly around dish, protecting outer edge of crust; secure overlap with paper clip. Bake crust until golden and dry to touch, about 25 minutes. Cool completely.
Meanwhile, whisk 1/3 cup sugar, cornstarch, and salt to blend in heavy medium saucepan. Whisk in yolks; gradually add milk, whisking until smooth. Whisk over medium-high heat until custard thickens and boils, about 6 minutes. Remove from heat. Whisk in butter, rum, and 1 teaspoon vanilla. Transfer to large bowl; cool to lukewarm, whisking occasionally, about 45 minutes.
Spread 1 cup custard in crust. Top with 3 sliced bananas, then remaining custard, covering bananas completely. Chill pie until filling sets, about 2 hours. Beat cream, powdered sugar and remaining 1 teaspoon vanilla in medium bowl to peaks. Spread cream over pie. Refrigerate at least 1 and up to 8 hours. Garnish pie with chocolate curls, if desired. Cut into wedges and serve.

1. Prepare the barbecue sauce ahead of time: Combine all of the sauce ingredients in a heavy saucepan. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring, to heat through and to blend the flavors, 10 to 12 minutes. Do not boil. Strain to remove the garlic. Cool to room temperature. (Makes 3 cups.) Use immediately or refrigerate, covered, for up to 2 weeks.
2. Preheat the oven to 350ºF.
3. Using a sharp knife, separate the chicken wings at the joint. Set aside.
4. Place the chicken pieces in a large bowl and toss well with 1 1/2 cups of the sauce. Lay the pieces in a single layer on 2 or 3 baking sheets (do not overcrowd them). Bake for 45 to 50 minutes, basting once or twice with additional sauce. Serve the wings on a platter and sprinkle with the scallions.

In a large heavy saucepan cook onion in butter over moderate heat, stirring, until softened. Add 2 cups broth, water, and barley and simmer, covered, until most of liquid is absorbed and barley is al dente, about 30 minutes. Gradually add remaining cup broth, about 1/4 cup at a time, stirring constantly and letting each addition be absorbed before adding next, until absorbed. Stir in remaining ingredients and remove pan from heat. Season "risotto" with salt and pepper.

Preheat the oven to 425°F. Lightly oil a small, rimmed baking sheet with extra-virgin olive oil or coat with nonstick cooking spray. Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper, and sprinkle with the rosemary.
Melt the butter with the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the chicken for 6 minutes or until browned on both sides, turning once. Transfer to the baking sheet. Add the apple slices to the skillet and cook over medium-high heat for 3 to 4 minutes, or until slightly softened and lightly browned. Spoon the apples around the chicken, placing a couple of slices over each breast.
Bake for 6 minutes or until the chicken feels slightly firm when pressed. Scatter the cheese over the chicken and apples. Continue baking another 2 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and the chicken is no longer pink in the center. Serve the chicken with the apples.

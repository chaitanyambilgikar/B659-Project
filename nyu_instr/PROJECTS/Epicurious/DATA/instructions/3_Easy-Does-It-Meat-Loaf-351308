1. Preheat the oven to 350°F.
2. Place the chuck, onion, parsley, 2 tablespoons of the chili sauce, the Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Toss together lightly.
3. Form the meat into a 3x5-inch oval loaf on a lightly greased rimmed baking pan. Brush the remaining tablespoon of chili sauce over the meat loaf. Bake for 30 minutes or until cooked through. Do not overbake. Let rest for 15 minutes so juices can settle. Cool to room temperature. Cover with foil and refrigerate overnight for sandwiches.

Preheat oven to 250°F.
Peel sweet potatoes and coarsely shred in a food processor fitted with large-holed disk, then toss with salt in a bowl.
Melt 1 tablespoon butter in an 8-inch nonstick skillet over moderate heat until foam subsides. Add one fourth of potatoes, spreading them evenly into a 6-inch round (without compacting), and cook, shaking skillet occasionally, until golden brown on underside, about 4 minutes. Flip potato cake over by covering skillet with flat lid of a pot (at least 8 inches in diameter), then inverting pancake onto lid. Slide cake back into skillet and cook until golden brown on underside, about 3 minutes more. Slide potato cake onto a baking sheet and keep warm in oven. Make 3 more potato cakes in same manner.

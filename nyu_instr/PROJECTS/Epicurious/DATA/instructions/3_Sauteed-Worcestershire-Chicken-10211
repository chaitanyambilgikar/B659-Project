Pat chicken dry and place between 2 sheets of plastic wrap. With a meat pounder flatten chicken lightly to about 1/2-inch thickness and season with salt and pepper.
In a large non-stick skillet heat oil over moderate heat and cook chicken, skin sides down, 6 minutes on each side. Add garlic, Worcestershire sauce, vinegar, broth, and oregano and simmer until chicken is cooked through, about 4 minutes. Transfer chicken with tongs to a platter and simmer sauce until reduced to about 1/4 cup. Add lemon juice and salt and pepper to taste.
Pour sauce over chicken.

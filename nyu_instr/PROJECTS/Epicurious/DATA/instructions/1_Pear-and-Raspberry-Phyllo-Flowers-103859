Preheat oven to 400°F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
Cut stack of phyllo sheets lengthwise into 4 equal stacks.
Cover phyllo stacks with 2 overlapping sheets of plastic wrap and then a damp kitchen towel (to keep phyllo moist).
Remove 3 strips from 1 stack and place separately on a work surface, then brush each strip with butter. Gather and pleat the long side of each strip to form a 3-inch ruffled fan.
Arrange 3 fans to form a 6-inch circle on 1 corner of baking sheet. Make 3 more circles in same manner and arrange on remainder of baking sheet.
Sprinkle each circle with 1/2 teaspoon sugar.
Repeat twice, adding 2 more layers of ruffled fans to each circle, sprinkling each layer with 1/2 teaspoon sugar. (Each flower will have 3 layers of ruffles.)
Arrange pear slices in 1 slightly overlapping layer on phyllo flowers, leaving a 1-inch border. Place 3 raspberries in center of each flower.
Sprinkle fruit with remaining 2 tablespoons sugar.
Bake flowers in middle of oven until phyllo is golden, 18 to 20 minutes. Using a wide spatula, carefully transfer to a rack to cool.

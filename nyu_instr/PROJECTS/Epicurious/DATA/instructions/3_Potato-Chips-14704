Peel potatoes and put in a bowl of cold water to cover. Pat 1 potato dry. Using a mandoline or other manual slices cut potato into paper-thin slices (about 1/16 inch thick) and let potato slices stand 5 minutes in another bowl of cold water to cover.
Drain potato slices and spread without overlapping on a triple layer of paper towels. Blot slices completely dry with another triple layer of paper towels.
In a 3-quart saucepan heat oil until a deep-fat thermometer registers 380°F. Working in batches of 8 to 10 slices, fry potatoes, turning once or twice, until golden, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, making sure oil returns to 380°F before adding next batch. Transfer chips as fried with a large slotted spoon to paper towels to drain and sprinkle with salt. Continue to pat dry, cut, dry, and fry remaining potatoes in same manner. Potato chips may be made 2 days ahead and kept in an airtight container.

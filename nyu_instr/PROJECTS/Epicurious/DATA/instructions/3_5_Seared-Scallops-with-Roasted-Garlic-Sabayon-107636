Preheat oven to 400°F. Cut top 1/4 inch off heads of garlic to expose cloves. Place garlic heads on large sheet of foil. Drizzle 1 teaspoon oil over garlic and wrap loosely but completely in foil; place packet directly on oven rack and roast until very soft, about 45 minutes. Cool. Squeeze garlic from skins into bowl. Using fork, mash roasted garlic until smooth.
Heat 3 teaspoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle scallops with salt and pepper. For sea scallops: Sear half at a time until brown and just opaque in center, about 1 minute per side. For bay scallops: Sauté half at a time until opaque, stirring frequently, about 1 1/2 minutes per batch. Transfer to plate. Tent with foil to keep warm.
Meanwhile, bring clam juice and vermouth to boil in small saucepan; remove from heat. Stir in lemon juice. Whisk egg yolks and 2 tablespoons roasted garlic puree in large metal bowl to blend. Gradually whisk in clam juice mixture. Place bowl over saucepan of simmering water (do not allow bowl to touch water) and whisk until sabayon is thick and creamy and thermometer registers 160°F, about 3 minutes. Remove bowl from over water. Whisk in parsley, tarragon, and chives. Season sabayon with salt and pepper.
Divide arugula among 4 warm plates; place scallops atop arugula. Spoon sabayon over scallops and serve.

Sprinkle roast with 1/2 teaspoon marjoram, salt, and pepper. Scatter onion, carrots, garlic cloves, and chopped meat around rack in pan. Drizzle vegetables with 1 tablespoon oil; sprinkle with 1 teaspoon marjoram. Roast pork until instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of meat (not stuffing) registers 150°F, stirring vegetables occasionally, about 1 hour 25 minutes. Transfer pork to cutting board; tent with foil to keep warm.

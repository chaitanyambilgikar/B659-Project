Smoked pork loin is a great delicacy. When purchasing it, ask how much cooking it needs. Some types require a full 30 minutes per pound at 300°F., while others, because they are hot-smoked and therefore practically cooked, require mere reheating, or about 12-15 minutes per pound at most.
Treat a smoked ham exactly like a fresh loin of pork. Baste with white wine or sherry during cooking. Remove from the oven, and allow to rest for 10 minutes before carving. Serve with buttered new potatoes and the sauerkraut given in Crown Roast of Pork with Sauerkraut.

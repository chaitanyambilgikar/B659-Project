Cook bacon in heavy Dutch oven over medium-high heat until almost crisp, about 4 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towels. Add onions, mushrooms and garlic to drippings in pot. Sauté until onions are tender and golden, about 10 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer vegetables to bowl.
Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper. Add to pot; sauté until brown, about 15 minutes. Return bacon and vegetables to pot. Add remaining ingredients; bring to boil. Reduce heat, cover and simmer until chicken is cooked through, about 30 minutes.
Using large spoon, skim fat from top of sauce. Season chicken to taste with salt and pepper and serve.

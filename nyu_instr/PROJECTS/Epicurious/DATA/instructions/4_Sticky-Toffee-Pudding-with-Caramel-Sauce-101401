Make sauce: Bring cream, brown sugar and butter to boil in heavy medium saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring frequently. Reduce heat and simmer sauce until reduced to 3 1/2 cups, stirring occasionally, about 6 minutes. Set aside. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Rewarm over medium-low heat, stirring frequently, before using.)
Make cake: Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter 12-cup Bundt pan. Whisk flour and baking powder in medium bowl to blend; set aside. Combine 1 1/2 cups water, dates and baking soda in another heavy medium saucepan and bring to boil. Remove from heat; cool completely.
Using electric mixer, beat butter and sugar in large bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs 1 at a time. Mix in vanilla and half of flour mixture, then date mixture. Blend in remaining flour mixture. Pour batter into prepared pan.
Bake until cake rises and is golden on top, about 45 minutes. Pour 3/4 cup caramel sauce over cake; continue baking until tester inserted near center of cake comes out with no crumbs (only caramel sauce) attached, about 15 minutes. Cool in pan 10 minutes. Invert cake onto platter. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cool completely. Wrap cake airtight and store at room temperature. Cover remaining caramel sauce and refrigerate. Rewarm sauce over medium-low heat, stirring frequently, before using.)
Cut cake into slices; drizzle caramel sauce over each slice.

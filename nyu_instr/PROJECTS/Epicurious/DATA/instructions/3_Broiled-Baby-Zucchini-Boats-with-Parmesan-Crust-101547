Preheat the broiler. Melt the butter in a large cast-iron skillet or something similar with an ovenproof handle. Add the garlic and sauté over medium-low heat for about 30 seconds, being careful to let the garlic brown.
Place the zucchini halves facedown in the garlic butter and sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper. Sauté over medium high heat for about 5 minutes, or until the zucchini are just slightly tender when poked with a fork.
Turn the zucchini over, and sprinkle generously with parmesan. (Don't worry if the parmesan spills into the pan. It will melt into additional, delicious crust.) Cook for just a minute or two longer, then transfer the skillet to the broiler.
Broil for about 3 to 5 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and golden brown. Serve hot, and don't forget to scrape up the spilled parmesan from the bottom of the pan.

Cut the cucumbers lengthwise into quarters and place in a large bowl. Dissolve the table salt in 4 cups of the water and pour over the cucumbers. Soak the cucumbers for about 20 minutes.
Combine the garlic, onion, Korean leeks, green onions, chile powder, and sea salt in another large bowl.
Remove the cucumbers from the salt water and rinse. Add the cucumbers to the spicy mixture and mix until the cucumbers are all well coated. Stuff the cucumbers into a 1/2-gallon glass jar, pressing firmly until filled.
Dissolve the sugar in the remaining 1/3 cup water and pour over the cucumbers. Cover tightly. Let sit in a cool, dark place for 2 to 3 days before opening to see if it's ripe. The cucumbers should be sour and have absorbed the salt and flavors of the seasoning. Refrigerate after opening. It will keep for almost 2 weeks in the refrigerator.

In large bowl, gently toss beets with 3 tablespoons oil and 2 teaspoons salt. Wrap each beet individually in aluminum foil and place on large rimmed baking sheet. Roast until tender, about 1 to 1 1/4 hours. Cool to warm in foil, about 20 minutes.
When beets are cool enough to handle, unwrap and peel, discarding stems and root ends. Cut beets into quarters and transfer to large bowl. Add orange juice, thyme, pepper, and remaining 3 tablespoons oil and 1 teaspoon salt. Gently toss to combine. Serve warm or at room temperature.

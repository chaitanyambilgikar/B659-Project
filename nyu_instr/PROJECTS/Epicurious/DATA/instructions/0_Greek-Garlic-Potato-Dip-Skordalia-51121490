1. Preheat the oven to 350°F oven.
2. On a heavy baking sheet, bake the potatoes until tender, about one hour. Remove from the oven and set aside until cool enough to handle.
3. While potatoes cool, using the flat side of a knife or in a mortar and pestle, crush the garlic and salt together into a fine paste.
4. Cut the cooled potatoes lengthwise, scoop out the pulp, and mash through a ricer, food mill, or potato masher, then place into a large mixing bowl. Add the garlic paste, egg yolk, black pepper, olives, almonds, lemon juice, and olive oil to the potatoes and mix well, until it has the consistency of mashed potatoes.
5. Adjust the consistency and taste with more olive oil, salt, and pepper, and serve.

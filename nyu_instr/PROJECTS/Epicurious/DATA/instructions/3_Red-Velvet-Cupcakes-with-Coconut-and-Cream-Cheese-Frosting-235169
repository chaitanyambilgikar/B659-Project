Preheat oven to 350°F. Line 18 muffin cups with paper liners. Sift flour and cocoa into small bowl. Using electric mixer, beat 1 1/2 cups sugar and 3/4 cup butter in large bowl until smooth. Beat in eggs 1 at a time, then red food coloring and 1 teaspoon vanilla. Mix in dry ingredients in 3 additions alternately with 2/3 cup buttermilk in 2 additions. Make well in center; pour in remaining 1/3 cup buttermilk, vinegar, and baking soda. When bubbles form, stir into batter.
Divide batter equally among paper liners. Bake cupcakes until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Cool 10 minutes; transfer to rack and cool completely.
Beat cream cheese, 1/4 cup butter, and remaining 1 teaspoon vanilla in medium bowl until smooth. Beat in powdered sugar; fold in 1 cup flaked coconut. Spread frosting on cupcakes, leaving 1/2-inch plain border; sprinkle with remaining 1 cup coconut.

For crust: Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter 10-inch-diameter springform pan. Wrap bottom with 2 layers of heavy-duty foil. Mix all ingredients in medium bowl to blend, crumbling almonds slightly. Press mixture onto bottom and 1 inch up sides of pan. Bake until set, about 7 minutes. Maintain oven temperature.
For filling: Combine almond paste, cream cheese, and sugar in processor; blend until smooth, occasionally scraping down sides of bowl, about 2 minutes. Mix in eggs until just blended. Pour filling into crust. Bake 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 325°F and bake until center is set and top appears dry, about 45 minutes longer. Cool. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate overnight. (Can be prepared 2 days ahead. Keep refrigerated.)
For apples: Toss apple slices with lemon juice in large bowl. Melt 3 tablespoons butter in heavy large skillet over high heat. Add apples and sauté until golden and tender, stirring frequently, about 9 minutes. Sprinkle with brown sugar and cinnamon. Stir to coat. Add remaining 1 tablespoon butter. Stir until coated and glazed. Cool slightly.
Run small sharp knife around edge of pan to loosen cheesecake. Release pan sides. Arrange apples (warm or room temperature) in concentric circles atop cheesecake. Brush apples with any juices left in skillet. Cut into wedges and serve.

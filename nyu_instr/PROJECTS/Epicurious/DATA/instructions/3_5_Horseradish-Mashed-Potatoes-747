Cook potatoes in large pot of boiling salted water until very tender, about 20 minutes. Drain.
Return potatoes to same pot. Add milk, butter and horseradish. Using electric mixer, beat potatoes until creamy. Season to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 2 hours ahead. Cover and let stand at room temperature. Rewarm over low heat, stirring constantly and thinning with more milk if necessary.)

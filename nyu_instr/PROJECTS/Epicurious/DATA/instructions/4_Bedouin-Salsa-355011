Heat a comal or dry 12-inch heavy skillet (preferably cast-iron; not nonstick) over medium-low heat until hot.
Cook garlic and jalapeños, turning with tongs occasionally, until blackened in spots, about 15 minutes. Cool slightly, about 15 minutes.
Combine all ingredients except parsley in a food processor and finely chop. Add parsley and pulse a few more times.

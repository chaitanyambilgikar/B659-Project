Soak the tongue in a bowl of cold water for 30 minutes to remove all the blood. Drain and place in a pot. Add enough fresh water to cover and bring to a boil, then drain and refresh under cold running water. Drain well.
Put the tongue back in the pot, cover again with water, and add the vegetables, herbs, peppercorns, and salt. Cut out a disk of parchment paper the same diameter as the pan, cut a hole in the center, and press it down onto the surface of the liquid, to keep the tongue submerged. Bring to a boil, then simmer gently for 1 hour and 40 minutes. Let the tongue cool in the liquid.
Once cool, peel the tongue by sliding a knife under the skin; if properly cooked it will pull off easily.

Cut kernels off cob. (You can eat fresh corn raw; it provides crunchiness.) In a large bowl, combine corn, tomatoes, onion, bell pepper, cucumber, broth, parsley, oil, salt, and black pepper. Cover and refrigerate 2 hours. Before serving, toast almonds (10 minutes in a 350°F oven). Serve soup cold and garnish with almonds and parsley.

1. Combine the tomatoes and olives in a small bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Dress with the vinegar, oil, and 1 tablespoon of the parsley. Set aside.
2. Preheat the broiler.
3. Broil the steak 4 inches from the heat source until browned, about 4 minutes on the first side. Turn over and cook for 3 minutes on the other side for medium-rare meat. Cook 1 minute longer for medium.
4. Let the meat rest 5 minutes before carving. Slice into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Arrange on a serving platter. Spoon the reserved tomato-olive salsa atop the steak and sprinkle with the remaining tablespoon of parsley. Serve immediately.

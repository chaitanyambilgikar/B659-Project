Preheat oven to 375°F.
Brush 2 large shallow (1-inch-deep) baking pans generously with some olive oil. Cut 1 potato crosswise into 1/16-inch-thick slices with Benriner and immediately arrange in 1 layer on baking sheets. Lightly brush slices with more oil and sprinkle with half of coarse salt and pepper.
Bake in upper and lower thirds of oven, switching position of sheets halfway through baking, until golden, 10 to 20 minutes (check frequently after 10 minutes), and transfer as cooked with a metal spatula to a rack to cool. Make more chips with remaining potato in same manner.

Pine Nut "Goat Cheese" Process all ingredients in a food processor until as smooth as possible.
You should have about 4 cups. Reserve 2 cups for the sauce, and set aside the remainder.
Rosemary-Cream Sauce Puree all the ingredients in a high-speed blender until smooth.
To Finish Using a mandoline, slice the beets very thin (so they are pliable and not stiff, approximately 1/16 of an inch or less).
Make small stacks of the larger pieces and use a sharp knife to cut into squares—the size doesn't matter much, as long as they are all roughly the same. Alternatively, use a round-, heart-or other- shaped cookie cutter to cut the slices. Cut at least 40 slices—10 per serving, with a few extra to spare.
In a medium bowl, place the beet slices, oil, lemon juice, and salt and toss gently to coat evenly. Allowing the beets to sit for a half hour or more will soften them; this is optional but a good idea if your slices are on the thicker side and still a bit stiff.
Lay half the beet slices on a clean work surface and top each with a rounded teaspoonful of the cheese. Top with the remaining beet slices and press down gently.
Spoon the sauce onto serving plates, and arrange the ravioli on top. Garnish with a few drops of aged balsamic vinegar and a few sprigs of either microgreens or fresh herbs.

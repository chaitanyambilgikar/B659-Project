Preheat oven to 350°F. Lightly butter eight 3/4-cup custard cups or soufflé dishes. Melt butter in heavy small skillet over medium heat. Add shallots and poblano chili; sauté until chili is tender, about 3 minutes.
Puree corn in processor. Add half and half and next 6 ingredients. Using on/off turns, process until mixture is smooth. Transfer to large bowl. Add crabmeat and chili mixture; stir to blend. (Can be made 8 hours ahead. Cover; chill.)
Divide custard among prepared cups. Sprinkle 1/2 tablespoon cheese over each. Place cups in large roasting pan. Pour enough hot water into pan to come halfway up sides of cups.
Bake until custards are set in center and knife inserted into center comes out clean, about 50 minutes.

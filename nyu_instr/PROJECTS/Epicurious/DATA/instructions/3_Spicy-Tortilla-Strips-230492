Put oven racks in upper and lower thirds of oven and preheat oven to 375°F.
Lightly brush 2 large baking pans with oil. Whisk 1/4 cup oil with spices and salt and brush 1 side of each tortilla with it. Make 3 (4-tortilla) stacks and cut stacks into 1/4-inch-wide strips. Arrange strips in 1 layer in baking pans. Bake, switching position of pans halfway through baking, until golden and crisp, 12 to 15 minutes. Season with salt and cool completely in pans.

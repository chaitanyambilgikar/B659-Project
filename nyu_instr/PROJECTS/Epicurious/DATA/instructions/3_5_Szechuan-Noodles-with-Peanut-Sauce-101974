Mix 1/2 cup vegetable broth, peanut butter, soy sauce, balsamic vinegar, chili-garlic sauce and minced garlic in medium bowl to blend well (sauce will be thick). Cook noodles in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite, about 6 minutes. Drain. Rinse noodles under cold water and cool. Cut noodles into 4- to 5-inch lengths. Transfer noodles to very large bowl. Toss with oil to coat.
Cut bok choy, peppers, carrots and onions into matchstick-size strips. (Sauce, noodles and vegetables can be prepared 4 hours ahead. Cover separately; chill. Bring sauce to room temperature before continuing, thinning with additional broth if necessary.)
Add shredded cabbage and vegetable strips to noodles. Toss with enough peanut sauce to coat. Sprinkle with sesame seeds.

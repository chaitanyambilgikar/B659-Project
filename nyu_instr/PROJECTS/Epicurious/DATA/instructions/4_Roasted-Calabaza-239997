Preheat oven to 475°F with racks in upper and lower thirds.
Seed and peel calabaza, then cut into 3/4-inch-wide pieces (about 3 inches long).
Toss with oil, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, and 3/4 teaspoon pepper, then divide between 2 large shallow heavy baking pans, spreading in 1 layer.
Roast calabaza, switching position of pans and turning calabaza over halfway through cooking, until tender and starting to caramelize, 35 to 45 minutes.

Cook fish bones and trimmings, onion, fennel, parsley sprigs, lemon juice, and salt in a well-buttered 4- to 6-quart heavy pot, covered, over moderate heat 5 minutes.
Add water and wine and bring to a boil, skimming froth. Simmer, uncovered, 20 minutes, then pour through a very fine sieve into a large bowl, discarding solids.

Spread the rounds on one side with mayonnaise and place the rounds mayonnaise-side up on the work surface. On half of the slices place an onion round, just the size of the brioche, and salt it well. Top with the remaining brioche rounds, mayonnaise side down. Roll the edges of each sandwich first in mayonnaise, and then in the chopped parsley.

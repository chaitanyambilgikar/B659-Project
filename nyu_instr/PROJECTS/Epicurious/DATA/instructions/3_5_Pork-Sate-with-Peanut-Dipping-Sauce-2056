Mix 1 tablespoon lemongrass, 1 tablespoon lime juice, 1 tablespoon sugar, soy sauce and garlic in large bowl. Add pork; toss to coat with marinade. Let stand 30 minutes to 1 hour.
Meanwhile, mix remaining 1/3 cup lemongrass, remaining 2 tablespoons lime juice, remaining 1 tablespoon sugar, 1 cup broth, peanut butter, onion, coriander and jalapeño in heavy medium saucepan. Bring to boil, whisking frequently. Transfer mixture to blender and puree. Strain into heavy small saucepan, pressing on solids with back of spoon; discard solids. Simmer until reduced to thick sauce consistency, stirring frequently, about 6 minutes. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Reheat before using, thinning with more chicken broth if necessary.)
Preheat broiler. Thread 3 pork strips on each skewer. Broil until cooked through, about 3 minutes per side. Pour sauce into bowl; set in center of platter. Sprinkle with green onion. Surround with pork skewers and serve.

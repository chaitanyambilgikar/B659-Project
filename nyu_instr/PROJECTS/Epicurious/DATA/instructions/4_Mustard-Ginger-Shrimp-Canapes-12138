In a saucepan whisk together the vinegar, the oil, the sugar, the Worcestershire sauce, the Tabasco, the mustard, the gingerroot, and salt and pepper to taste, bring the mixture to a boil, and simmer it, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. Add the shrimp and simmer them, stirring occasionally, for 3 to 5 minutes, or until they are cooked through. Transfer the mixture to a heatproof bowl, add the bell peppers, tossing the mixture well, and chill the mixture, covered, for 2 hours. Drain the mixture, discarding the liquid, and stir in the chopped coriander, the red pepper flakes, and salt and pepper to taste. Arrange a shrimp and several pepper strips on each pita wedge and garnish the canapés with the coriander sprigs.

1. Preheat oven to 325°F.
2. In a mixing bowl, combine the whole and ground flaxseed, flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar.
3. Add the butter and mix on medium speed with the paddle attachment until the mixture has the consistency of coarse crumbs.
4. Fold in the walnuts, figs, and soy milk, and mix until the dough is smooth.
5. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and chill for 10 minutes.
6. On a floured surface, roll out half of the dough to 1/8 inch thick or thinner. Cut it as if on a grid to form 2-inch squares, then transfer them to an ungreased baking sheet with a spatula. Repeat with the other half of the dough.
7. Bake the crackers until golden brown, approximately 20 minutes. Let cool, then serve.

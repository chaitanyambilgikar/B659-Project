In a large saucepan bring the broth just to a boil and in it poach the chicken at a bare simmer for 15 minutes, or until the chicken is just cooked through. Remove the pan from the heat and let the chicken cool in the broth. Transfer the chicken to a cutting board, reserving the broth, and discard the skin and bones. Shred the chicken and reserve it, covered and chilled. In a large heavy saucepan cook the onion in the oil over moderate heat, stirring, until it is softened, stir in the carrots and the zucchini, and cook the mixture, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the reserved broth to the vegetable mixture with the chick-peas and simmer the soup for 8 minutes, or until the carrots are just tender. The soup and the chicken may be prepared up to this point 1 day in advance and kept covered and chilled. Stir the reserved chicken into the soup with the chilies and salt and pepper to taste, simmer the soup gently until the chicken is heated through, and divide it among 8 bowls. Garnish each serving with some of the avocado, peeled, pitted, and sliced, and a lime wedge.

Make soup: Peel potato and cut into 1/4-inch dice. In a heavy kettle cook potato, parsnips, shallots, leek and parsley in butter over moderate heat, stirring, until leek is softened, about 12 minutes. Add broth and simmer, covered, 20 minutes, or until vegetables are very soft. In a blender purée mixture in batches and transfer to a large saucepan. Stir in cider or juice, cream, and salt and pepper to taste and cook over moderately high heat, stirring occasionally, until heated through. Keep soup warm.
Make fried parsnip: In a heavy saucepan heat 1 inch oil to 360°F. on a deep-fat thermometer and fry parsnip strips in batches until golden brown, transferring with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain. Season fried parsnip with salt.
Serve soup topped with fried parsnip.

With a fork pierce meat side of ribs all over. In a small bowl stir together spices and rub all over ribs. Put ribs in a shallow baking dish.
In bowl stir together Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce or tamari, and sugar and brush mixture over ribs. Marinate ribs, meat sides down, covered and chilled, at least 3 hours and up to overnight.
Preheat oven to 300°F.
Put ribs, meat sides up, in a roasting pan large enough to hold them in one layer and roast in middle of oven, turning occasionally, 1 1/2 hours, or until cooked through. Cut ribs into sections.

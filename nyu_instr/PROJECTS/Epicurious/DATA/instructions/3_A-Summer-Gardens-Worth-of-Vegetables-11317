1. Bring 3 cups of water to a boil in the bottom of a steamer. Steam the new potatoes until they are just tender through, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from the steamer and reserve. Add the green beans to the steamer and steam until they are nearly tender through but still have their bright green color, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from the steamer and reserve. Add the onions and the carrots and steam until both are nearly tender through, about 5 minutes. Remove from the steamer and reserve.
2. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil, add the peas, return to the boil and cook until the peas are sweet and tender but not quite cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes. Strain the peas and reserve.
3. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a heavy skillet over medium heat. Add the potatoes and toss until they are coated with oil, then add the remaining vegetables except for the peas and cook, tossing occasionally, until the vegetables are completely hot through, about 10 minutes. Add the peas and cook, tossing constantly, until they are hot through. Transfer the vegetables to a large, warmed serving bowl. Quickly mince the herbs and sprinkle over the vegetables, along with the fleur de sel and the remaining tablespoon of olive oil. Toss quickly and serve.

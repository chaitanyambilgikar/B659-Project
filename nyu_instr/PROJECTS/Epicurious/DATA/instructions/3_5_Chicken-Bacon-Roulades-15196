Thinly slice shallots. In a 12-inch ovenproof heavy skillet cook bacon in batches over moderate heat, turning it, until golden but still flexible (not crisp) and drain on paper towels. In fat remaining in skillet cook shallots over moderately low heat, stirring, until softened. Transfer shallots with a slotted spoon to a small bowl and leave any fat remaining in skillet. Preheat oven to 300°F.
Put each chicken breast half between 2 sheets of plastic wrap and with smooth side of a meat pounder pound each breast to 1/8-inch thickness. Discard plastic from boned side of each breast and season chicken with lemon pepper and salt. Arrange 2 1/2 bacon slices lengthwise (parallel with grain of flesh) along middle of each breast and top with shallots and Parmesan. Using plastic wrap as an aid, tightly roll up each breast lengthwise, tucking in ends to enclose filling, and secure seams with wooden picks.
Add oil to reserved fat in skillet and heat over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking. Brown roulades all over, turning them, about 5 minutes total. Transfer skillet to middle of oven and bake roulades until just cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes.
While roulades are baking, mince garlic. Transfer chicken to a plate with tongs and keep warm, covered. Pour off fat from skillet. Add wine to skillet and deglaze over moderately high heat, scraping up brown bits. Boil wine until reduced to about 1 tablespoon and add garlic and butter. Cook mixture over moderately low heat, stirring, until fragrant. Add flour and cook roux, stirring, 1 minute. Add broth and cream and bring to a boil, whisking. Simmer sauce, whisking, 2 minutes and pour through a fine sieve into a small saucepan. Keep sauce warm. Carefully discard wooden picks from roulades and cut crosswise into 1/2-inch slices. Spoon some sauce in center of each of 4 plates and arrange roulade slices decoratively on sauce.

In a metal bowl or double boiler set over a saucepan of simmering water stir together oysters with their liquor, chili sauce, wine, Worcestershire sauce, celery salt, and 2 tablespoons butter and simmer, stirring occasionally, just until edges of oysters begin to curl, about 5 minutes. Add cream and bring barely to a simmer (do not let boil).
Put toast in 2 bowls and top with remaining butter. Ladle oyster mixture over toast and sprinkle with paprika.

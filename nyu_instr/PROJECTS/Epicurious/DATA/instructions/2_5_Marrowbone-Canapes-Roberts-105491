Have the ends sawed from three marrowbones in such a way that the marrow is exposed at both ends. Wrap them in a cloth, lower the cloth into a kettle of boiling water, and boil the bones for 10 minutes.
Into a large warmed bowl, put garlic, cream cheese, anchovy paste, and the hot marrow from the three bones. With a fork, mash the ingredients until they are blended, then chill the paste until firm.
Spread 1/4 inch of the mixture on a thin slice of bread, place another slice on top and cut the sandwich into four strips. Serve.

Bring potatoes and broth to simmer in heavy medium saucepan over high heat. Cover, reduce heat to medium and simmer 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 375°F. Lightly oil 8x8x2-inch glass baking dish. Using slotted spoon, arrange half of potatoes over bottom of prepared dish. Spread salsa over. Arrange remaining potatoes over. Pour chicken broth evenly over.

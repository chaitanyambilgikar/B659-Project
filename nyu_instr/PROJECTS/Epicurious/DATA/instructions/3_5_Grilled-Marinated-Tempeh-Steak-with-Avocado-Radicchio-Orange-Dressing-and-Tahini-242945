Make tahini sauce: In blender on high, blend tahini and garlic until smooth, about 30 seconds. With motor running, add 1/2 cup water, lemon juice, olive oil, salt, and pepper and blend until incorporated, about 30 seconds. (Tahini sauce can be prepared ahead and refrigerated, in airtight container, up to 2 days. If sauce is too thick after storage, whisk in several drops of water to thin.)
Marinate tempeh: Reserve 1/2 cup tahini sauce for serving. Brush remainder in thick layer over both sides of tempeh pieces. Transfer to airtight container and refrigerate at least 4 hours and up to 8 hours.
Make dressing: In a 2-quart pot over moderately high heat, bring orange juice to a boil. Lower heat to moderate and simmer, uncovered, until reduced by half, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer to large bowl and let cool to room temperature, about 15 minutes. Whisk in vinegar, then gradually whisk in olive oil, orange oil, salt, and pepper. (Dressing can be prepared ahead and refrigerated, in airtight container, up to 2 days. Whisk to reemulsify before using.)

Grill tempeh, turning once, until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Grill radicchio, turning once, until beginning to wilt, about 2 minutes per

Put oven rack in middle position and preheat to 375°F. Line a baking sheet with foil.
Whisk together soy sauce, hoisin sauce, oil, lemon juice, garlic, scallion, ginger, and pepper in a shallow bowl. Add salmon, turning to coat, and marinate, covered, at cool room temperature 30 minutes.
Remove salmon from marinade, letting excess drip off, and discard marinade. Bake salmon, skin sides down, on baking sheet until just cooked through, about 20 minutes. Lift salmon from skin with a metal spatula and transfer to a plate (discard skin).

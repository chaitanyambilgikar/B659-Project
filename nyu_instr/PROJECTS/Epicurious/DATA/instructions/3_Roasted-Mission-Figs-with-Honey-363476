Preheat the oven to 425°F. Rinse the figs and pat them dry, then cut off the stems and, without cutting through the base, halve them from top to bottom. Set the figs upright in a dish just big enough to hold them snugly.
Melt the butter in a small skillet with the salt, honey, and cinnamon, then spoon it over the figs.
Bake until the sauce is bubbling and the fruit is heated through, about 15 minutes. Serve warm.

Prepare grill.
Mince and mash onion to a coarse paste with thyme, sugar, salt, and spices. Pat pork chops dry and rub all over with jerk paste. Grill pork on an oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals 4 minutes on each side, or until just cooked through. (Alternatively, pork may be grilled in a hot well-seasoned ridged grill pan over moderately high heat.)

Steam all vegetables until potatoes are tender, about 8 minutes. Transfer to large bowl. Meanwhile, bring remaining ingredients to boil in medium saucepan, whisking until salt dissolves. Pour over vegetables. Let marinate at least 15 minutes, tossing occasionally. Serve warm or at room temperature.

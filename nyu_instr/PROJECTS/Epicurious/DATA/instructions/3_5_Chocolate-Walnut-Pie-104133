Preheat the oven to 350°F.
Melt the chocolate in the microwave or in a heavy pot on low heat. Pour it evenly into the unbaked pie shell.
In a large bowl, mix the eggs, corn syrup, sugar, butter, and vanilla well. Stir in the walnuts. Pour the mixture into the chocolate-lined pie shell and bake until the filling is set, 45 to 50 minutes. Remove to a rack and let cool.
The pie may be made ahead several days, or frozen for up to 3 months. Serve with whipped cream if desired.

Preheat oven to 350°F. and butter and flour six 1/2-cup muffin tins.
In a metal bowl set over a pan of simmering water melt chocolate with butter, whisking until smooth. Remove bowl from heat and whisk in sugar. Whisk in eggs, 1 at a time, and add remaining ingredients, whisking until combined well. Divide batter among prepared tins and bake in middle of oven until a tester comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.
Turn cakes out onto a rack and serve warm or at room temperature with accompaniments.

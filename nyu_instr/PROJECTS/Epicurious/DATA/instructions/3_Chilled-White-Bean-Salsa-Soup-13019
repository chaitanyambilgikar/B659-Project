In a 4-quart saucepan simmer beans, yellow onion, bay leaf, and thyme in water to cover by 3 inches, partially covered with lid, until beans are tender, about 50 minutes. Season beans with salt and cool completely in cooking liquid. Drain beans in a colander and discard yellow onion, bay leaf, and thyme. Beans may be cooked 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.
Finely chop enough of tomatoes to measure 1 1/2 cups and reserve. In a blender purée remaining tomatoes, half of bell peppers, and half of onion until smooth and in a bowl stir together purée, beans, reserved tomatoes, remaining bell peppers and red onion, jalapeño, vinegar, oil, and salt to taste. Chill soup, covered, at least until cold, about 6 hours, and up to 1 day. Before serving, stir in coriander and season with salt and pepper if necessary.

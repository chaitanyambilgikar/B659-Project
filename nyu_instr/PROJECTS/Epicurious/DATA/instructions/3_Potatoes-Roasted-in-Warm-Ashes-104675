1. Build a large fire in a fireplace or barbecue using wood, not charcoal briquets. Do not start the fire with fire starter, either, or there will be a residue of petroleum flavor in the ashes.
2. When the fire has generated a deep layer of warm embers, carefully move away the logs and bury the potatoes in the ashes. If they aren't completely buried it doesn't matter, but you'll need to rotate them once so they roast evenly. Roast them until they are tender through, which will take about 20 minutes.
3. Remove the foie gras from the refrigerator about 8 minutes before you remove the potatoes from the fire so it loses its chill but doesn't soften too much.
4. Remove and brush the ashes from the potatoes. Slit them down the center with a sharp knife, and push the ends towards the center to open up the potato. Insert a slice of foie gras into the potato and either season it with the salt and peppers, or leave that for your guests to do. Eat immediately!

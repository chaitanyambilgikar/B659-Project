Cook pasta in medium pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally.
Meanwhile, heat olive oil and re-served anchovy oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add anchovies, garlic, oregano and tomato paste; stir 1 minute. Add tomatoes; bring to boil. Add mussels. Cover; simmer until mussels open, about 5 minutes (discard any that do not open).
Drain pasta; divide between 2 shallow bowls. Top with mussels and sauce.

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Lightly oil a 13x9x2-inch baking pan.
2. Combine the molasses, butter, and coffee in a medium-size saucepan, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. As soon as it boils, remove from the heat. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl, or the bowl of an electric mixer, and let cool to lukewarm.
3. Sift the flour, salt, spices, and baking soda together onto a large piece of waxed paper.
4. Core, peel, and halve the apples, then slice them into 1/4-inch thick slices. Line the prepared pan with the apples slices, slightly overlapping them. Sprinkle them with the brown sugar.
5. Whisk the eggs into the molasses mixture. Add the dry ingredients and mix quickly but thoroughly. Then add the sour cream, mixing just until it is incorporated. Fold in the chocolate chips, and then pour the cake batter over the apple slices.
6. Bake in the center of the oven until the cake is mounded in the center and your finger leaves a slight indentation when you touch it, 50-55 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and transfer it to a wire rack to cool to lukewarm before serving. You may also serve it at room temperature, but it is best lukewarm.
7. To serve, cut the cake in pieces and turn them out of the pan upside down, so the apple slices are on top, or turn the entire cake out upside down onto a large serving platter and serve.

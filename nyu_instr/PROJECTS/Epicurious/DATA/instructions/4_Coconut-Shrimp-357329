Line baking sheet with parchment paper. Mix panko, coconut, lime peel, salt, and pepper in medium shallow bowl. Whisk eggs in another medium bowl to blend. Add shrimp to bowl with beaten eggs and toss to coat. Working with 1 shrimp at a time, remove shrimp from beaten eggs and turn to coat in panko mixture. Place shrimp on prepared baking sheet. DO AHEAD: Can be made 4 hours ahead. Cover and chill.

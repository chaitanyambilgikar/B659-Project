Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 375°F. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Thinly slice hearts of palm on the diagonal and put in a colander along with sliced onion. Rinse well under cold water and pat dry. Transfer to a large bowl and toss together with remaining salad ingredients.
Spread plantains on foil-lined baking sheet and bake until hot, 5 to 10 minutes.
While plantains bake, lightly oil grill pan and heat over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking.
Meanwhile, stir together jerk seasoning and oil in a small bowl and rub all over pork to coat. Grill pork, turning over once, until just cooked through, about 3 minutes total. Serve pork with salad and plantains.

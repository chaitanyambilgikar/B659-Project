Pat shrimp dry and season with 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then sauté shrimp, stirring frequently, until lightly browned and just cooked through, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a bowl.
Heat remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons oil in skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then sauté zucchini, stirring frequently, until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Add garlic and sauté, stirring, until zucchini is just tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Season with pepper and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt.
Cook pasta while zucchini is sautéing: Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water until al dente. Drain well in a colander and add to zucchini along with shrimp, zest, and basil. Cook over moderately high heat, tossing, until shrimp are heated through, about 1 minute.

Brush 13x9x2-inch glass baking dish with margarine. Steam half of potatoes and pears until very tender, about 15 minutes. Transfer to large bowl; cover to keep warm. Repeat steaming with remaining potatoes and pears. Empty pot. Return all potatoes and pears to pot. Add 6 tablespoons margarine; mash mixture well. Season with salt and pepper.
Melt 2 tablespoons margarine in large skillet. Add leeks; sauté until crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Mix half of leeks into potato mixture; transfer to prepared dish. Top with remaining leeks. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover; chill. Rewarm uncovered in 350°F oven 25 minutes.)

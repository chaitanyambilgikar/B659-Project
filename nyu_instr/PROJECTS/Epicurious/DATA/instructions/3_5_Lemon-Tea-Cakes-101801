Place the eggs and sugar in a large bowl; then, using a whisk or an electric mixer, beat until lemon colored. Add the zest. Fold in the flour, then 3/4 cup melted butter.
Refrigerate the batter, covered, for 1 hour.
Preheat the oven to 375°F(190°C.)
Butter the madeleine tins; then spoon in the batter, filling each well about three-fourths full. Bake 10 to 12 minutes, or until the madeleines are golden brown.
Remove the madeleines from their tins as soon as they're baked, and cool them on a wire rack. (Note: Wash the tins immediately with a stiff brush and hot water but no detergent so that they retain their seasoning.) The madeleines are best eaten as soon as they've cooled. They may, however, be stored for several days in an airtight container.

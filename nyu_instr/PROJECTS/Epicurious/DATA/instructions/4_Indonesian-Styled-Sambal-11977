In a bowl combine well the pineapple, the cucumber, the sugar, the shallot, the soy sauce, the lime juice, and salt to taste and let the sambal stand, covered and chilled, for 1 hour to let the flavors develop. The sambal keeps, covered and chilled, for 2 days. Serve the sambal as an accompaniment to curries and grilled meats.

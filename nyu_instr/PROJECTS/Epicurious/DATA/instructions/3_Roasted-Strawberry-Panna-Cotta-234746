Preheat oven to 350°F. Place 6 cups strawberries and 6 tarragon sprigs in 13x9x2-inch glass baking dish. Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons sugar and lemon juice; toss to coat. Roast uncovered until strawberries are soft and syrup forms, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes; cool 30 minutes.
Strain strawberry mixture into medium bowl, pressing on fruit to release as much pulp as possible; discard seeds in strainer. Transfer 1 1/2 cups strawberry purée to another medium bowl; mix in crème fraîche. Reserve any remaining purée for another use.
Place 2 1/2 tablespoons cold water in small saucepan; sprinkle gelatin over. Let stand until gelatin softens, about 15 minutes.
Scrape seeds from vanilla bean halves into another small saucepan; add bean. Add cream and remaining 1/2 cup sugar. Bring to simmer over medium heat, stirring until sugar dissolves. Remove cream mixture from heat; add gelatin mixture and stir to dissolve. Cool slightly. Stir cream-gelatin mixture into strawberry cream. Strain into large measuring cup; divide among six 3/4-cup ramekins or small goblets. Cover and chill until panna cotta is set, at least 6 hours and up to 1 day. Garnish with whole strawberries and remaining tarragon sprigs.

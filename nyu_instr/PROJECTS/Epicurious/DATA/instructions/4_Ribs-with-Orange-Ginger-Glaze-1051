Combine ribs, 1/4 cup soy sauce, sliced ginger, green onions and star anise in Dutch oven. Cover ribs with water. Simmer until ribs are cooked through, about 20 minutes. Cool to room temperature in cooking liquid. Drain ribs. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover; chill.)
Whisk broth, sugar, orange peel, minced ginger, garlic and 3 tablespoons soy sauce in bowl. Heat oil in wok or large skillet over high heat. Add ribs and broth mixture. Stir-fry until liquid is reduced to glaze, about 5 minutes.

Preheat broiler. Line rack of broiler pan with foil.
Finely chop scallions and stir together with mayonnaise. Pat fillets dry. Place fillets, skin sides down, on broiler pan and season each fillet with a generous pinch of salt and pepper. Spread scallion mixture evenly over tops of fillets.
Broil 3 to 4 inches from heat until scallions are slightly charred and fish is just cooked through, about 8 minutes.

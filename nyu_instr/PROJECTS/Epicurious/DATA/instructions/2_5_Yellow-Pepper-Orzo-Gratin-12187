In a 4-quart saucepan bring 3 quarts salted water to a boil for orzo.
In a heavy saucepan simmer bell peppers in wine and broth with salt, covered, until tender, about 15 minutes. Remove lid and simmer until liquid is evaporated. Cool pepper mixture and in a food processor or blender purée with egg. Transfer pepper mixture to a large bowl.
Preheat oven to 350° F. and lightly oil an 8-inch square baking pan with the oil.
Cook orzo in boiling salted water until al dente and drain in a colander. Rinse orzo under cold water and drain well. Stir orzo into pepper mixture with scallions, chives, 1 tablespoon Parmesan, and salt and pepper to taste. Spread orzo in baking pan, smoothing top, and sprinkle with remaining tablespoon Parmesan. Gratin may be prepared up to this point 8 hours ahead and chilled, covered.
Bake gratin in middle of oven 25 to 30 minutes, or until set and top is pale golden.

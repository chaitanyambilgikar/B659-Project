For aioli: Whisk vinegar, honey, and saffron threads in heavy small saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to boil. Remove from heat. Cool completely. Mix mayonnaise and garlic in medium bowl to blend. Mix in cooled vinegar mixture. Season aioli to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
For asparagus: Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Toss asparagus with oil on rimmed baking sheet. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill asparagus until crisp-tender, turning occasionally, about 5 minutes. Transfer to platter. Drizzle aioli over asparagus. Sprinkle with bell pepper.

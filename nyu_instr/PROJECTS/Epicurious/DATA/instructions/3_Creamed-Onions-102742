Cut off tip and root ends of onions. Peel, quarter, then separate onion layers. Cook onions in boiling salted water to cover in a 2-quart saucepan until tender, 15 to 20 minutes, and drain in a colander. Melt butter in saucepan over moderate heat. Add flour and cook, whisking, 1 minute. Add cream in a slow stream, whisking, and simmer, whisking, until thickened, about 2 minutes. Add onions, cloves, and salt and pepper to taste and gently simmer 5 minutes. Stir in parsley.

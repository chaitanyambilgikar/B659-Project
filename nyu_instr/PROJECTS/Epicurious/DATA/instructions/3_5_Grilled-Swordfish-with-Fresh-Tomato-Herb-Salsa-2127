Bring medium saucepan of water to boil. Add tomatoes and blanch 30 seconds. Drain. Transfer to medium bowl. Cover with cold water; cool. Peel tomatoes. Cut in half; squeeze out juices. Chop tomatoes; transfer to bowl. Add herbs, shallot, vinegar and 1 tablespoon oil. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be made 1 hour ahead. Let stand at room temperature.)
Prepare barbeque (medium-high heat) or preheat broiler. Brush fish with oil. Sprinkle with generous amount of peppercorns and salt. Grill until just cooked through, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer fish to plates. Spoon tomato salsa over and serve.

Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt in large bowl to blend. Freeze flour mixture 1 hour. Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 375°F. Transfer flour mixture to processor. Add butter and cut in using on/off turns until mixture resembles coarse meal. Return mixture to large bowl. Make well in center of mixture. Add chilled buttermilk and stir just until blended and moist clumps form. Turn dough out onto floured work surface. Gather dough together and pat into 1-inch-thick round (do not knead). Using 2 3/4-inch-diameter biscuit cutter, cut out biscuits. Transfer buttermilk biscuits to large ungreased baking sheet, spacing 1§ inches apart. Gather scraps and re-pat to 1-inch thickness, then cut out additional biscuits, for a total of 9.
Insert thumb into center of 1 biscuit, making deep indentation that almost reaches bottom, then push toward sides of biscuit to form 1-inch-diameter hole. Repeat with remaining biscuits. Spoon 1 tablespoon jam into each hole. Bake jam-filled biscuits until golden brown, about 25 minutes. Serve biscuits warm.

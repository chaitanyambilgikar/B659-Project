Blend butter and cheese in a food processor until almost smooth. Add remaining ingredients and pulse until just combined. Divide dough between 2 sheets of wax paper and roll each half into an 8-inch log. Freeze, wrapped in wax paper and then foil, until firm, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
Preheat oven to 350°F.
Cut 1 log crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices and arrange 1 inch apart on 2 buttered large baking sheets. Bake in upper and lower thirds of oven, switching position of sheets halfway through baking, until edges are golden brown, about 15 minutes. Transfer crackers to a rack to cool. Repeat with remaining dough.

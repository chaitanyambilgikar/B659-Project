Whisk 1/3 cup olive oil, pressed garlic, lemon peel, thyme, and 1/2 teaspoon sea salt in small bowl. Place fish, skin side down, in 13x9x2-inch glass baking dish. Brush marinade over top and sides of fish. Cover; chill at least 2 hours and up to 4 hours.
Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion, celery, tomatoes, chiles, and minced garlic. Sauté until vegetables are just soft, about 5 minutes. Mix in black beans and cumin. Reduce heat to medium and cook until flavors blend, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Season to taste with sea salt and pepper. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 hours ahead; let stand at room temperature.
Spray grill rack with nonstick spray and prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Arrange fish, skin side up, on rack; spray skin. Grill fish 4 to 5 minutes; turn over. Grill until fish is just opaque in center, about 3 minutes longer, depending on thickness.
Rewarm beans with 1/4 cup water over medium heat; mix in chopped cilantro. Place 1/2 cup beans on each plate; top with fish and dollop of Piment d'Espelette Mayonnaise ; garnish with cilantro leaves.

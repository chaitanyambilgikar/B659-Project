1. Preheat the broiler.
2. Toast the bread lightly in a toaster oven. Remove the crusts. Cut the slices with a 2-inch round biscuit cutter and spread the rounds lightly with mayonnaise. Put a slice of onion on top of each piece and spread with mayonnaise again. Broil until golden brown. Serve hot.
Ellen's Tips: You can add some chopped fresh parsley on top of the puffs after broiling. You can spread some hot and sweet mustard on top of the onion before the mayonnaise for a spicier version of this recipe.

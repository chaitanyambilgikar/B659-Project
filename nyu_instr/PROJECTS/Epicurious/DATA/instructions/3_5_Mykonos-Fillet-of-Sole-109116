Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 200°F.
Combine fish, half of lemon slices, wine, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a shallow dish. Marinate, covered, at room temperature 30 minutes.
Whisk together egg, milk, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in another shallow dish. Stir together bread crumbs, garlic, parsley, pepper, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt in a shallow bowl.
Dip fish pieces, 1 at a time, in egg mixture, letting excess drip off, then dredge in bread-crumb mixture, shaking off excess. Transfer to a sheet of wax paper, arranging fish in 1 layer.
Heat 2 tablespoons oil and 1/2 tablespoon butter in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then fry 2 pieces of fish, turning over once, until golden and just cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes total. Transfer to a baking sheet and keep warm in oven, then cook remaining 2 pieces of fish in remaining 2 tablespoons oil and 1/2 tablespoon butter in same manner. Serve fish with remaining lemon slices.

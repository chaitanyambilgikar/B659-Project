Using a sharp knife, cut pork fillets into 5 mm (1/4 inch) slices, then cut into 5 mm (1/4 inch) strips and set aside.
Heat half the oil in a hot wok until surface seems to shimmer slightly. Pour beaten eggs into wok and leave to cook on the base of the wok for 10 seconds before folding egg mixture over onto itself with a spatula and lightly scrambling for about 1 minute or until almost cooked through. Carefully remove omelette from wok with a spatula and drain on kitchen paper. Set aside.
Heat remaining oil in hot wok and stir-fry onion and ginger for 30 seconds. Add sugar and stir-fry for 30 seconds. Add pork and stir-fry for a further 30 seconds. Stir in hoisin sauce, soy sauce, vinegar, and sesame oil and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Toss in rice and reserved omelette and stir-fry, using a spatula to break up the egg into smaller pieces, for 1 minute. Lastly, add spring onions and stir-fry for a further 30 seconds or until well combined and rice is heated through.
Transfer rice to a platter and serve.

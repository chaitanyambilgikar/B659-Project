This does seem to be a hard task. If you think about it, just knowing the ingredients or just knowing the instructions can't tell you much about how the dish is going to taste like. And taste is what utimately decides the ratings. Still, we want to give a shot at it. Who knows, may be we might get some interesting results.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
